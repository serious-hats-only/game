Fenway lives up to the hype!

It was my first time at Fenway (and first time in Boston) and I knew I had to come to Fenway to watch a Redsox game! Not only that, but we also took a tour of the stadium, which I *highly* recommend if you haven't already. We got to go on the field during practice, sit on top of the Green Monster, and listen to the unique history story of Fenway!

The game was amazing, too. In my home state, I rarely ever see the stadium that full on a Monday night. Food is great, beers are cold and service is friendly. We had a really great time and it was honestly such a unique and amazing experience. I can see why so many people recommend coming to a game when you're in Boston! Truly one of the most amazing and memorable games I've been to so far. I wish I lived closer so I could go more often.
Ok, this place needs to train its staff BADLY. It's otherwise a fine historic stadium. 

The First Base Deck Bar had a server who asked "do you want you drink a little strong" and proceeded to make it a double and charge me accordingly? It was a gin and tonic. It was WAY TOO strong. Next time, ask if the person wants a double, flat out. 

Then, I waited in line for the First Base Deck Grill. It was a looong line. The marquee / TV said they had popcorn. When I went to order after waiting in line, she informed me there was no popcorn. I said "oh; your sign says you have popcorn" she said "yeah, well we don't." 

I then went to 5 other stands to find popcorn. Finally did. 

The women's bathroom near grand stand 16 had ceiling panels that were missing for no apparent reason. Big security flaw.
Let me start off by saying as a Boston sports fanatic and former JR high baseball player and huge baseball fan between the years 1998 and 2004, that I find baseball to be INCREDIBLY BORING. I can't remember the last time I watched a regular season game on TV or even a World Series game in the last decade. 

HOWEVER, I've been to Fenway park 5 times this summer. Why? Because Fenway Park is simply amazing. As a Boston sports fanatic I can definitively and objectively say it's the best baseball park in the World (even though I have only been to two) ;)

Especially if you come here on a warm summer evening, the energy can not be matched! 

Also, 90% of seats at Fenway are great and tickets are relatively inexpensive, starting at about $25 to $30 after fees when they're not playing the Yankees. 

Can't beat that! 

BTW, all of the food is overpriced similar to an amusement park or movie theater. 

If you're not into baseball, you come here socialize, grab a beer and hot dog and enjoy the sights and sounds and of course the game.
Sports history in action. I participated in their history tour where they take you to the old seating area and to the green monster. You can still see impressions of the hundreds of balls that have hit it. Oh and and this is where I discovered that the green monster seating isn't part of season tickets. It is first come first serve (just be prepared to pay a premium). Fenway also has partnerships that led to the develop of an urban garden.
Earlier this summer I got to see a game at Wrigley Field and that was a blast! We flew to Boston for 40 hours or so in the middle of a week in Washington DC just for the sole purpose of seeing a Red Sox game at Fenway Park! 

This was a fun and incredibly memorable experience! 

(+) I ended up grabbing some Grandstand seats in the 200 section along the Third Base line. After all fees and taxes, they basically ran about $75 each, out the door. 

They ended up being fantastic seats with a great view of the game, the scoreboard, and an interesting crowd of people around us! lol
(+) We watched an epic 4 hour plus battle between the Blue Jays and Red Sox that ended up being one hell of an entertaining game! The only thing that sucked was that the Jays won 6-5 in 10 innings. Bah. 

What a game though!
(+) We decided to go crazy and treat ourselves to a local Boston treat. We grabbed a couple of Lobster Rolls and a couple of Coke Zeros in Red Sox souvenir cups. This is not a cheap treat. lol You will pay market value for that lobster. We went in the last week of August and ended up paying roughly $35 per lobster roll! lol They do stuff that thing with a LOT of big fat chunks of lobster! So frickin' tasty!
(+) The area of restaurants, bars, and stores surrounding the field was a lot of fun and very lively! Grabbed some great food, souvenirs, and a drink before I even stepped foot in Fenway!
(+) The atmosphere was electric and so much fun! Between the 7th Inning stretch, multiple waves, Sweet Caroline, good old fashioned trash talk, and a near fight 3 rows in front of me, I felt like I was getting a vintage Boston experience! lol

The sounds of the game around my seating area:

Anytime the Red Sox were at bat: LET'S GO RED SOX! LET'S GO RED SOX! LETS'S GO RED SOX! 

Anytime the Blue Jays were at bat: YAH GAHBAGE! STRAIGHT GAHHHBAGE! YOU MUDDAFUCCA! GO BACK TO TORONTAH!

lol The sweet sounds of the game! 
(+) All employees we interacted with were friendly and fun and definitely added to the fun atmosphere. 

The only things I didn't like:
(-) Those hardwood seats are pretty brutal on the backside.....especially when the game goes well over 4 hours long! 
(-) We were staying at a hotel that was literally a 7-minute walk away, but when the game was letting out, they made us walk around the other side of the Ball Park to get there. Douches. Seemed pretty unnecessary. 

Despite those things, this was an incredibly fun and memorable experience! 
The only thing that would have made it better is if the Sox had won! Oh well, I guess you can't have it all. 

Bucket list item: Check! 

5 stars.
A great time at one of the country's most historic ballparks, and I'm not even a baseball fan, ha!

On a recent trip out to Boston, we were on the hunt to tick of all the must-dos and must-sees. Of course, Fenway Park sits on top of the list. My three friends and I attended a Thursday night game, and it was definitely a cool experience. The atmosphere surrounding the stadium is wild. People fill the streets and surrounding bars, good energy everywhere. 

Fenway Park itself, being over 100 years old, certainly has that old-school feel. The idea that this piece of history is still being used today is what makes it so great! Event the seating (though clearly updated since the early 1900s) are still throwback-style. We didn't pay for the greatest seats, yet the views of the game were still fantastic. 

The stadiums layout was easy to navigate, security wasn't tough to get through, the whole place was well-kept and clean, and drink/food prices were absolutely outrageous :) You know you've been to a sporting event when you come back with empty pockets!My husband grew up in the Boston area and RI, so I was excited to experience his love for the game and Fenway.

Our adult kids were geeking out, as it was their first time there, it was great to witness that, as well!

I'm not a baseball fan, but I did enjoy the beer, hot dogs and shopping for souvenirs! :)What's not to love about our beloved Fenway? The sausage carts on the streets, the vendors selling those tee's with the funny sayings. The vendors in the park walking around selling beers and hotdogs. The smell of popcorn and peanuts. They even have my Massachusetts favorite Lord Hobo. It can be a bit pricey but it's a stadium, it's expected. The atmosphere is just relaxing, and you can't help but to be happy there.
Ballpark (#18 of 30)*
*Of "current" MLB stadiums.

Fenway is a must as a baseball person. For years, I assumed it would be the final spot on [my friend and I's] MLB park tour. But as it goes, we stopped talking for months and now we have an awkward tension between us... anyway, he went to Fenway on his own, so I guessed I was going without him... anyway... I had the opportunity to come up here with two of my amazing neighbors, both of which are Brewers fans, to go to this weekend's game against the Brewers.

The stadium is a part of history and in a great neighborhood to explore when you are walkabouting in Boston. Compared to its equally as old counterpart, Wrigley, Fenway has the edge. I hesitate to speculate why, since it is a conglomeration of storytelling art school mind wandering and the wikipedia history of every MLB stadium rabbit hole.

The view we had behind the dugout was really nice. The protective netting disrupts the view somewhat; depending on your angle you might have to look right at the bundled 'edge' of the netting. Sometimes balls sneak in through the top part of the net. Free stuff! 

Worth going if: a) Red Sox Fan b) baseball stadium tourer c) history nerd.
What a cool piece of history that's still standing and still being used today.

One of the must do things while in Boston is to do a tour of Fenway park. Luckily the days we were here there was no ball game, so we were able to get in on a tour last minute. It was the last tour of the day and we took a Uber and rushed there and made it just in time.

Our tour guide was awesome and had a lot of great information to share with us regarding the history of the park and some of the key players like Babe Ruth. The whole tour took about an hour and a half. We even got to go into the media box which was super cool. 

I thought the tour was very well organized and very well done. We definitely had so much fun and got to see the park and so many different angles. 

Highly recommend!Drove to Beantown for a midsummer/midweek game versus the Rays. My anticipation was bursting with my inner child's enthusiasm for the Cathedral of Baseball!

It did not disappoint, it actually exceeded my lofty expectations. We excitedly entered at a gate that was the farthest from our section. No worries. This afforded us the opportunity to explore all of Fenway. I experienced sensory overload with all of the heavenly food smells, and sounds of vendors, and sights of the tributes to Redsox from near and far. Foxx, Williams, Yaz, Lynn, Rice, Clemens, Pedro, Big Papi. Awesome! 

We settled in to our seats in Section 32, Row 4, adjacent to the Monster. Perfectly shaded view down the 1st base side in a Non alcoholic section (unintentional). Enjoyed chatting with our Usher, aka Eagle eye, and fans around us. One of the fans was kind enough to give us detailed directions back to our parked car. Thanks Dave. All in all, a memorable day! Even if you are'nt a Redsox fan ( I am a sillies fan) check them out!2nd time doing the fenway tour. This time they were setting up for a concert. We did a different route in the building this time, so got to see a different route. 
The bonus this tour, got to see the world series trophies    
Tour is an hour long. Wheelchair and stroller accessible.
We had a great day today at our first ever ballgame at Fenway.  The game was close, there were plenty of fun diversions and security presence kept everyone being nice to each other :)

Lots of kids enjoying this summer day and loved that the players handed out so many balls after practice.  

I did take a few pictures of menus inside the park as I was really curious what food was going to cost us; so hopefully this is helpful.  We did see a plant based cheeseburger offering and several gluten free bun signs as well.  Most people had dogs, pizza or chicken tenders.  

There are plenty more options outside the park on Jersey and the surrounding streets if you prefer either a food cart or a sit down restaurant or bar.
Took the Worcester Line from South Station to Lansdowne Station and walked right up to Fenway.  Made the mistake of getting a sausage inside rather than the carts on Yawkey Way (didn't look near as good) but we had great seats. It was picture day so we got to go down on the field, get some pics with the players and the green monster. Seventh inning stretch, Sweet Caroline in the eighth, and the Red Sox won!! A great day all around!Driving in from Maine, I asked my wife if the Red Sox were in town for the evening and after she saw that they were playing the Yankees, I knew my son and I needed to experience a game at Fenway Park!

I absolutely loved every moment of this experience especially coming from Dodger Stadium and going to Dodger games. Dodger fans are passionate but are out done by Red Sox fans!  I love the quaintness of this ballpark, the fans were amazing, and the history of this place speaks for itself.

We were sitting in grandstand 12 row four which had a great view and no pillar in front of it. We were lucky that the Red Sox beat the Yankees so the crowd was extremely excited especially because the Red Sox came from behind to win the game.

I highly recommend anybody to watch the game at this great ballpark. I hope it's here for generations to come! Please don't change a thing!There are a lot of reasons people could argue that Fenway Park does not "deserve" a 5-star rating: uncomfortable grandstand seats that sometimes seem like they face the wrong direction, poorly placed poles that block your view, overpriced beer and mediocre food, etc. But, there is simply no better environment to enjoy a MLB game. The stadium is intimate, the crowd is electric, the talent on the field is usually top notch, the neighborhood is delightful pre- and post-game. If you've been to Fenway, you'll likely return at every chance you get. If you haven't been, it's a must experience when in Boston.
Amazing venue for a concert! Aerosmith 50th anniversary tour was EPIC! Will definitely be back to Fenway for future concerts.
Came here for the Fenway Park tour and learned so much about the park. I'm not a baseball person but I enjoyed the tour. I would recommend the tour especially if you're a baseball fan. It's a great stadium but the seats aren't super comfortable so can't imagine sitting through a whole game here.
I live in Toronto, it has a horrendous ballpark (SKYDOME), often listed in the top 2 worst of MLB's baseball park cities.  So out of 30 being late ain't great!
I should add I like checking out baseball parks, but find the game tortuously slow and boring.  
Fenway was amazing.  The ambiance, the breeze passing through.  The ability to roam around a bit, see multiple sections and locations.  Modern washroom also nice!  If I lived here, I'd go to a handful of games, a great Boston experience.  I wouldn't stay for nine innings (no chance!), but I'd buy tickets and maybe the sport grows on me... the ballpark experience is so key to MLB.
Two negatives; massive souvenir shop; but not a T-shirt under $40.  And $12 USD for cups of beer.
This was my first time at a baseball stadium so I have nothing to compare this to. It was pretty organized though and the people working there were good at telling us where to go. Since we got there after the game started, there wasn't a line to get in and the security check was very light and easy. 

Food is definitely expensive so I didn't even bother. I had some money loaded into my ticket and it was very difficult to find a place in the stadium that accepted it. Eventually, we found that the larger merchandise store by one of the entrances takes it so we were finally able to use it.

Sports history in action. I participated in their history tour where they take you to the old seating area and to the green monster. You can still see impressions of the hundreds of balls that have hit it. Oh and and this is where I discovered that the green monster seating isn't part of season tickets. It is first come first serve (just be prepared to pay a premium). Fenway also has partnerships that led to the develop of an urban garden.
Earlier this summer I got to see a game at Wrigley Field and that was a blast! We flew to Boston for 40 hours or so in the middle of a week in Washington DC just for the sole purpose of seeing a Red Sox game at Fenway Park! 

This was a fun and incredibly memorable experience! 

(+) I ended up grabbing some Grandstand seats in the 200 section along the Third Base line. After all fees and taxes, they basically ran about $75 each, out the door. 

They ended up being fantastic seats with a great view of the game, the scoreboard, and an interesting crowd of people around us! lol
(+) We watched an epic 4 hour plus battle between the Blue Jays and Red Sox that ended up being one hell of an entertaining game! The only thing that sucked was that the Jays won 6-5 in 10 innings. Bah. 

What a game though!
(+) We decided to go crazy and treat ourselves to a local Boston treat. We grabbed a couple of Lobster Rolls and a couple of Coke Zeros in Red Sox souvenir cups. This is not a cheap treat. lol You will pay market value for that lobster. We went in the last week of August and ended up paying roughly $35 per lobster roll! lol They do stuff that thing with a LOT of big fat chunks of lobster! So frickin' tasty!
(+) The area of restaurants, bars, and stores surrounding the field was a lot of fun and very lively! Grabbed some great food, souvenirs, and a drink before I even stepped foot in Fenway!
(+) The atmosphere was electric and so much fun! Between the 7th Inning stretch, multiple waves, Sweet Caroline, good old fashioned trash talk, and a near fight 3 rows in front of me, I felt like I was getting a vintage Boston experience! lol

The sounds of the game around my seating area:

Anytime the Red Sox were at bat: LET'S GO RED SOX! LET'S GO RED SOX! LETS'S GO RED SOX! 

Anytime the Blue Jays were at bat: YAH GAHBAGE! STRAIGHT GAHHHBAGE! YOU MUDDAFUCCA! GO BACK TO TORONTAH!

lol The sweet sounds of the game! 
(+) All employees we interacted with were friendly and fun and definitely added to the fun atmosphere. 

The only things I didn't like:
(-) Those hardwood seats are pretty brutal on the backside.....especially when the game goes well over 4 hours long! 
(-) We were staying at a hotel that was literally a 7-minute walk away, but when the game was letting out, they made us walk around the other side of the Ball Park to get there. Douches. Seemed pretty unnecessary. 

Despite those things, this was an incredibly fun and memorable experience! 
The only thing that would have made it better is if the Sox had won! Oh well, I guess you can't have it all. 

Bucket list item: Check! 

5 stars.
A great time at one of the country's most historic ballparks, and I'm not even a baseball fan, ha!

On a recent trip out to Boston, we were on the hunt to tick of all the must-dos and must-sees. Of course, Fenway Park sits on top of the list. My three friends and I attended a Thursday night game, and it was definitely a cool experience. The atmosphere surrounding the stadium is wild. People fill the streets and surrounding bars, good energy everywhere. 

Fenway Park itself, being over 100 years old, certainly has that old-school feel. The idea that this piece of history is still being used today is what makes it so great! Event the seating (though clearly updated since the early 1900s) are still throwback-style. We didn't pay for the greatest seats, yet the views of the game were still fantastic. 

The stadiums layout was easy to navigate, security wasn't tough to get through, the whole place was well-kept and clean, and drink/food prices were absolutely outrageous :) You know you've been to a sporting event when you come back with empty pockets!My husband grew up in the Boston area and RI, so I was excited to experience his love for the game and Fenway.

Our adult kids were geeking out, as it was their first time there, it was great to witness that, as well!

I'm not a baseball fan, but I did enjoy the beer, hot dogs and shopping for souvenirs! :)What's not to love about our beloved Fenway? The sausage carts on the streets, the vendors selling those tee's with the funny sayings. The vendors in the park walking around selling beers and hotdogs. The smell of popcorn and peanuts. They even have my Massachusetts favorite Lord Hobo. It can be a bit pricey but it's a stadium, it's expected. The atmosphere is just relaxing, and you can't help but to be happy there.
Ballpark (#18 of 30)*
*Of "current" MLB stadiums.

Fenway is a must as a baseball person. For years, I assumed it would be the final spot on [my friend and I's] MLB park tour. But as it goes, we stopped talking for months and now we have an awkward tension between us... anyway, he went to Fenway on his own, so I guessed I was going without him... anyway... I had the opportunity to come up here with two of my amazing neighbors, both of which are Brewers fans, to go to this weekend's game against the Brewers.

The stadium is a part of history and in a great neighborhood to explore when you are walkabouting in Boston. Compared to its equally as old counterpart, Wrigley, Fenway has the edge. I hesitate to speculate why, since it is a conglomeration of storytelling art school mind wandering and the wikipedia history of every MLB stadium rabbit hole.

The view we had behind the dugout was really nice. The protective netting disrupts the view somewhat; depending on your angle you might have to look right at the bundled 'edge' of the netting. Sometimes balls sneak in through the top part of the net. Free stuff! 

Worth going if: a) Red Sox Fan b) baseball stadium tourer c) history nerd.
What a cool piece of history that's still standing and still being used today.

One of the must do things while in Boston is to do a tour of Fenway park. Luckily the days we were here there was no ball game, so we were able to get in on a tour last minute. It was the last tour of the day and we took a Uber and rushed there and made it just in time.

Our tour guide was awesome and had a lot of great information to share with us regarding the history of the park and some of the key players like Babe Ruth. The whole tour took about an hour and a half. We even got to go into the media box which was super cool. 

I thought the tour was very well organized and very well done. We definitely had so much fun and got to see the park and so many different angles. 

Highly recommend!Drove to Beantown for a midsummer/midweek game versus the Rays. My anticipation was bursting with my inner child's enthusiasm for the Cathedral of Baseball!

It did not disappoint, it actually exceeded my lofty expectations. We excitedly entered at a gate that was the farthest from our section. No worries. This afforded us the opportunity to explore all of Fenway. I experienced sensory overload with all of the heavenly food smells, and sounds of vendors, and sights of the tributes to Redsox from near and far. Foxx, Williams, Yaz, Lynn, Rice, Clemens, Pedro, Big Papi. Awesome! 

We settled in to our seats in Section 32, Row 4, adjacent to the Monster. Perfectly shaded view down the 1st base side in a Non alcoholic section (unintentional). Enjoyed chatting with our Usher, aka Eagle eye, and fans around us. One of the fans was kind enough to give us detailed directions back to our parked car. Thanks Dave. All in all, a memorable day! Even if you are'nt a Redsox fan ( I am a sillies fan) check them out!2nd time doing the fenway tour. This time they were setting up for a concert. We did a different route in the building this time, so got to see a different route. 
The bonus this tour, got to see the world series trophies    
Tour is an hour long. Wheelchair and stroller accessible.
We had a great day today at our first ever ballgame at Fenway.  The game was close, there were plenty of fun diversions and security presence kept everyone being nice to each other :)

Lots of kids enjoying this summer day and loved that the players handed out so many balls after practice.  

I did take a few pictures of menus inside the park as I was really curious what food was going to cost us; so hopefully this is helpful.  We did see a plant based cheeseburger offering and several gluten free bun signs as well.  Most people had dogs, pizza or chicken tenders.  

There are plenty more options outside the park on Jersey and the surrounding streets if you prefer either a food cart or a sit down restaurant or bar.
Took the Worcester Line from South Station to Lansdowne Station and walked right up to Fenway.  Made the mistake of getting a sausage inside rather than the carts on Yawkey Way (didn't look near as good) but we had great seats. It was picture day so we got to go down on the field, get some pics with the players and the green monster. Seventh inning stretch, Sweet Caroline in the eighth, and the Red Sox won!! A great day all around!Driving in from Maine, I asked my wife if the Red Sox were in town for the evening and after she saw that they were playing the Yankees, I knew my son and I needed to experience a game at Fenway Park!

I absolutely loved every moment of this experience especially coming from Dodger Stadium and going to Dodger games. Dodger fans are passionate but are out done by Red Sox fans!  I love the quaintness of this ballpark, the fans were amazing, and the history of this place speaks for itself.

We were sitting in grandstand 12 row four which had a great view and no pillar in front of it. We were lucky that the Red Sox beat the Yankees so the crowd was extremely excited especially because the Red Sox came from behind to win the game.

I highly recommend anybody to watch the game at this great ballpark. I hope it's here for generations to come! Please don't change a thing!There are a lot of reasons people could argue that Fenway Park does not "deserve" a 5-star rating: uncomfortable grandstand seats that sometimes seem like they face the wrong direction, poorly placed poles that block your view, overpriced beer and mediocre food, etc. But, there is simply no better environment to enjoy a MLB game. The stadium is intimate, the crowd is electric, the talent on the field is usually top notch, the neighborhood is delightful pre- and post-game. If you've been to Fenway, you'll likely return at every chance you get. If you haven't been, it's a must experience when in Boston.
Amazing venue for a concert! Aerosmith 50th anniversary tour was EPIC! Will definitely be back to Fenway for future concerts.
Came here for the Fenway Park tour and learned so much about the park. I'm not a baseball person but I enjoyed the tour. I would recommend the tour especially if you're a baseball fan. It's a great stadium but the seats aren't super comfortable so can't imagine sitting through a whole game here.
I live in Toronto, it has a horrendous ballpark (SKYDOME), often listed in the top 2 worst of MLB's baseball park cities.  So out of 30 being late ain't great!
I should add I like checking out baseball parks, but find the game tortuously slow and boring.  
Fenway was amazing.  The ambiance, the breeze passing through.  The ability to roam around a bit, see multiple sections and locations.  Modern washroom also nice!  If I lived here, I'd go to a handful of games, a great Boston experience.  I wouldn't stay for nine innings (no chance!), but I'd buy tickets and maybe the sport grows on me... the ballpark experience is so key to MLB.
Two negatives; massive souvenir shop; but not a T-shirt under $40.  And $12 USD for cups of beer.
This was my first time at a baseball stadium so I have nothing to compare this to. It was pretty organized though and the people working there were good at telling us where to go. Since we got there after the game started, there wasn't a line to get in and the security check was very light and easy. 

Food is definitely expensive so I didn't even bother. I had some money loaded into my ticket and it was very difficult to find a place in the stadium that accepted it. Eventually, we found that the larger merchandise store by one of the entrances takes it so we were finally able to use it.
Fenway lives up to the hype!

It was my first time at Fenway (and first time in Boston) and I knew I had to come to Fenway to watch a Redsox game! Not only that, but we also took a tour of the stadium, which I *highly* recommend if you haven't already. We got to go on the field during practice, sit on top of the Green Monster, and listen to the unique history story of Fenway!

The game was amazing, too. In my home state, I rarely ever see the stadium that full on a Monday night. Food is great, beers are cold and service is friendly. We had a really great time and it was honestly such a unique and amazing experience. I can see why so many people recommend coming to a game when you're in Boston! Truly one of the most amazing and memorable games I've been to so far. I wish I lived closer so I could go more often.
Ok, this place needs to train its staff BADLY. It's otherwise a fine historic stadium. 

The First Base Deck Bar had a server who asked "do you want you drink a little strong" and proceeded to make it a double and charge me accordingly? It was a gin and tonic. It was WAY TOO strong. Next time, ask if the person wants a double, flat out. 

Then, I waited in line for the First Base Deck Grill. It was a looong line. The marquee / TV said they had popcorn. When I went to order after waiting in line, she informed me there was no popcorn. I said "oh; your sign says you have popcorn" she said "yeah, well we don't." 

I then went to 5 other stands to find popcorn. Finally did. 

The women's bathroom near grand stand 16 had ceiling panels that were missing for no apparent reason. Big security flaw.
Let me start off by saying as a Boston sports fanatic and former JR high baseball player and huge baseball fan between the years 1998 and 2004, that I find baseball to be INCREDIBLY BORING. I can't remember the last time I watched a regular season game on TV or even a World Series game in the last decade. 

HOWEVER, I've been to Fenway park 5 times this summer. Why? Because Fenway Park is simply amazing. As a Boston sports fanatic I can definitively and objectively say it's the best baseball park in the World (even though I have only been to two) ;)

Especially if you come here on a warm summer evening, the energy can not be matched! 

Also, 90% of seats at Fenway are great and tickets are relatively inexpensive, starting at about $25 to $30 after fees when they're not playing the Yankees. 

Can't beat that! 

BTW, all of the food is overpriced similar to an amusement park or movie theater.

(-) Those hardwood seats are pretty brutal on the backside.....especially when the game goes well over 4 hours long! 
(-) We were staying at a hotel that was literally a 7-minute walk away, but when the game was letting out, they made us walk around the other side of the Ball Park to get there. Douches. Seemed pretty unnecessary. 

Despite those things, this was an incredibly fun and memorable experience! 
The only thing that would have made it better is if the Sox had won! Oh well, I guess you can't have it all. 

Bucket list item: Check! 

5 stars.
A great time at one of the country's most historic ballparks, and I'm not even a baseball fan, ha!

On a recent trip out to Boston, we were on the hunt to tick of all the must-dos and must-sees. Of course, Fenway Park sits on top of the list. My three friends and I attended a Thursday night game, and it was definitely a cool experience. The atmosphere surrounding the stadium is wild. People fill the streets and surrounding bars, good energy everywhere. 

Fenway Park itself, being over 100 years old, certainly has that old-school feel. The idea that this piece of history is still being used today is what makes it so great! Event the seating (though clearly updated since the early 1900s) are still throwback-style. We didn't pay for the greatest seats, yet the views of the game were still fantastic. 

The stadiums layout was easy to navigate, security wasn't tough to get through, the whole place was well-kept and clean, and drink/food prices were absolutely outrageous :) You know you've been to a sporting event when you come back with empty pockets!My husband grew up in the Boston area and RI, so I was excited to experience his love for the game and Fenway.

Our adult kids were geeking out, as it was their first time there, it was great to witness that, as well!

I'm not a baseball fan, but I did enjoy the beer, hot dogs and shopping for souvenirs! :)What's not to love about our beloved Fenway? The sausage carts on the streets, the vendors selling those tee's with the funny sayings. The vendors in the park walking around selling beers and hotdogs. The smell of popcorn and peanuts. They even have my Massachusetts favorite Lord Hobo. It can be a bit pricey but it's a stadium, it's expected. The atmosphere is just relaxing, and you can't help but to be happy there.
Ballpark (#18 of 30)*
*Of "current" MLB stadiums.

Fenway is a must as a baseball person. For years, I assumed it would be the final spot on [my friend and I's] MLB park tour. But as it goes, we stopped talking for months and now we have an awkward tension between us... anyway, he went to Fenway on his own, so I guessed I was going without him... anyway... I had the opportunity to come up here with two of my amazing neighbors, both of which are Brewers fans, to go to this weekend's game against the Brewers.

The stadium is a part of history and in a great neighborhood to explore when you are walkabouting in Boston. Compared to its equally as old counterpart, Wrigley, Fenway has the edge. I hesitate to speculate why, since it is a conglomeration of storytelling art school mind wandering and the wikipedia history of every MLB stadium rabbit hole.

The view we had behind the dugout was really nice. The protective netting disrupts the view somewhat; depending on your angle you might have to look right at the bundled 'edge' of the netting. Sometimes balls sneak in through the top part of the net. Free stuff! 

Worth going if: a) Red Sox Fan b) baseball stadium tourer c) history nerd.
What a cool piece of history that's still standing and still being used today.

One of the must do things while in Boston is to do a tour of Fenway park. Luckily the days we were here there was no ball game, so we were able to get in on a tour last minute. It was the last tour of the day and we took a Uber and rushed there and made it just in time.

Our tour guide was awesome and had a lot of great information to share with us regarding the history of the park and some of the key players like Babe Ruth. The whole tour took about an hour and a half. We even got to go into the media box which was super cool. 

I thought the tour was very well organized and very well done. We definitely had so much fun and got to see the park and so many different angles. 

Highly recommend!Drove to Beantown for a midsummer/midweek game versus the Rays. My anticipation was bursting with my inner child's enthusiasm for the Cathedral of Baseball!

It did not disappoint, it actually exceeded my lofty expectations. We excitedly entered at a gate that was the farthest from our section. No worries. This afforded us the opportunity to explore all of Fenway. I experienced sensory overload with all of the heavenly food smells, and sounds of vendors, and sights of the tributes to Redsox from near and far. Foxx, Williams, Yaz, Lynn, Rice, Clemens, Pedro, Big Papi. Awesome! 

We settled in to our seats in Section 32, Row 4, adjacent to the Monster. Perfectly shaded view down the 1st base side in a Non alcoholic section (unintentional). Enjoyed chatting with our Usher, aka Eagle eye, and fans around us. One of the fans was kind enough to give us detailed directions back to our parked car. Thanks Dave. All in all, a memorable day! Even if you are'nt a Redsox fan ( I am a sillies fan) check them out!2nd time doing the fenway tour. This time they were setting up for a concert. We did a different route in the building this time, so got to see a different route. 
The bonus this tour, got to see the world series trophies    
Tour is an hour long. Wheelchair and stroller accessible.
We had a great day today at our first ever ballgame at Fenway.  The game was close, there were plenty of fun diversions and security presence kept everyone being nice to each other :)

Lots of kids enjoying this summer day and loved that the players handed out so many balls after practice.  

I did take a few pictures of menus inside the park as I was really curious what food was going to cost us; so hopefully this is helpful.  We did see a plant based cheeseburger offering and several gluten free bun signs as well.  Most people had dogs, pizza or chicken tenders.  

There are plenty more options outside the park on Jersey and the surrounding streets if you prefer either a food cart or a sit down restaurant or bar.
Took the Worcester Line from South Station to Lansdowne Station and walked right up to Fenway.  Made the mistake of getting a sausage inside rather than the carts on Yawkey Way (didn't look near as good) but we had great seats. It was picture day so we got to go down on the field, get some pics with the players and the green monster. Seventh inning stretch, Sweet Caroline in the eighth, and the Red Sox won!! A great day all around!Driving in from Maine, I asked my wife if the Red Sox were in town for the evening and after she saw that they were playing the Yankees, I knew my son and I needed to experience a game at Fenway Park!

I absolutely loved every moment of this experience especially coming from Dodger Stadium and going to Dodger games. Dodger fans are passionate but are out done by Red Sox fans!  I love the quaintness of this ballpark, the fans were amazing, and the history of this place speaks for itself.

We were sitting in grandstand 12 row four which had a great view and no pillar in front of it. We were lucky that the Red Sox beat the Yankees so the crowd was extremely excited especially because the Red Sox came from behind to win the game.

I highly recommend anybody to watch the game at this great ballpark. I hope it's here for generations to come! Please don't change a thing!There are a lot of reasons people could argue that Fenway Park does not "deserve" a 5-star rating: uncomfortable grandstand seats that sometimes seem like they face the wrong direction, poorly placed poles that block your view, overpriced beer and mediocre food, etc. But, there is simply no better environment to enjoy a MLB game. The stadium is intimate, the crowd is electric, the talent on the field is usually top notch, the neighborhood is delightful pre- and post-game. If you've been to Fenway, you'll likely return at every chance you get. If you haven't been, it's a must experience when in Boston.
Amazing venue for a concert! Aerosmith 50th anniversary tour was EPIC! Will definitely be back to Fenway for future concerts.
Came here for the Fenway Park tour and learned so much about the park. I'm not a baseball person but I enjoyed the tour. I would recommend the tour especially if you're a baseball fan. It's a great stadium but the seats aren't super comfortable so can't imagine sitting through a whole game here.
I live in Toronto, it has a horrendous ballpark (SKYDOME), often listed in the top 2 worst of MLB's baseball park cities.  So out of 30 being late ain't great!
I should add I like checking out baseball parks, but find the game tortuously slow and boring.  
Fenway was amazing.  The ambiance, the breeze passing through.  The ability to roam around a bit, see multiple sections and locations.  Modern washroom also nice!  If I lived here, I'd go to a handful of games, a great Boston experience.  I wouldn't stay for nine innings (no chance!), but I'd buy tickets and maybe the sport grows on me... the ballpark experience is so key to MLB.
Two negatives; massive souvenir shop; but not a T-shirt under $40.  And $12 USD for cups of beer.
This was my first time at a baseball stadium so I have nothing to compare this to. It was pretty organized though and the people working there were good at telling us where to go. Since we got there after the game started, there wasn't a line to get in and the security check was very light and easy. 

Food is definitely expensive so I didn't even bother. I had some money loaded into my ticket and it was very difficult to find a place in the stadium that accepted it. Eventually, we found that the larger merchandise store by one of the entrances takes it so we were finally able to use it.
Fenway lives up to the hype!

It was my first time at Fenway (and first time in Boston) and I knew I had to come to Fenway to watch a Redsox game! Not only that, but we also took a tour of the stadium, which I *highly* recommend if you haven't already. We got to go on the field during practice, sit on top of the Green Monster, and listen to the unique history story of Fenway!

The game was amazing, too. In my home state, I rarely ever see the stadium that full on a Monday night. Food is great, beers are cold and service is friendly. We had a really great time and it was honestly such a unique and amazing experience. I can see why so many people recommend coming to a game when you're in Boston! Truly one of the most amazing and memorable games I've been to so far. I wish I lived closer so I could go more often.
Ok, this place needs to train its staff BADLY. It's otherwise a fine historic stadium. 

The First Base Deck Bar had a server who asked "do you want you drink a little strong" and proceeded to make it a double and charge me accordingly? It was a gin and tonic. It was WAY TOO strong. Next time, ask if the person wants a double, flat out. 

Then, I waited in line for the First Base Deck Grill. It was a looong line. The marquee / TV said they had popcorn. When I went to order after waiting in line, she informed me there was no popcorn. I said "oh; your sign says you have popcorn" she said "yeah, well we don't." 

I then went to 5 other stands to find popcorn. Finally did. 

The women's bathroom near grand stand 16 had ceiling panels that were missing for no apparent reason. Big security flaw.
Let me start off by saying as a Boston sports fanatic and former JR high baseball player and huge baseball fan between the years 1998 and 2004, that I find baseball to be INCREDIBLY BORING. I can't remember the last time I watched a regular season game on TV or even a World Series game in the last decade. 

HOWEVER, I've been to Fenway park 5 times this summer. Why? Because Fenway Park is simply amazing. As a Boston sports fanatic I can definitively and objectively say it's the best baseball park in the World (even though I have only been to two) ;)

Especially if you come here on a warm summer evening, the energy can not be matched! 

Also, 90% of seats at Fenway are great and tickets are relatively inexpensive, starting at about $25 to $30 after fees when they're not playing the Yankees. 

Can't beat that! 

BTW, all of the food is overpriced similar to an amusement park or movie theater. 

If you're not into baseball, you come here socialize, grab a beer and hot dog and enjoy the sights and sounds and of course the game.
Sports history in action. I participated in their history tour where they take you to the old seating area and to the green monster. You can still see impressions of the hundreds of balls that have hit it. Oh and and this is where I discovered that the green monster seating isn't part of season tickets. It is first come first serve (just be prepared to pay a premium). Fenway also has partnerships that led to the develop of an urban garden.
Earlier this summer I got to see a game at Wrigley Field and that was a blast! We flew to Boston for 40 hours or so in the middle of a week in Washington DC just for the sole purpose of seeing a Red Sox game at Fenway Park! 

This was a fun and incredibly memorable experience! 

(+) I ended up grabbing some Grandstand seats in the 200 section along the Third Base line. After all fees and taxes, they basically ran about $75 each, out the door. 

They ended up being fantastic seats with a great view of the game, the scoreboard, and an interesting crowd of people around us! lol
(+) We watched an epic 4 hour plus battle between the Blue Jays and Red Sox that ended up being one hell of an entertaining game! The only thing that sucked was that the Jays won 6-5 in 10 innings. Bah. 

What a game though!
(+) We decided to go crazy and treat ourselves to a local Boston treat. We grabbed a couple of Lobster Rolls and a couple of Coke Zeros in Red Sox souvenir cups. This is not a cheap treat. lol You will pay market value for that lobster. We went in the last week of August and ended up paying roughly $35 per lobster roll! lol They do stuff that thing with a LOT of big fat chunks of lobster! So frickin' tasty!
(+) The area of restaurants, bars, and stores surrounding the field was a lot of fun and very lively! Grabbed some great food, souvenirs, and a drink before I even stepped foot in Fenway!
(+) The atmosphere was electric and so much fun! Between the 7th Inning stretch, multiple waves, Sweet Caroline, good old fashioned trash talk, and a near fight 3 rows in front of me, I felt like I was getting a vintage Boston experience! lol

The sounds of the game around my seating area:

Anytime the Red Sox were at bat: LET'S GO RED SOX! LET'S GO RED SOX! LETS'S GO RED SOX! 

Anytime the Blue Jays were at bat: YAH GAHBAGE! STRAIGHT GAHHHBAGE! YOU MUDDAFUCCA! GO BACK TO TORONTAH!

lol The sweet sounds of the game! 
(+) All employees we interacted with were friendly and fun and definitely added to the fun atmosphere. 

The only things I didn't like:
(-) Those hardwood seats are pretty brutal on the backside.....especially when the game goes well over 4 hours long!

But as it goes, we stopped talking for months and now we have an awkward tension between us... anyway, he went to Fenway on his own, so I guessed I was going without him... anyway... I had the opportunity to come up here with two of my amazing neighbors, both of which are Brewers fans, to go to this weekend's game against the Brewers.

The stadium is a part of history and in a great neighborhood to explore when you are walkabouting in Boston. Compared to its equally as old counterpart, Wrigley, Fenway has the edge. I hesitate to speculate why, since it is a conglomeration of storytelling art school mind wandering and the wikipedia history of every MLB stadium rabbit hole.

The view we had behind the dugout was really nice. The protective netting disrupts the view somewhat; depending on your angle you might have to look right at the bundled 'edge' of the netting. Sometimes balls sneak in through the top part of the net. Free stuff! 

Worth going if: a) Red Sox Fan b) baseball stadium tourer c) history nerd.
What a cool piece of history that's still standing and still being used today.

One of the must do things while in Boston is to do a tour of Fenway park. Luckily the days we were here there was no ball game, so we were able to get in on a tour last minute. It was the last tour of the day and we took a Uber and rushed there and made it just in time.

Our tour guide was awesome and had a lot of great information to share with us regarding the history of the park and some of the key players like Babe Ruth. The whole tour took about an hour and a half. We even got to go into the media box which was super cool. 

I thought the tour was very well organized and very well done. We definitely had so much fun and got to see the park and so many different angles. 

Highly recommend!Drove to Beantown for a midsummer/midweek game versus the Rays. My anticipation was bursting with my inner child's enthusiasm for the Cathedral of Baseball!

It did not disappoint, it actually exceeded my lofty expectations. We excitedly entered at a gate that was the farthest from our section. No worries. This afforded us the opportunity to explore all of Fenway. I experienced sensory overload with all of the heavenly food smells, and sounds of vendors, and sights of the tributes to Redsox from near and far. Foxx, Williams, Yaz, Lynn, Rice, Clemens, Pedro, Big Papi. Awesome! 

We settled in to our seats in Section 32, Row 4, adjacent to the Monster. Perfectly shaded view down the 1st base side in a Non alcoholic section (unintentional). Enjoyed chatting with our Usher, aka Eagle eye, and fans around us. One of the fans was kind enough to give us detailed directions back to our parked car. Thanks Dave. All in all, a memorable day! Even if you are'nt a Redsox fan ( I am a sillies fan) check them out!2nd time doing the fenway tour. This time they were setting up for a concert. We did a different route in the building this time, so got to see a different route. 
The bonus this tour, got to see the world series trophies    
Tour is an hour long. Wheelchair and stroller accessible.
We had a great day today at our first ever ballgame at Fenway.  The game was close, there were plenty of fun diversions and security presence kept everyone being nice to each other :)

Lots of kids enjoying this summer day and loved that the players handed out so many balls after practice.  

I did take a few pictures of menus inside the park as I was really curious what food was going to cost us; so hopefully this is helpful.  We did see a plant based cheeseburger offering and several gluten free bun signs as well.  Most people had dogs, pizza or chicken tenders.  

There are plenty more options outside the park on Jersey and the surrounding streets if you prefer either a food cart or a sit down restaurant or bar.
Took the Worcester Line from South Station to Lansdowne Station and walked right up to Fenway.  Made the mistake of getting a sausage inside rather than the carts on Yawkey Way (didn't look near as good) but we had great seats. It was picture day so we got to go down on the field, get some pics with the players and the green monster. Seventh inning stretch, Sweet Caroline in the eighth, and the Red Sox won!! A great day all around!Driving in from Maine, I asked my wife if the Red Sox were in town for the evening and after she saw that they were playing the Yankees, I knew my son and I needed to experience a game at Fenway Park!

I absolutely loved every moment of this experience especially coming from Dodger Stadium and going to Dodger games. Dodger fans are passionate but are out done by Red Sox fans!  I love the quaintness of this ballpark, the fans were amazing, and the history of this place speaks for itself.

We were sitting in grandstand 12 row four which had a great view and no pillar in front of it. We were lucky that the Red Sox beat the Yankees so the crowd was extremely excited especially because the Red Sox came from behind to win the game.

I highly recommend anybody to watch the game at this great ballpark. I hope it's here for generations to come! Please don't change a thing!There are a lot of reasons people could argue that Fenway Park does not "deserve" a 5-star rating: uncomfortable grandstand seats that sometimes seem like they face the wrong direction, poorly placed poles that block your view, overpriced beer and mediocre food, etc. But, there is simply no better environment to enjoy a MLB game. The stadium is intimate, the crowd is electric, the talent on the field is usually top notch, the neighborhood is delightful pre- and post-game. If you've been to Fenway, you'll likely return at every chance you get. If you haven't been, it's a must experience when in Boston.
Amazing venue for a concert! Aerosmith 50th anniversary tour was EPIC! Will definitely be back to Fenway for future concerts.
Came here for the Fenway Park tour and learned so much about the park. I'm not a baseball person but I enjoyed the tour. I would recommend the tour especially if you're a baseball fan. It's a great stadium but the seats aren't super comfortable so can't imagine sitting through a whole game here.
I live in Toronto, it has a horrendous ballpark (SKYDOME), often listed in the top 2 worst of MLB's baseball park cities.  So out of 30 being late ain't great!
I should add I like checking out baseball parks, but find the game tortuously slow and boring.  
Fenway was amazing.  The ambiance, the breeze passing through.  The ability to roam around a bit, see multiple sections and locations.  Modern washroom also nice!  If I lived here, I'd go to a handful of games, a great Boston experience.  I wouldn't stay for nine innings (no chance!), but I'd buy tickets and maybe the sport grows on me... the ballpark experience is so key to MLB.
Two negatives; massive souvenir shop; but not a T-shirt under $40.  And $12 USD for cups of beer.
This was my first time at a baseball stadium so I have nothing to compare this to. It was pretty organized though and the people working there were good at telling us where to go. Since we got there after the game started, there wasn't a line to get in and the security check was very light and easy. 

Food is definitely expensive so I didn't even bother. I had some money loaded into my ticket and it was very difficult to find a place in the stadium that accepted it. Eventually, we found that the larger merchandise store by one of the entrances takes it so we were finally able to use it.
Fenway lives up to the hype!

It was my first time at Fenway (and first time in Boston) and I knew I had to come to Fenway to watch a Redsox game! Not only that, but we also took a tour of the stadium, which I *highly* recommend if you haven't already. We got to go on the field during practice, sit on top of the Green Monster, and listen to the unique history story of Fenway!

The game was amazing, too. In my home state, I rarely ever see the stadium that full on a Monday night. Food is great, beers are cold and service is friendly. We had a really great time and it was honestly such a unique and amazing experience. I can see why so many people recommend coming to a game when you're in Boston! Truly one of the most amazing and memorable games I've been to so far. I wish I lived closer so I could go more often.
Ok, this place needs to train its staff BADLY. It's otherwise a fine historic stadium. 

The First Base Deck Bar had a server who asked "do you want you drink a little strong" and proceeded to make it a double and charge me accordingly? It was a gin and tonic. It was WAY TOO strong. Next time, ask if the person wants a double, flat out. 

Then, I waited in line for the First Base Deck Grill. It was a looong line. The marquee / TV said they had popcorn. When I went to order after waiting in line, she informed me there was no popcorn. I said "oh; your sign says you have popcorn" she said "yeah, well we don't." 

I then went to 5 other stands to find popcorn. Finally did. 

The women's bathroom near grand stand 16 had ceiling panels that were missing for no apparent reason. Big security flaw.
Let me start off by saying as a Boston sports fanatic and former JR high baseball player and huge baseball fan between the years 1998 and 2004, that I find baseball to be INCREDIBLY BORING. I can't remember the last time I watched a regular season game on TV or even a World Series game in the last decade. 

HOWEVER, I've been to Fenway park 5 times this summer. Why? Because Fenway Park is simply amazing. As a Boston sports fanatic I can definitively and objectively say it's the best baseball park in the World (even though I have only been to two) ;)

Especially if you come here on a warm summer evening, the energy can not be matched! 

Also, 90% of seats at Fenway are great and tickets are relatively inexpensive, starting at about $25 to $30 after fees when they're not playing the Yankees. 

Can't beat that! 

BTW, all of the food is overpriced similar to an amusement park or movie theater. 

If you're not into baseball, you come here socialize, grab a beer and hot dog and enjoy the sights and sounds and of course the game.
Sports history in action. I participated in their history tour where they take you to the old seating area and to the green monster. You can still see impressions of the hundreds of balls that have hit it. Oh and and this is where I discovered that the green monster seating isn't part of season tickets. It is first come first serve (just be prepared to pay a premium). Fenway also has partnerships that led to the develop of an urban garden.
Earlier this summer I got to see a game at Wrigley Field and that was a blast! We flew to Boston for 40 hours or so in the middle of a week in Washington DC just for the sole purpose of seeing a Red Sox game at Fenway Park! 

This was a fun and incredibly memorable experience! 

(+) I ended up grabbing some Grandstand seats in the 200 section along the Third Base line. After all fees and taxes, they basically ran about $75 each, out the door. 

They ended up being fantastic seats with a great view of the game, the scoreboard, and an interesting crowd of people around us! lol
(+) We watched an epic 4 hour plus battle between the Blue Jays and Red Sox that ended up being one hell of an entertaining game! The only thing that sucked was that the Jays won 6-5 in 10 innings. Bah. 

What a game though!
(+) We decided to go crazy and treat ourselves to a local Boston treat. We grabbed a couple of Lobster Rolls and a couple of Coke Zeros in Red Sox souvenir cups. This is not a cheap treat. lol You will pay market value for that lobster. We went in the last week of August and ended up paying roughly $35 per lobster roll! lol They do stuff that thing with a LOT of big fat chunks of lobster! So frickin' tasty!
(+) The area of restaurants, bars, and stores surrounding the field was a lot of fun and very lively! Grabbed some great food, souvenirs, and a drink before I even stepped foot in Fenway!
(+) The atmosphere was electric and so much fun! Between the 7th Inning stretch, multiple waves, Sweet Caroline, good old fashioned trash talk, and a near fight 3 rows in front of me, I felt like I was getting a vintage Boston experience! lol

The sounds of the game around my seating area:

Anytime the Red Sox were at bat: LET'S GO RED SOX! LET'S GO RED SOX! LETS'S GO RED SOX! 

Anytime the Blue Jays were at bat: YAH GAHBAGE! STRAIGHT GAHHHBAGE! YOU MUDDAFUCCA! GO BACK TO TORONTAH!

lol The sweet sounds of the game! 
(+) All employees we interacted with were friendly and fun and definitely added to the fun atmosphere. 

The only things I didn't like:
(-) Those hardwood seats are pretty brutal on the backside.....especially when the game goes well over 4 hours long! 
(-) We were staying at a hotel that was literally a 7-minute walk away, but when the game was letting out, they made us walk around the other side of the Ball Park to get there. Douches. Seemed pretty unnecessary. 

Despite those things, this was an incredibly fun and memorable experience! 
The only thing that would have made it better is if the Sox had won! Oh well, I guess you can't have it all. 

Bucket list item: Check! 

5 stars.
A great time at one of the country's most historic ballparks, and I'm not even a baseball fan, ha!

On a recent trip out to Boston, we were on the hunt to tick of all the must-dos and must-sees. Of course, Fenway Park sits on top of the list. My three friends and I attended a Thursday night game, and it was definitely a cool experience. The atmosphere surrounding the stadium is wild. People fill the streets and surrounding bars, good energy everywhere. 

Fenway Park itself, being over 100 years old, certainly has that old-school feel. The idea that this piece of history is still being used today is what makes it so great! Event the seating (though clearly updated since the early 1900s) are still throwback-style. We didn't pay for the greatest seats, yet the views of the game were still fantastic. 

The stadiums layout was easy to navigate, security wasn't tough to get through, the whole place was well-kept and clean, and drink/food prices were absolutely outrageous :) You know you've been to a sporting event when you come back with empty pockets!My husband grew up in the Boston area and RI, so I was excited to experience his love for the game and Fenway.

Our adult kids were geeking out, as it was their first time there, it was great to witness that, as well!

I'm not a baseball fan, but I did enjoy the beer, hot dogs and shopping for souvenirs! :)What's not to love about our beloved Fenway? The sausage carts on the streets, the vendors selling those tee's with the funny sayings. The vendors in the park walking around selling beers and hotdogs. The smell of popcorn and peanuts. They even have my Massachusetts favorite Lord Hobo. It can be a bit pricey but it's a stadium, it's expected. The atmosphere is just relaxing, and you can't help but to be happy there.

Even if you are'nt a Redsox fan ( I am a sillies fan) check them out!2nd time doing the fenway tour. This time they were setting up for a concert. We did a different route in the building this time, so got to see a different route. 
The bonus this tour, got to see the world series trophies    
Tour is an hour long. Wheelchair and stroller accessible.
We had a great day today at our first ever ballgame at Fenway.  The game was close, there were plenty of fun diversions and security presence kept everyone being nice to each other :)

Lots of kids enjoying this summer day and loved that the players handed out so many balls after practice.  

I did take a few pictures of menus inside the park as I was really curious what food was going to cost us; so hopefully this is helpful.  We did see a plant based cheeseburger offering and several gluten free bun signs as well.  Most people had dogs, pizza or chicken tenders.  

There are plenty more options outside the park on Jersey and the surrounding streets if you prefer either a food cart or a sit down restaurant or bar.
Took the Worcester Line from South Station to Lansdowne Station and walked right up to Fenway.  Made the mistake of getting a sausage inside rather than the carts on Yawkey Way (didn't look near as good) but we had great seats. It was picture day so we got to go down on the field, get some pics with the players and the green monster. Seventh inning stretch, Sweet Caroline in the eighth, and the Red Sox won!! A great day all around!Driving in from Maine, I asked my wife if the Red Sox were in town for the evening and after she saw that they were playing the Yankees, I knew my son and I needed to experience a game at Fenway Park!

I absolutely loved every moment of this experience especially coming from Dodger Stadium and going to Dodger games. Dodger fans are passionate but are out done by Red Sox fans!  I love the quaintness of this ballpark, the fans were amazing, and the history of this place speaks for itself.

We were sitting in grandstand 12 row four which had a great view and no pillar in front of it. We were lucky that the Red Sox beat the Yankees so the crowd was extremely excited especially because the Red Sox came from behind to win the game.

I highly recommend anybody to watch the game at this great ballpark. I hope it's here for generations to come! Please don't change a thing!There are a lot of reasons people could argue that Fenway Park does not "deserve" a 5-star rating: uncomfortable grandstand seats that sometimes seem like they face the wrong direction, poorly placed poles that block your view, overpriced beer and mediocre food, etc. But, there is simply no better environment to enjoy a MLB game. The stadium is intimate, the crowd is electric, the talent on the field is usually top notch, the neighborhood is delightful pre- and post-game. If you've been to Fenway, you'll likely return at every chance you get. If you haven't been, it's a must experience when in Boston.
Amazing venue for a concert! Aerosmith 50th anniversary tour was EPIC! Will definitely be back to Fenway for future concerts.
Came here for the Fenway Park tour and learned so much about the park. I'm not a baseball person but I enjoyed the tour. I would recommend the tour especially if you're a baseball fan. It's a great stadium but the seats aren't super comfortable so can't imagine sitting through a whole game here.
I live in Toronto, it has a horrendous ballpark (SKYDOME), often listed in the top 2 worst of MLB's baseball park cities.  So out of 30 being late ain't great!
I should add I like checking out baseball parks, but find the game tortuously slow and boring.  
Fenway was amazing.  The ambiance, the breeze passing through.  The ability to roam around a bit, see multiple sections and locations.  Modern washroom also nice!  If I lived here, I'd go to a handful of games, a great Boston experience.  I wouldn't stay for nine innings (no chance!), but I'd buy tickets and maybe the sport grows on me... the ballpark experience is so key to MLB.
Two negatives; massive souvenir shop; but not a T-shirt under $40.  And $12 USD for cups of beer.
This was my first time at a baseball stadium so I have nothing to compare this to. It was pretty organized though and the people working there were good at telling us where to go. Since we got there after the game started, there wasn't a line to get in and the security check was very light and easy. 

Food is definitely expensive so I didn't even bother. I had some money loaded into my ticket and it was very difficult to find a place in the stadium that accepted it. Eventually, we found that the larger merchandise store by one of the entrances takes it so we were finally able to use it.
Fenway lives up to the hype!

It was my first time at Fenway (and first time in Boston) and I knew I had to come to Fenway to watch a Redsox game! Not only that, but we also took a tour of the stadium, which I *highly* recommend if you haven't already. We got to go on the field during practice, sit on top of the Green Monster, and listen to the unique history story of Fenway!

The game was amazing, too. In my home state, I rarely ever see the stadium that full on a Monday night. Food is great, beers are cold and service is friendly. We had a really great time and it was honestly such a unique and amazing experience. I can see why so many people recommend coming to a game when you're in Boston! Truly one of the most amazing and memorable games I've been to so far. I wish I lived closer so I could go more often.
Ok, this place needs to train its staff BADLY. It's otherwise a fine historic stadium. 

The First Base Deck Bar had a server who asked "do you want you drink a little strong" and proceeded to make it a double and charge me accordingly? It was a gin and tonic. It was WAY TOO strong. Next time, ask if the person wants a double, flat out. 

Then, I waited in line for the First Base Deck Grill. It was a looong line. The marquee / TV said they had popcorn. When I went to order after waiting in line, she informed me there was no popcorn. I said "oh; your sign says you have popcorn" she said "yeah, well we don't." 

I then went to 5 other stands to find popcorn. Finally did. 

The women's bathroom near grand stand 16 had ceiling panels that were missing for no apparent reason. Big security flaw.
Let me start off by saying as a Boston sports fanatic and former JR high baseball player and huge baseball fan between the years 1998 and 2004, that I find baseball to be INCREDIBLY BORING. I can't remember the last time I watched a regular season game on TV or even a World Series game in the last decade. 

HOWEVER, I've been to Fenway park 5 times this summer. Why? Because Fenway Park is simply amazing. As a Boston sports fanatic I can definitively and objectively say it's the best baseball park in the World (even though I have only been to two) ;)

Especially if you come here on a warm summer evening, the energy can not be matched! 

Also, 90% of seats at Fenway are great and tickets are relatively inexpensive, starting at about $25 to $30 after fees when they're not playing the Yankees. 

Can't beat that! 

BTW, all of the food is overpriced similar to an amusement park or movie theater. 

If you're not into baseball, you come here socialize, grab a beer and hot dog and enjoy the sights and sounds and of course the game.
Sports history in action. I participated in their history tour where they take you to the old seating area and to the green monster. You can still see impressions of the hundreds of balls that have hit it. Oh and and this is where I discovered that the green monster seating isn't part of season tickets. It is first come first serve (just be prepared to pay a premium). Fenway also has partnerships that led to the develop of an urban garden.
Earlier this summer I got to see a game at Wrigley Field and that was a blast! We flew to Boston for 40 hours or so in the middle of a week in Washington DC just for the sole purpose of seeing a Red Sox game at Fenway Park! 

This was a fun and incredibly memorable experience! 

(+) I ended up grabbing some Grandstand seats in the 200 section along the Third Base line. After all fees and taxes, they basically ran about $75 each, out the door. 

They ended up being fantastic seats with a great view of the game, the scoreboard, and an interesting crowd of people around us! lol
(+) We watched an epic 4 hour plus battle between the Blue Jays and Red Sox that ended up being one hell of an entertaining game! The only thing that sucked was that the Jays won 6-5 in 10 innings. Bah. 

What a game though!
(+) We decided to go crazy and treat ourselves to a local Boston treat. We grabbed a couple of Lobster Rolls and a couple of Coke Zeros in Red Sox souvenir cups. This is not a cheap treat. lol You will pay market value for that lobster. We went in the last week of August and ended up paying roughly $35 per lobster roll! lol They do stuff that thing with a LOT of big fat chunks of lobster! So frickin' tasty!
(+) The area of restaurants, bars, and stores surrounding the field was a lot of fun and very lively! Grabbed some great food, souvenirs, and a drink before I even stepped foot in Fenway!
(+) The atmosphere was electric and so much fun! Between the 7th Inning stretch, multiple waves, Sweet Caroline, good old fashioned trash talk, and a near fight 3 rows in front of me, I felt like I was getting a vintage Boston experience! lol

The sounds of the game around my seating area:

Anytime the Red Sox were at bat: LET'S GO RED SOX! LET'S GO RED SOX! LETS'S GO RED SOX! 

Anytime the Blue Jays were at bat: YAH GAHBAGE! STRAIGHT GAHHHBAGE! YOU MUDDAFUCCA! GO BACK TO TORONTAH!

lol The sweet sounds of the game! 
(+) All employees we interacted with were friendly and fun and definitely added to the fun atmosphere. 

The only things I didn't like:
(-) Those hardwood seats are pretty brutal on the backside.....especially when the game goes well over 4 hours long! 
(-) We were staying at a hotel that was literally a 7-minute walk away, but when the game was letting out, they made us walk around the other side of the Ball Park to get there. Douches. Seemed pretty unnecessary. 

Despite those things, this was an incredibly fun and memorable experience! 
The only thing that would have made it better is if the Sox had won! Oh well, I guess you can't have it all. 

Bucket list item: Check! 

5 stars.
A great time at one of the country's most historic ballparks, and I'm not even a baseball fan, ha!

On a recent trip out to Boston, we were on the hunt to tick of all the must-dos and must-sees. Of course, Fenway Park sits on top of the list. My three friends and I attended a Thursday night game, and it was definitely a cool experience. The atmosphere surrounding the stadium is wild. People fill the streets and surrounding bars, good energy everywhere. 

Fenway Park itself, being over 100 years old, certainly has that old-school feel. The idea that this piece of history is still being used today is what makes it so great! Event the seating (though clearly updated since the early 1900s) are still throwback-style. We didn't pay for the greatest seats, yet the views of the game were still fantastic. 

The stadiums layout was easy to navigate, security wasn't tough to get through, the whole place was well-kept and clean, and drink/food prices were absolutely outrageous :) You know you've been to a sporting event when you come back with empty pockets!My husband grew up in the Boston area and RI, so I was excited to experience his love for the game and Fenway.

Our adult kids were geeking out, as it was their first time there, it was great to witness that, as well!

I'm not a baseball fan, but I did enjoy the beer, hot dogs and shopping for souvenirs! :)What's not to love about our beloved Fenway? The sausage carts on the streets, the vendors selling those tee's with the funny sayings. The vendors in the park walking around selling beers and hotdogs. The smell of popcorn and peanuts. They even have my Massachusetts favorite Lord Hobo. It can be a bit pricey but it's a stadium, it's expected. The atmosphere is just relaxing, and you can't help but to be happy there.
Ballpark (#18 of 30)*
*Of "current" MLB stadiums.

Fenway is a must as a baseball person. For years, I assumed it would be the final spot on [my friend and I's] MLB park tour. But as it goes, we stopped talking for months and now we have an awkward tension between us... anyway, he went to Fenway on his own, so I guessed I was going without him... anyway... I had the opportunity to come up here with two of my amazing neighbors, both of which are Brewers fans, to go to this weekend's game against the Brewers.

The stadium is a part of history and in a great neighborhood to explore when you are walkabouting in Boston. Compared to its equally as old counterpart, Wrigley, Fenway has the edge. I hesitate to speculate why, since it is a conglomeration of storytelling art school mind wandering and the wikipedia history of every MLB stadium rabbit hole.

The view we had behind the dugout was really nice. The protective netting disrupts the view somewhat; depending on your angle you might have to look right at the bundled 'edge' of the netting. Sometimes balls sneak in through the top part of the net. Free stuff! 

Worth going if: a) Red Sox Fan b) baseball stadium tourer c) history nerd.
What a cool piece of history that's still standing and still being used today.

One of the must do things while in Boston is to do a tour of Fenway park. Luckily the days we were here there was no ball game, so we were able to get in on a tour last minute. It was the last tour of the day and we took a Uber and rushed there and made it just in time.

Our tour guide was awesome and had a lot of great information to share with us regarding the history of the park and some of the key players like Babe Ruth. The whole tour took about an hour and a half. We even got to go into the media box which was super cool. 

I thought the tour was very well organized and very well done. We definitely had so much fun and got to see the park and so many different angles. 

Highly recommend!Drove to Beantown for a midsummer/midweek game versus the Rays. My anticipation was bursting with my inner child's enthusiasm for the Cathedral of Baseball!

It did not disappoint, it actually exceeded my lofty expectations. We excitedly entered at a gate that was the farthest from our section. No worries. This afforded us the opportunity to explore all of Fenway. I experienced sensory overload with all of the heavenly food smells, and sounds of vendors, and sights of the tributes to Redsox from near and far. Foxx, Williams, Yaz, Lynn, Rice, Clemens, Pedro, Big Papi. Awesome!

Please don't change a thing!There are a lot of reasons people could argue that Fenway Park does not "deserve" a 5-star rating: uncomfortable grandstand seats that sometimes seem like they face the wrong direction, poorly placed poles that block your view, overpriced beer and mediocre food, etc. But, there is simply no better environment to enjoy a MLB game. The stadium is intimate, the crowd is electric, the talent on the field is usually top notch, the neighborhood is delightful pre- and post-game. If you've been to Fenway, you'll likely return at every chance you get. If you haven't been, it's a must experience when in Boston.
Amazing venue for a concert! Aerosmith 50th anniversary tour was EPIC! Will definitely be back to Fenway for future concerts.
Came here for the Fenway Park tour and learned so much about the park. I'm not a baseball person but I enjoyed the tour. I would recommend the tour especially if you're a baseball fan. It's a great stadium but the seats aren't super comfortable so can't imagine sitting through a whole game here.
I live in Toronto, it has a horrendous ballpark (SKYDOME), often listed in the top 2 worst of MLB's baseball park cities.  So out of 30 being late ain't great!
I should add I like checking out baseball parks, but find the game tortuously slow and boring.  
Fenway was amazing.  The ambiance, the breeze passing through.  The ability to roam around a bit, see multiple sections and locations.  Modern washroom also nice!  If I lived here, I'd go to a handful of games, a great Boston experience.  I wouldn't stay for nine innings (no chance!), but I'd buy tickets and maybe the sport grows on me... the ballpark experience is so key to MLB.
Two negatives; massive souvenir shop; but not a T-shirt under $40.  And $12 USD for cups of beer.
This was my first time at a baseball stadium so I have nothing to compare this to. It was pretty organized though and the people working there were good at telling us where to go. Since we got there after the game started, there wasn't a line to get in and the security check was very light and easy. 

Food is definitely expensive so I didn't even bother. I had some money loaded into my ticket and it was very difficult to find a place in the stadium that accepted it. Eventually, we found that the larger merchandise store by one of the entrances takes it so we were finally able to use it.
Fenway lives up to the hype!

It was my first time at Fenway (and first time in Boston) and I knew I had to come to Fenway to watch a Redsox game! Not only that, but we also took a tour of the stadium, which I *highly* recommend if you haven't already. We got to go on the field during practice, sit on top of the Green Monster, and listen to the unique history story of Fenway!

The game was amazing, too. In my home state, I rarely ever see the stadium that full on a Monday night. Food is great, beers are cold and service is friendly. We had a really great time and it was honestly such a unique and amazing experience. I can see why so many people recommend coming to a game when you're in Boston! Truly one of the most amazing and memorable games I've been to so far. I wish I lived closer so I could go more often.
Ok, this place needs to train its staff BADLY. It's otherwise a fine historic stadium. 

The First Base Deck Bar had a server who asked "do you want you drink a little strong" and proceeded to make it a double and charge me accordingly? It was a gin and tonic. It was WAY TOO strong. Next time, ask if the person wants a double, flat out. 

Then, I waited in line for the First Base Deck Grill. It was a looong line. The marquee / TV said they had popcorn. When I went to order after waiting in line, she informed me there was no popcorn. I said "oh; your sign says you have popcorn" she said "yeah, well we don't." 

I then went to 5 other stands to find popcorn. Finally did. 

The women's bathroom near grand stand 16 had ceiling panels that were missing for no apparent reason. Big security flaw.
Let me start off by saying as a Boston sports fanatic and former JR high baseball player and huge baseball fan between the years 1998 and 2004, that I find baseball to be INCREDIBLY BORING. I can't remember the last time I watched a regular season game on TV or even a World Series game in the last decade. 

HOWEVER, I've been to Fenway park 5 times this summer. Why? Because Fenway Park is simply amazing. As a Boston sports fanatic I can definitively and objectively say it's the best baseball park in the World (even though I have only been to two) ;)

Especially if you come here on a warm summer evening, the energy can not be matched! 

Also, 90% of seats at Fenway are great and tickets are relatively inexpensive, starting at about $25 to $30 after fees when they're not playing the Yankees. 

Can't beat that! 

BTW, all of the food is overpriced similar to an amusement park or movie theater. 

If you're not into baseball, you come here socialize, grab a beer and hot dog and enjoy the sights and sounds and of course the game.
Sports history in action. I participated in their history tour where they take you to the old seating area and to the green monster. You can still see impressions of the hundreds of balls that have hit it. Oh and and this is where I discovered that the green monster seating isn't part of season tickets. It is first come first serve (just be prepared to pay a premium). Fenway also has partnerships that led to the develop of an urban garden.
Earlier this summer I got to see a game at Wrigley Field and that was a blast! We flew to Boston for 40 hours or so in the middle of a week in Washington DC just for the sole purpose of seeing a Red Sox game at Fenway Park! 

This was a fun and incredibly memorable experience! 

(+) I ended up grabbing some Grandstand seats in the 200 section along the Third Base line. After all fees and taxes, they basically ran about $75 each, out the door. 

They ended up being fantastic seats with a great view of the game, the scoreboard, and an interesting crowd of people around us! lol
(+) We watched an epic 4 hour plus battle between the Blue Jays and Red Sox that ended up being one hell of an entertaining game! The only thing that sucked was that the Jays won 6-5 in 10 innings. Bah. 

What a game though!
(+) We decided to go crazy and treat ourselves to a local Boston treat. We grabbed a couple of Lobster Rolls and a couple of Coke Zeros in Red Sox souvenir cups. This is not a cheap treat. lol You will pay market value for that lobster. We went in the last week of August and ended up paying roughly $35 per lobster roll! lol They do stuff that thing with a LOT of big fat chunks of lobster! So frickin' tasty!
(+) The area of restaurants, bars, and stores surrounding the field was a lot of fun and very lively! Grabbed some great food, souvenirs, and a drink before I even stepped foot in Fenway!
(+) The atmosphere was electric and so much fun! Between the 7th Inning stretch, multiple waves, Sweet Caroline, good old fashioned trash talk, and a near fight 3 rows in front of me, I felt like I was getting a vintage Boston experience! lol

The sounds of the game around my seating area:

Anytime the Red Sox were at bat: LET'S GO RED SOX! LET'S GO RED SOX! LETS'S GO RED SOX! 

Anytime the Blue Jays were at bat: YAH GAHBAGE! STRAIGHT GAHHHBAGE! YOU MUDDAFUCCA! GO BACK TO TORONTAH!

lol The sweet sounds of the game! 
(+) All employees we interacted with were friendly and fun and definitely added to the fun atmosphere. 

The only things I didn't like:
(-) Those hardwood seats are pretty brutal on the backside.....especially when the game goes well over 4 hours long! 
(-) We were staying at a hotel that was literally a 7-minute walk away, but when the game was letting out, they made us walk around the other side of the Ball Park to get there. Douches. Seemed pretty unnecessary. 

Despite those things, this was an incredibly fun and memorable experience! 
The only thing that would have made it better is if the Sox had won! Oh well, I guess you can't have it all. 

Bucket list item: Check! 

5 stars.
A great time at one of the country's most historic ballparks, and I'm not even a baseball fan, ha!

On a recent trip out to Boston, we were on the hunt to tick of all the must-dos and must-sees. Of course, Fenway Park sits on top of the list. My three friends and I attended a Thursday night game, and it was definitely a cool experience. The atmosphere surrounding the stadium is wild. People fill the streets and surrounding bars, good energy everywhere. 

Fenway Park itself, being over 100 years old, certainly has that old-school feel. The idea that this piece of history is still being used today is what makes it so great! Event the seating (though clearly updated since the early 1900s) are still throwback-style. We didn't pay for the greatest seats, yet the views of the game were still fantastic. 

The stadiums layout was easy to navigate, security wasn't tough to get through, the whole place was well-kept and clean, and drink/food prices were absolutely outrageous :) You know you've been to a sporting event when you come back with empty pockets!My husband grew up in the Boston area and RI, so I was excited to experience his love for the game and Fenway.

Our adult kids were geeking out, as it was their first time there, it was great to witness that, as well!

I'm not a baseball fan, but I did enjoy the beer, hot dogs and shopping for souvenirs! :)What's not to love about our beloved Fenway? The sausage carts on the streets, the vendors selling those tee's with the funny sayings. The vendors in the park walking around selling beers and hotdogs. The smell of popcorn and peanuts. They even have my Massachusetts favorite Lord Hobo. It can be a bit pricey but it's a stadium, it's expected. The atmosphere is just relaxing, and you can't help but to be happy there.
Ballpark (#18 of 30)*
*Of "current" MLB stadiums.

Fenway is a must as a baseball person. For years, I assumed it would be the final spot on [my friend and I's] MLB park tour. But as it goes, we stopped talking for months and now we have an awkward tension between us... anyway, he went to Fenway on his own, so I guessed I was going without him... anyway... I had the opportunity to come up here with two of my amazing neighbors, both of which are Brewers fans, to go to this weekend's game against the Brewers.

The stadium is a part of history and in a great neighborhood to explore when you are walkabouting in Boston. Compared to its equally as old counterpart, Wrigley, Fenway has the edge. I hesitate to speculate why, since it is a conglomeration of storytelling art school mind wandering and the wikipedia history of every MLB stadium rabbit hole.

The view we had behind the dugout was really nice. The protective netting disrupts the view somewhat; depending on your angle you might have to look right at the bundled 'edge' of the netting. Sometimes balls sneak in through the top part of the net. Free stuff! 

Worth going if: a) Red Sox Fan b) baseball stadium tourer c) history nerd.
What a cool piece of history that's still standing and still being used today.

One of the must do things while in Boston is to do a tour of Fenway park. Luckily the days we were here there was no ball game, so we were able to get in on a tour last minute. It was the last tour of the day and we took a Uber and rushed there and made it just in time.

Our tour guide was awesome and had a lot of great information to share with us regarding the history of the park and some of the key players like Babe Ruth. The whole tour took about an hour and a half. We even got to go into the media box which was super cool. 

I thought the tour was very well organized and very well done. We definitely had so much fun and got to see the park and so many different angles. 

Highly recommend!Drove to Beantown for a midsummer/midweek game versus the Rays. My anticipation was bursting with my inner child's enthusiasm for the Cathedral of Baseball!

It did not disappoint, it actually exceeded my lofty expectations. We excitedly entered at a gate that was the farthest from our section. No worries. This afforded us the opportunity to explore all of Fenway. I experienced sensory overload with all of the heavenly food smells, and sounds of vendors, and sights of the tributes to Redsox from near and far. Foxx, Williams, Yaz, Lynn, Rice, Clemens, Pedro, Big Papi. Awesome! 

We settled in to our seats in Section 32, Row 4, adjacent to the Monster. Perfectly shaded view down the 1st base side in a Non alcoholic section (unintentional). Enjoyed chatting with our Usher, aka Eagle eye, and fans around us. One of the fans was kind enough to give us detailed directions back to our parked car. Thanks Dave. All in all, a memorable day! Even if you are'nt a Redsox fan ( I am a sillies fan) check them out!2nd time doing the fenway tour. This time they were setting up for a concert. We did a different route in the building this time, so got to see a different route. 
The bonus this tour, got to see the world series trophies    
Tour is an hour long. Wheelchair and stroller accessible.
We had a great day today at our first ever ballgame at Fenway.  The game was close, there were plenty of fun diversions and security presence kept everyone being nice to each other :)

Lots of kids enjoying this summer day and loved that the players handed out so many balls after practice.  

I did take a few pictures of menus inside the park as I was really curious what food was going to cost us; so hopefully this is helpful.  We did see a plant based cheeseburger offering and several gluten free bun signs as well.  Most people had dogs, pizza or chicken tenders.  

There are plenty more options outside the park on Jersey and the surrounding streets if you prefer either a food cart or a sit down restaurant or bar.
Took the Worcester Line from South Station to Lansdowne Station and walked right up to Fenway.  Made the mistake of getting a sausage inside rather than the carts on Yawkey Way (didn't look near as good) but we had great seats. It was picture day so we got to go down on the field, get some pics with the players and the green monster. Seventh inning stretch, Sweet Caroline in the eighth, and the Red Sox won!! A great day all around!Driving in from Maine, I asked my wife if the Red Sox were in town for the evening and after she saw that they were playing the Yankees, I knew my son and I needed to experience a game at Fenway Park!

I absolutely loved every moment of this experience especially coming from Dodger Stadium and going to Dodger games. Dodger fans are passionate but are out done by Red Sox fans!  I love the quaintness of this ballpark, the fans were amazing, and the history of this place speaks for itself.

We were sitting in grandstand 12 row four which had a great view and no pillar in front of it. We were lucky that the Red Sox beat the Yankees so the crowd was extremely excited especially because the Red Sox came from behind to win the game.

It was my first time at Fenway (and first time in Boston) and I knew I had to come to Fenway to watch a Redsox game! Not only that, but we also took a tour of the stadium, which I *highly* recommend if you haven't already. We got to go on the field during practice, sit on top of the Green Monster, and listen to the unique history story of Fenway!

The game was amazing, too. In my home state, I rarely ever see the stadium that full on a Monday night. Food is great, beers are cold and service is friendly. We had a really great time and it was honestly such a unique and amazing experience. I can see why so many people recommend coming to a game when you're in Boston! Truly one of the most amazing and memorable games I've been to so far. I wish I lived closer so I could go more often.
Ok, this place needs to train its staff BADLY. It's otherwise a fine historic stadium. 

The First Base Deck Bar had a server who asked "do you want you drink a little strong" and proceeded to make it a double and charge me accordingly? It was a gin and tonic. It was WAY TOO strong. Next time, ask if the person wants a double, flat out. 

Then, I waited in line for the First Base Deck Grill. It was a looong line. The marquee / TV said they had popcorn. When I went to order after waiting in line, she informed me there was no popcorn. I said "oh; your sign says you have popcorn" she said "yeah, well we don't." 

I then went to 5 other stands to find popcorn. Finally did. 

The women's bathroom near grand stand 16 had ceiling panels that were missing for no apparent reason. Big security flaw.
Let me start off by saying as a Boston sports fanatic and former JR high baseball player and huge baseball fan between the years 1998 and 2004, that I find baseball to be INCREDIBLY BORING. I can't remember the last time I watched a regular season game on TV or even a World Series game in the last decade. 

HOWEVER, I've been to Fenway park 5 times this summer. Why? Because Fenway Park is simply amazing. As a Boston sports fanatic I can definitively and objectively say it's the best baseball park in the World (even though I have only been to two) ;)

Especially if you come here on a warm summer evening, the energy can not be matched! 

Also, 90% of seats at Fenway are great and tickets are relatively inexpensive, starting at about $25 to $30 after fees when they're not playing the Yankees. 

Can't beat that! 

BTW, all of the food is overpriced similar to an amusement park or movie theater. 

If you're not into baseball, you come here socialize, grab a beer and hot dog and enjoy the sights and sounds and of course the game.
Sports history in action. I participated in their history tour where they take you to the old seating area and to the green monster. You can still see impressions of the hundreds of balls that have hit it. Oh and and this is where I discovered that the green monster seating isn't part of season tickets. It is first come first serve (just be prepared to pay a premium). Fenway also has partnerships that led to the develop of an urban garden.
Earlier this summer I got to see a game at Wrigley Field and that was a blast! We flew to Boston for 40 hours or so in the middle of a week in Washington DC just for the sole purpose of seeing a Red Sox game at Fenway Park! 

This was a fun and incredibly memorable experience! 

(+) I ended up grabbing some Grandstand seats in the 200 section along the Third Base line. After all fees and taxes, they basically ran about $75 each, out the door. 

They ended up being fantastic seats with a great view of the game, the scoreboard, and an interesting crowd of people around us! lol
(+) We watched an epic 4 hour plus battle between the Blue Jays and Red Sox that ended up being one hell of an entertaining game! The only thing that sucked was that the Jays won 6-5 in 10 innings. Bah. 

What a game though!
(+) We decided to go crazy and treat ourselves to a local Boston treat. We grabbed a couple of Lobster Rolls and a couple of Coke Zeros in Red Sox souvenir cups. This is not a cheap treat. lol You will pay market value for that lobster. We went in the last week of August and ended up paying roughly $35 per lobster roll! lol They do stuff that thing with a LOT of big fat chunks of lobster! So frickin' tasty!
(+) The area of restaurants, bars, and stores surrounding the field was a lot of fun and very lively! Grabbed some great food, souvenirs, and a drink before I even stepped foot in Fenway!
(+) The atmosphere was electric and so much fun! Between the 7th Inning stretch, multiple waves, Sweet Caroline, good old fashioned trash talk, and a near fight 3 rows in front of me, I felt like I was getting a vintage Boston experience! lol

The sounds of the game around my seating area:

Anytime the Red Sox were at bat: LET'S GO RED SOX! LET'S GO RED SOX! LETS'S GO RED SOX! 

Anytime the Blue Jays were at bat: YAH GAHBAGE! STRAIGHT GAHHHBAGE! YOU MUDDAFUCCA! GO BACK TO TORONTAH!

lol The sweet sounds of the game! 
(+) All employees we interacted with were friendly and fun and definitely added to the fun atmosphere. 

The only things I didn't like:
(-) Those hardwood seats are pretty brutal on the backside.....especially when the game goes well over 4 hours long! 
(-) We were staying at a hotel that was literally a 7-minute walk away, but when the game was letting out, they made us walk around the other side of the Ball Park to get there. Douches. Seemed pretty unnecessary. 

Despite those things, this was an incredibly fun and memorable experience! 
The only thing that would have made it better is if the Sox had won! Oh well, I guess you can't have it all. 

Bucket list item: Check! 

5 stars.
A great time at one of the country's most historic ballparks, and I'm not even a baseball fan, ha!

On a recent trip out to Boston, we were on the hunt to tick of all the must-dos and must-sees. Of course, Fenway Park sits on top of the list. My three friends and I attended a Thursday night game, and it was definitely a cool experience. The atmosphere surrounding the stadium is wild. People fill the streets and surrounding bars, good energy everywhere. 

Fenway Park itself, being over 100 years old, certainly has that old-school feel. The idea that this piece of history is still being used today is what makes it so great! Event the seating (though clearly updated since the early 1900s) are still throwback-style. We didn't pay for the greatest seats, yet the views of the game were still fantastic. 

The stadiums layout was easy to navigate, security wasn't tough to get through, the whole place was well-kept and clean, and drink/food prices were absolutely outrageous :) You know you've been to a sporting event when you come back with empty pockets!My husband grew up in the Boston area and RI, so I was excited to experience his love for the game and Fenway.

Our adult kids were geeking out, as it was their first time there, it was great to witness that, as well!

I'm not a baseball fan, but I did enjoy the beer, hot dogs and shopping for souvenirs! :)What's not to love about our beloved Fenway? The sausage carts on the streets, the vendors selling those tee's with the funny sayings. The vendors in the park walking around selling beers and hotdogs. The smell of popcorn and peanuts. They even have my Massachusetts favorite Lord Hobo. It can be a bit pricey but it's a stadium, it's expected. The atmosphere is just relaxing, and you can't help but to be happy there.
Ballpark (#18 of 30)*
*Of "current" MLB stadiums.

Fenway is a must as a baseball person. For years, I assumed it would be the final spot on [my friend and I's] MLB park tour. But as it goes, we stopped talking for months and now we have an awkward tension between us... anyway, he went to Fenway on his own, so I guessed I was going without him... anyway... I had the opportunity to come up here with two of my amazing neighbors, both of which are Brewers fans, to go to this weekend's game against the Brewers.

The stadium is a part of history and in a great neighborhood to explore when you are walkabouting in Boston. Compared to its equally as old counterpart, Wrigley, Fenway has the edge. I hesitate to speculate why, since it is a conglomeration of storytelling art school mind wandering and the wikipedia history of every MLB stadium rabbit hole.

The view we had behind the dugout was really nice. The protective netting disrupts the view somewhat; depending on your angle you might have to look right at the bundled 'edge' of the netting. Sometimes balls sneak in through the top part of the net. Free stuff! 

Worth going if: a) Red Sox Fan b) baseball stadium tourer c) history nerd.
What a cool piece of history that's still standing and still being used today.

One of the must do things while in Boston is to do a tour of Fenway park. Luckily the days we were here there was no ball game, so we were able to get in on a tour last minute. It was the last tour of the day and we took a Uber and rushed there and made it just in time.

Our tour guide was awesome and had a lot of great information to share with us regarding the history of the park and some of the key players like Babe Ruth. The whole tour took about an hour and a half. We even got to go into the media box which was super cool. 

I thought the tour was very well organized and very well done. We definitely had so much fun and got to see the park and so many different angles. 

Highly recommend!Drove to Beantown for a midsummer/midweek game versus the Rays. My anticipation was bursting with my inner child's enthusiasm for the Cathedral of Baseball!

It did not disappoint, it actually exceeded my lofty expectations. We excitedly entered at a gate that was the farthest from our section. No worries. This afforded us the opportunity to explore all of Fenway. I experienced sensory overload with all of the heavenly food smells, and sounds of vendors, and sights of the tributes to Redsox from near and far. Foxx, Williams, Yaz, Lynn, Rice, Clemens, Pedro, Big Papi. Awesome! 

We settled in to our seats in Section 32, Row 4, adjacent to the Monster. Perfectly shaded view down the 1st base side in a Non alcoholic section (unintentional). Enjoyed chatting with our Usher, aka Eagle eye, and fans around us. One of the fans was kind enough to give us detailed directions back to our parked car. Thanks Dave. All in all, a memorable day! Even if you are'nt a Redsox fan ( I am a sillies fan) check them out!2nd time doing the fenway tour. This time they were setting up for a concert. We did a different route in the building this time, so got to see a different route. 
The bonus this tour, got to see the world series trophies    
Tour is an hour long. Wheelchair and stroller accessible.
We had a great day today at our first ever ballgame at Fenway.  The game was close, there were plenty of fun diversions and security presence kept everyone being nice to each other :)

Lots of kids enjoying this summer day and loved that the players handed out so many balls after practice.  

I did take a few pictures of menus inside the park as I was really curious what food was going to cost us; so hopefully this is helpful.  We did see a plant based cheeseburger offering and several gluten free bun signs as well.  Most people had dogs, pizza or chicken tenders.  

There are plenty more options outside the park on Jersey and the surrounding streets if you prefer either a food cart or a sit down restaurant or bar.
Took the Worcester Line from South Station to Lansdowne Station and walked right up to Fenway.  Made the mistake of getting a sausage inside rather than the carts on Yawkey Way (didn't look near as good) but we had great seats. It was picture day so we got to go down on the field, get some pics with the players and the green monster. Seventh inning stretch, Sweet Caroline in the eighth, and the Red Sox won!! A great day all around!Driving in from Maine, I asked my wife if the Red Sox were in town for the evening and after she saw that they were playing the Yankees, I knew my son and I needed to experience a game at Fenway Park!

I absolutely loved every moment of this experience especially coming from Dodger Stadium and going to Dodger games. Dodger fans are passionate but are out done by Red Sox fans!  I love the quaintness of this ballpark, the fans were amazing, and the history of this place speaks for itself.

We were sitting in grandstand 12 row four which had a great view and no pillar in front of it. We were lucky that the Red Sox beat the Yankees so the crowd was extremely excited especially because the Red Sox came from behind to win the game.

I highly recommend anybody to watch the game at this great ballpark. I hope it's here for generations to come! Please don't change a thing!There are a lot of reasons people could argue that Fenway Park does not "deserve" a 5-star rating: uncomfortable grandstand seats that sometimes seem like they face the wrong direction, poorly placed poles that block your view, overpriced beer and mediocre food, etc. But, there is simply no better environment to enjoy a MLB game. The stadium is intimate, the crowd is electric, the talent on the field is usually top notch, the neighborhood is delightful pre- and post-game. If you've been to Fenway, you'll likely return at every chance you get. If you haven't been, it's a must experience when in Boston.
Amazing venue for a concert! Aerosmith 50th anniversary tour was EPIC! Will definitely be back to Fenway for future concerts.
Came here for the Fenway Park tour and learned so much about the park. I'm not a baseball person but I enjoyed the tour. I would recommend the tour especially if you're a baseball fan. It's a great stadium but the seats aren't super comfortable so can't imagine sitting through a whole game here.
I live in Toronto, it has a horrendous ballpark (SKYDOME), often listed in the top 2 worst of MLB's baseball park cities.  So out of 30 being late ain't great!
I should add I like checking out baseball parks, but find the game tortuously slow and boring.  
Fenway was amazing.  The ambiance, the breeze passing through.  The ability to roam around a bit, see multiple sections and locations.  Modern washroom also nice!  If I lived here, I'd go to a handful of games, a great Boston experience.  I wouldn't stay for nine innings (no chance!), but I'd buy tickets and maybe the sport grows on me... the ballpark experience is so key to MLB.
Two negatives; massive souvenir shop; but not a T-shirt under $40.  And $12 USD for cups of beer.
This was my first time at a baseball stadium so I have nothing to compare this to. It was pretty organized though and the people working there were good at telling us where to go. Since we got there after the game started, there wasn't a line to get in and the security check was very light and easy. 

Food is definitely expensive so I didn't even bother. I had some money loaded into my ticket and it was very difficult to find a place in the stadium that accepted it. Eventually, we found that the larger merchandise store by one of the entrances takes it so we were finally able to use it.

BTW, all of the food is overpriced similar to an amusement park or movie theater. 

If you're not into baseball, you come here socialize, grab a beer and hot dog and enjoy the sights and sounds and of course the game.
Sports history in action. I participated in their history tour where they take you to the old seating area and to the green monster. You can still see impressions of the hundreds of balls that have hit it. Oh and and this is where I discovered that the green monster seating isn't part of season tickets. It is first come first serve (just be prepared to pay a premium). Fenway also has partnerships that led to the develop of an urban garden.
Earlier this summer I got to see a game at Wrigley Field and that was a blast! We flew to Boston for 40 hours or so in the middle of a week in Washington DC just for the sole purpose of seeing a Red Sox game at Fenway Park! 

This was a fun and incredibly memorable experience! 

(+) I ended up grabbing some Grandstand seats in the 200 section along the Third Base line. After all fees and taxes, they basically ran about $75 each, out the door. 

They ended up being fantastic seats with a great view of the game, the scoreboard, and an interesting crowd of people around us! lol
(+) We watched an epic 4 hour plus battle between the Blue Jays and Red Sox that ended up being one hell of an entertaining game! The only thing that sucked was that the Jays won 6-5 in 10 innings. Bah. 

What a game though!
(+) We decided to go crazy and treat ourselves to a local Boston treat. We grabbed a couple of Lobster Rolls and a couple of Coke Zeros in Red Sox souvenir cups. This is not a cheap treat. lol You will pay market value for that lobster. We went in the last week of August and ended up paying roughly $35 per lobster roll! lol They do stuff that thing with a LOT of big fat chunks of lobster! So frickin' tasty!
(+) The area of restaurants, bars, and stores surrounding the field was a lot of fun and very lively! Grabbed some great food, souvenirs, and a drink before I even stepped foot in Fenway!
(+) The atmosphere was electric and so much fun! Between the 7th Inning stretch, multiple waves, Sweet Caroline, good old fashioned trash talk, and a near fight 3 rows in front of me, I felt like I was getting a vintage Boston experience! lol

The sounds of the game around my seating area:

Anytime the Red Sox were at bat: LET'S GO RED SOX! LET'S GO RED SOX! LETS'S GO RED SOX! 

Anytime the Blue Jays were at bat: YAH GAHBAGE! STRAIGHT GAHHHBAGE! YOU MUDDAFUCCA! GO BACK TO TORONTAH!

lol The sweet sounds of the game! 
(+) All employees we interacted with were friendly and fun and definitely added to the fun atmosphere. 

The only things I didn't like:
(-) Those hardwood seats are pretty brutal on the backside.....especially when the game goes well over 4 hours long! 
(-) We were staying at a hotel that was literally a 7-minute walk away, but when the game was letting out, they made us walk around the other side of the Ball Park to get there. Douches. Seemed pretty unnecessary. 

Despite those things, this was an incredibly fun and memorable experience! 
The only thing that would have made it better is if the Sox had won! Oh well, I guess you can't have it all. 

Bucket list item: Check! 

5 stars.
A great time at one of the country's most historic ballparks, and I'm not even a baseball fan, ha!

On a recent trip out to Boston, we were on the hunt to tick of all the must-dos and must-sees. Of course, Fenway Park sits on top of the list. My three friends and I attended a Thursday night game, and it was definitely a cool experience. The atmosphere surrounding the stadium is wild. People fill the streets and surrounding bars, good energy everywhere. 

Fenway Park itself, being over 100 years old, certainly has that old-school feel. The idea that this piece of history is still being used today is what makes it so great! Event the seating (though clearly updated since the early 1900s) are still throwback-style. We didn't pay for the greatest seats, yet the views of the game were still fantastic. 

The stadiums layout was easy to navigate, security wasn't tough to get through, the whole place was well-kept and clean, and drink/food prices were absolutely outrageous :) You know you've been to a sporting event when you come back with empty pockets!My husband grew up in the Boston area and RI, so I was excited to experience his love for the game and Fenway.

Our adult kids were geeking out, as it was their first time there, it was great to witness that, as well!

I'm not a baseball fan, but I did enjoy the beer, hot dogs and shopping for souvenirs! :)What's not to love about our beloved Fenway? The sausage carts on the streets, the vendors selling those tee's with the funny sayings. The vendors in the park walking around selling beers and hotdogs. The smell of popcorn and peanuts. They even have my Massachusetts favorite Lord Hobo. It can be a bit pricey but it's a stadium, it's expected. The atmosphere is just relaxing, and you can't help but to be happy there.
Ballpark (#18 of 30)*
*Of "current" MLB stadiums.

Fenway is a must as a baseball person. For years, I assumed it would be the final spot on [my friend and I's] MLB park tour. But as it goes, we stopped talking for months and now we have an awkward tension between us... anyway, he went to Fenway on his own, so I guessed I was going without him... anyway... I had the opportunity to come up here with two of my amazing neighbors, both of which are Brewers fans, to go to this weekend's game against the Brewers.

The stadium is a part of history and in a great neighborhood to explore when you are walkabouting in Boston. Compared to its equally as old counterpart, Wrigley, Fenway has the edge. I hesitate to speculate why, since it is a conglomeration of storytelling art school mind wandering and the wikipedia history of every MLB stadium rabbit hole.

The view we had behind the dugout was really nice. The protective netting disrupts the view somewhat; depending on your angle you might have to look right at the bundled 'edge' of the netting. Sometimes balls sneak in through the top part of the net. Free stuff! 

Worth going if: a) Red Sox Fan b) baseball stadium tourer c) history nerd.
What a cool piece of history that's still standing and still being used today.

One of the must do things while in Boston is to do a tour of Fenway park. Luckily the days we were here there was no ball game, so we were able to get in on a tour last minute. It was the last tour of the day and we took a Uber and rushed there and made it just in time.

Our tour guide was awesome and had a lot of great information to share with us regarding the history of the park and some of the key players like Babe Ruth. The whole tour took about an hour and a half. We even got to go into the media box which was super cool. 

I thought the tour was very well organized and very well done. We definitely had so much fun and got to see the park and so many different angles. 

Highly recommend!Drove to Beantown for a midsummer/midweek game versus the Rays. My anticipation was bursting with my inner child's enthusiasm for the Cathedral of Baseball!

It did not disappoint, it actually exceeded my lofty expectations. We excitedly entered at a gate that was the farthest from our section. No worries. This afforded us the opportunity to explore all of Fenway. I experienced sensory overload with all of the heavenly food smells, and sounds of vendors, and sights of the tributes to Redsox from near and far. Foxx, Williams, Yaz, Lynn, Rice, Clemens, Pedro, Big Papi. Awesome! 

We settled in to our seats in Section 32, Row 4, adjacent to the Monster. Perfectly shaded view down the 1st base side in a Non alcoholic section (unintentional). Enjoyed chatting with our Usher, aka Eagle eye, and fans around us. One of the fans was kind enough to give us detailed directions back to our parked car. Thanks Dave. All in all, a memorable day! Even if you are'nt a Redsox fan ( I am a sillies fan) check them out!2nd time doing the fenway tour. This time they were setting up for a concert. We did a different route in the building this time, so got to see a different route. 
The bonus this tour, got to see the world series trophies    
Tour is an hour long. Wheelchair and stroller accessible.
We had a great day today at our first ever ballgame at Fenway.  The game was close, there were plenty of fun diversions and security presence kept everyone being nice to each other :)

Lots of kids enjoying this summer day and loved that the players handed out so many balls after practice.  

I did take a few pictures of menus inside the park as I was really curious what food was going to cost us; so hopefully this is helpful.  We did see a plant based cheeseburger offering and several gluten free bun signs as well.  Most people had dogs, pizza or chicken tenders.  

There are plenty more options outside the park on Jersey and the surrounding streets if you prefer either a food cart or a sit down restaurant or bar.
Took the Worcester Line from South Station to Lansdowne Station and walked right up to Fenway.  Made the mistake of getting a sausage inside rather than the carts on Yawkey Way (didn't look near as good) but we had great seats. It was picture day so we got to go down on the field, get some pics with the players and the green monster. Seventh inning stretch, Sweet Caroline in the eighth, and the Red Sox won!! A great day all around!Driving in from Maine, I asked my wife if the Red Sox were in town for the evening and after she saw that they were playing the Yankees, I knew my son and I needed to experience a game at Fenway Park!

I absolutely loved every moment of this experience especially coming from Dodger Stadium and going to Dodger games. Dodger fans are passionate but are out done by Red Sox fans!  I love the quaintness of this ballpark, the fans were amazing, and the history of this place speaks for itself.

We were sitting in grandstand 12 row four which had a great view and no pillar in front of it. We were lucky that the Red Sox beat the Yankees so the crowd was extremely excited especially because the Red Sox came from behind to win the game.

I highly recommend anybody to watch the game at this great ballpark. I hope it's here for generations to come! Please don't change a thing!There are a lot of reasons people could argue that Fenway Park does not "deserve" a 5-star rating: uncomfortable grandstand seats that sometimes seem like they face the wrong direction, poorly placed poles that block your view, overpriced beer and mediocre food, etc. But, there is simply no better environment to enjoy a MLB game. The stadium is intimate, the crowd is electric, the talent on the field is usually top notch, the neighborhood is delightful pre- and post-game. If you've been to Fenway, you'll likely return at every chance you get. If you haven't been, it's a must experience when in Boston.
Amazing venue for a concert! Aerosmith 50th anniversary tour was EPIC! Will definitely be back to Fenway for future concerts.
Came here for the Fenway Park tour and learned so much about the park. I'm not a baseball person but I enjoyed the tour. I would recommend the tour especially if you're a baseball fan. It's a great stadium but the seats aren't super comfortable so can't imagine sitting through a whole game here.
I live in Toronto, it has a horrendous ballpark (SKYDOME), often listed in the top 2 worst of MLB's baseball park cities.  So out of 30 being late ain't great!
I should add I like checking out baseball parks, but find the game tortuously slow and boring.  
Fenway was amazing.  The ambiance, the breeze passing through.  The ability to roam around a bit, see multiple sections and locations.  Modern washroom also nice!  If I lived here, I'd go to a handful of games, a great Boston experience.  I wouldn't stay for nine innings (no chance!), but I'd buy tickets and maybe the sport grows on me... the ballpark experience is so key to MLB.
Two negatives; massive souvenir shop; but not a T-shirt under $40.  And $12 USD for cups of beer.
This was my first time at a baseball stadium so I have nothing to compare this to. It was pretty organized though and the people working there were good at telling us where to go. Since we got there after the game started, there wasn't a line to get in and the security check was very light and easy. 

Food is definitely expensive so I didn't even bother. I had some money loaded into my ticket and it was very difficult to find a place in the stadium that accepted it. Eventually, we found that the larger merchandise store by one of the entrances takes it so we were finally able to use it.
Fenway lives up to the hype!

It was my first time at Fenway (and first time in Boston) and I knew I had to come to Fenway to watch a Redsox game! Not only that, but we also took a tour of the stadium, which I *highly* recommend if you haven't already. We got to go on the field during practice, sit on top of the Green Monster, and listen to the unique history story of Fenway!

The game was amazing, too. In my home state, I rarely ever see the stadium that full on a Monday night. Food is great, beers are cold and service is friendly. We had a really great time and it was honestly such a unique and amazing experience. I can see why so many people recommend coming to a game when you're in Boston! Truly one of the most amazing and memorable games I've been to so far. I wish I lived closer so I could go more often.
Ok, this place needs to train its staff BADLY. It's otherwise a fine historic stadium. 

The First Base Deck Bar had a server who asked "do you want you drink a little strong" and proceeded to make it a double and charge me accordingly? It was a gin and tonic. It was WAY TOO strong. Next time, ask if the person wants a double, flat out. 

Then, I waited in line for the First Base Deck Grill. It was a looong line. The marquee / TV said they had popcorn. When I went to order after waiting in line, she informed me there was no popcorn. I said "oh; your sign says you have popcorn" she said "yeah, well we don't." 

I then went to 5 other stands to find popcorn. Finally did. 

The women's bathroom near grand stand 16 had ceiling panels that were missing for no apparent reason. Big security flaw.
Let me start off by saying as a Boston sports fanatic and former JR high baseball player and huge baseball fan between the years 1998 and 2004, that I find baseball to be INCREDIBLY BORING. I can't remember the last time I watched a regular season game on TV or even a World Series game in the last decade. 

HOWEVER, I've been to Fenway park 5 times this summer. Why? Because Fenway Park is simply amazing. As a Boston sports fanatic I can definitively and objectively say it's the best baseball park in the World (even though I have only been to two) ;)

Especially if you come here on a warm summer evening, the energy can not be matched! 

Also, 90% of seats at Fenway are great and tickets are relatively inexpensive, starting at about $25 to $30 after fees when they're not playing the Yankees.

(+) All employees we interacted with were friendly and fun and definitely added to the fun atmosphere. 

The only things I didn't like:
(-) Those hardwood seats are pretty brutal on the backside.....especially when the game goes well over 4 hours long! 
(-) We were staying at a hotel that was literally a 7-minute walk away, but when the game was letting out, they made us walk around the other side of the Ball Park to get there. Douches. Seemed pretty unnecessary. 

Despite those things, this was an incredibly fun and memorable experience! 
The only thing that would have made it better is if the Sox had won! Oh well, I guess you can't have it all. 

Bucket list item: Check! 

5 stars.
A great time at one of the country's most historic ballparks, and I'm not even a baseball fan, ha!

On a recent trip out to Boston, we were on the hunt to tick of all the must-dos and must-sees. Of course, Fenway Park sits on top of the list. My three friends and I attended a Thursday night game, and it was definitely a cool experience. The atmosphere surrounding the stadium is wild. People fill the streets and surrounding bars, good energy everywhere. 

Fenway Park itself, being over 100 years old, certainly has that old-school feel. The idea that this piece of history is still being used today is what makes it so great! Event the seating (though clearly updated since the early 1900s) are still throwback-style. We didn't pay for the greatest seats, yet the views of the game were still fantastic. 

The stadiums layout was easy to navigate, security wasn't tough to get through, the whole place was well-kept and clean, and drink/food prices were absolutely outrageous :) You know you've been to a sporting event when you come back with empty pockets!My husband grew up in the Boston area and RI, so I was excited to experience his love for the game and Fenway.

Our adult kids were geeking out, as it was their first time there, it was great to witness that, as well!

I'm not a baseball fan, but I did enjoy the beer, hot dogs and shopping for souvenirs! :)What's not to love about our beloved Fenway? The sausage carts on the streets, the vendors selling those tee's with the funny sayings. The vendors in the park walking around selling beers and hotdogs. The smell of popcorn and peanuts. They even have my Massachusetts favorite Lord Hobo. It can be a bit pricey but it's a stadium, it's expected. The atmosphere is just relaxing, and you can't help but to be happy there.
Ballpark (#18 of 30)*
*Of "current" MLB stadiums.

Fenway is a must as a baseball person. For years, I assumed it would be the final spot on [my friend and I's] MLB park tour. But as it goes, we stopped talking for months and now we have an awkward tension between us... anyway, he went to Fenway on his own, so I guessed I was going without him... anyway... I had the opportunity to come up here with two of my amazing neighbors, both of which are Brewers fans, to go to this weekend's game against the Brewers.

The stadium is a part of history and in a great neighborhood to explore when you are walkabouting in Boston. Compared to its equally as old counterpart, Wrigley, Fenway has the edge. I hesitate to speculate why, since it is a conglomeration of storytelling art school mind wandering and the wikipedia history of every MLB stadium rabbit hole.

The view we had behind the dugout was really nice. The protective netting disrupts the view somewhat; depending on your angle you might have to look right at the bundled 'edge' of the netting. Sometimes balls sneak in through the top part of the net. Free stuff! 

Worth going if: a) Red Sox Fan b) baseball stadium tourer c) history nerd.
What a cool piece of history that's still standing and still being used today.

One of the must do things while in Boston is to do a tour of Fenway park. Luckily the days we were here there was no ball game, so we were able to get in on a tour last minute. It was the last tour of the day and we took a Uber and rushed there and made it just in time.

Our tour guide was awesome and had a lot of great information to share with us regarding the history of the park and some of the key players like Babe Ruth. The whole tour took about an hour and a half. We even got to go into the media box which was super cool. 

I thought the tour was very well organized and very well done. We definitely had so much fun and got to see the park and so many different angles. 

Highly recommend!Drove to Beantown for a midsummer/midweek game versus the Rays. My anticipation was bursting with my inner child's enthusiasm for the Cathedral of Baseball!

It did not disappoint, it actually exceeded my lofty expectations. We excitedly entered at a gate that was the farthest from our section. No worries. This afforded us the opportunity to explore all of Fenway. I experienced sensory overload with all of the heavenly food smells, and sounds of vendors, and sights of the tributes to Redsox from near and far. Foxx, Williams, Yaz, Lynn, Rice, Clemens, Pedro, Big Papi. Awesome! 

We settled in to our seats in Section 32, Row 4, adjacent to the Monster. Perfectly shaded view down the 1st base side in a Non alcoholic section (unintentional). Enjoyed chatting with our Usher, aka Eagle eye, and fans around us. One of the fans was kind enough to give us detailed directions back to our parked car. Thanks Dave. All in all, a memorable day! Even if you are'nt a Redsox fan ( I am a sillies fan) check them out!2nd time doing the fenway tour. This time they were setting up for a concert. We did a different route in the building this time, so got to see a different route. 
The bonus this tour, got to see the world series trophies    
Tour is an hour long. Wheelchair and stroller accessible.
We had a great day today at our first ever ballgame at Fenway.  The game was close, there were plenty of fun diversions and security presence kept everyone being nice to each other :)

Lots of kids enjoying this summer day and loved that the players handed out so many balls after practice.  

I did take a few pictures of menus inside the park as I was really curious what food was going to cost us; so hopefully this is helpful.  We did see a plant based cheeseburger offering and several gluten free bun signs as well.  Most people had dogs, pizza or chicken tenders.  

There are plenty more options outside the park on Jersey and the surrounding streets if you prefer either a food cart or a sit down restaurant or bar.
Took the Worcester Line from South Station to Lansdowne Station and walked right up to Fenway.  Made the mistake of getting a sausage inside rather than the carts on Yawkey Way (didn't look near as good) but we had great seats. It was picture day so we got to go down on the field, get some pics with the players and the green monster. Seventh inning stretch, Sweet Caroline in the eighth, and the Red Sox won!! A great day all around!Driving in from Maine, I asked my wife if the Red Sox were in town for the evening and after she saw that they were playing the Yankees, I knew my son and I needed to experience a game at Fenway Park!

I absolutely loved every moment of this experience especially coming from Dodger Stadium and going to Dodger games. Dodger fans are passionate but are out done by Red Sox fans!  I love the quaintness of this ballpark, the fans were amazing, and the history of this place speaks for itself.

We were sitting in grandstand 12 row four which had a great view and no pillar in front of it. We were lucky that the Red Sox beat the Yankees so the crowd was extremely excited especially because the Red Sox came from behind to win the game.

I highly recommend anybody to watch the game at this great ballpark. I hope it's here for generations to come! Please don't change a thing!There are a lot of reasons people could argue that Fenway Park does not "deserve" a 5-star rating: uncomfortable grandstand seats that sometimes seem like they face the wrong direction, poorly placed poles that block your view, overpriced beer and mediocre food, etc. But, there is simply no better environment to enjoy a MLB game. The stadium is intimate, the crowd is electric, the talent on the field is usually top notch, the neighborhood is delightful pre- and post-game. If you've been to Fenway, you'll likely return at every chance you get. If you haven't been, it's a must experience when in Boston.
Amazing venue for a concert! Aerosmith 50th anniversary tour was EPIC! Will definitely be back to Fenway for future concerts.
Came here for the Fenway Park tour and learned so much about the park. I'm not a baseball person but I enjoyed the tour. I would recommend the tour especially if you're a baseball fan. It's a great stadium but the seats aren't super comfortable so can't imagine sitting through a whole game here.
I live in Toronto, it has a horrendous ballpark (SKYDOME), often listed in the top 2 worst of MLB's baseball park cities.  So out of 30 being late ain't great!
I should add I like checking out baseball parks, but find the game tortuously slow and boring.  
Fenway was amazing.  The ambiance, the breeze passing through.  The ability to roam around a bit, see multiple sections and locations.  Modern washroom also nice!  If I lived here, I'd go to a handful of games, a great Boston experience.  I wouldn't stay for nine innings (no chance!), but I'd buy tickets and maybe the sport grows on me... the ballpark experience is so key to MLB.
Two negatives; massive souvenir shop; but not a T-shirt under $40.  And $12 USD for cups of beer.
This was my first time at a baseball stadium so I have nothing to compare this to. It was pretty organized though and the people working there were good at telling us where to go. Since we got there after the game started, there wasn't a line to get in and the security check was very light and easy. 

Food is definitely expensive so I didn't even bother. I had some money loaded into my ticket and it was very difficult to find a place in the stadium that accepted it. Eventually, we found that the larger merchandise store by one of the entrances takes it so we were finally able to use it.
Fenway lives up to the hype!

It was my first time at Fenway (and first time in Boston) and I knew I had to come to Fenway to watch a Redsox game! Not only that, but we also took a tour of the stadium, which I *highly* recommend if you haven't already. We got to go on the field during practice, sit on top of the Green Monster, and listen to the unique history story of Fenway!

The game was amazing, too. In my home state, I rarely ever see the stadium that full on a Monday night. Food is great, beers are cold and service is friendly. We had a really great time and it was honestly such a unique and amazing experience. I can see why so many people recommend coming to a game when you're in Boston! Truly one of the most amazing and memorable games I've been to so far. I wish I lived closer so I could go more often.
Ok, this place needs to train its staff BADLY. It's otherwise a fine historic stadium. 

The First Base Deck Bar had a server who asked "do you want you drink a little strong" and proceeded to make it a double and charge me accordingly? It was a gin and tonic. It was WAY TOO strong. Next time, ask if the person wants a double, flat out. 

Then, I waited in line for the First Base Deck Grill. It was a looong line. The marquee / TV said they had popcorn. When I went to order after waiting in line, she informed me there was no popcorn. I said "oh; your sign says you have popcorn" she said "yeah, well we don't." 

I then went to 5 other stands to find popcorn. Finally did. 

The women's bathroom near grand stand 16 had ceiling panels that were missing for no apparent reason. Big security flaw.
Let me start off by saying as a Boston sports fanatic and former JR high baseball player and huge baseball fan between the years 1998 and 2004, that I find baseball to be INCREDIBLY BORING. I can't remember the last time I watched a regular season game on TV or even a World Series game in the last decade. 

HOWEVER, I've been to Fenway park 5 times this summer. Why? Because Fenway Park is simply amazing. As a Boston sports fanatic I can definitively and objectively say it's the best baseball park in the World (even though I have only been to two) ;)

Especially if you come here on a warm summer evening, the energy can not be matched! 

Also, 90% of seats at Fenway are great and tickets are relatively inexpensive, starting at about $25 to $30 after fees when they're not playing the Yankees. 

Can't beat that! 

BTW, all of the food is overpriced similar to an amusement park or movie theater. 

If you're not into baseball, you come here socialize, grab a beer and hot dog and enjoy the sights and sounds and of course the game.
Sports history in action. I participated in their history tour where they take you to the old seating area and to the green monster. You can still see impressions of the hundreds of balls that have hit it. Oh and and this is where I discovered that the green monster seating isn't part of season tickets. It is first come first serve (just be prepared to pay a premium). Fenway also has partnerships that led to the develop of an urban garden.
Earlier this summer I got to see a game at Wrigley Field and that was a blast! We flew to Boston for 40 hours or so in the middle of a week in Washington DC just for the sole purpose of seeing a Red Sox game at Fenway Park! 

This was a fun and incredibly memorable experience! 

(+) I ended up grabbing some Grandstand seats in the 200 section along the Third Base line. After all fees and taxes, they basically ran about $75 each, out the door. 

They ended up being fantastic seats with a great view of the game, the scoreboard, and an interesting crowd of people around us! lol
(+) We watched an epic 4 hour plus battle between the Blue Jays and Red Sox that ended up being one hell of an entertaining game! The only thing that sucked was that the Jays won 6-5 in 10 innings. Bah. 

What a game though!
(+) We decided to go crazy and treat ourselves to a local Boston treat. We grabbed a couple of Lobster Rolls and a couple of Coke Zeros in Red Sox souvenir cups. This is not a cheap treat. lol You will pay market value for that lobster. We went in the last week of August and ended up paying roughly $35 per lobster roll! lol They do stuff that thing with a LOT of big fat chunks of lobster! So frickin' tasty!
(+) The area of restaurants, bars, and stores surrounding the field was a lot of fun and very lively! Grabbed some great food, souvenirs, and a drink before I even stepped foot in Fenway!
(+) The atmosphere was electric and so much fun! Between the 7th Inning stretch, multiple waves, Sweet Caroline, good old fashioned trash talk, and a near fight 3 rows in front of me, I felt like I was getting a vintage Boston experience! lol

The sounds of the game around my seating area:

Anytime the Red Sox were at bat: LET'S GO RED SOX! LET'S GO RED SOX! LETS'S GO RED SOX! 

Anytime the Blue Jays were at bat: YAH GAHBAGE! STRAIGHT GAHHHBAGE! YOU MUDDAFUCCA! GO BACK TO TORONTAH!

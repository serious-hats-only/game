This 16.3-inch Lava Lamp is good, but only after I replaced the bulb with a Philips 45W PAR16 Dimmable Flood Light Bulb 434746 available on Amazon or at Home Depot. (By the way, the lamp is listed on the websites as a Halogen, but the package does not state Halogen on it.) The 40 watt incandescent bulb that comes with it just doesn't provide enough heat to get the wax moving. In fact, I ordered this lamp and it worked for a day, then the wax would just sit in the bottom no matter how many hours it was on. I thought it was defective, so I returned it and Amazon replaced it with a new one. The new one did the same thing as the first one, so I figured that it was not getting enough heat for it to work properly. I tried several bulbs including a 60-watt bulb (which worked well, it just got a little too hot). I finally tried the Philips 45 PAR16 indoor/outdoor flood light and it seems to work well. It does get hot, but I can still hold my fingers on the base without it burning. The glass globe, however, does get a bit too hot to keep my fingers on. But it seems to be fine. I hope this info is helpful to others who may think the lamp doesn't work. I now really like the lamp.I gave it 4 stars because I had to fix the lamp for it to work.

Really looked forward to having a classic lava lamp. Arrived on time tonight. Set it up, put it on a solid stable table in library room. Turned it on to warm up per instructions. Went to dinner in nearby kitchen room. Checked on it several times for next hour or two. Returned for warm up check. Lights off? Overhead room lights revealed clear glass broken. Yellow liquid had spewed out onto library table and rug and an art book. A two inch broken piece of glass had cracked loose. No way to fix. Dangerous..sharp. Thankfully no person or animal was hurt! Our cat was nearby but he was okay. Clean up had to be done immediately and the lava lamp had to be put back in its cardboard shipping box and sealed up and carefully placed in our large garbage bucket for safety. Sad moment for us. Big disappointment. Made in China. Distributed in Massachusetts. Don't know why this glass cracked. Just glad no one was nearby and injured. I think we are not confident now to re-order. It had begun to warm up and making the initial snake like shapes. We really were thrilled to go back to the old days of lava lamps. This is a great disappointment, unusual for Amazon. We handled the project very carefully. We really don't want to run this risk again. We're long time buyers of Amazon and we're sorry to report this dangerous incident; at this point we would just want to have our purchase returned to our account. Don't want to run this risk again. Structurally this product was not able to turn itself "on" without over heating causing its side to explode shooting out its fluids. Good news: just glad no one was hurt. Sad night here.

No complaints, 100% as expected.  Works perfectly when instructions are followed.  I particularly like the silver base as that was the original Lava Lamp color, as was the "Astro" shape.  And I love these particularliquid & wax colors as they remind me of the pyschedilic lamp colors of my childhood .... a super cool look.  Kept one for myself and gave one to myfriend as a birthday gift ..... She was thrilled!  Highly recommend.

—————

Looks great, can take 1 hour or so to heat up the liquid and start the lava flow.

—————

This was a must for my retro game cave. I love it. The lightning is not ideal in my picture but it appears to have 3 colors especially at night. Very cool

—————

Diseño y tamaño bueno

—————

I brought this to my grandson on his birthday and hooked it up plugged it in easily while he was still sleeping. He loves it! Perfect night light for an 11 year old!!!

—————

Same mesmerazation as always

—————

I wanted something to spruce up my gaming setup, THIS lava lamp did the job and so much more. I waited 4-5 hours for it to fully melt and it works just fine. Its worth the price, standing at a roughly 16 inches it's no baby. if your thinking of getting one yourself DO IT

—————

This is such a nice yellow to red and purple liquid lava lamp, easy to setup. My other one, the base needs to be fixed after 30 years. Luv these:))

 Great lava lampThe size is bigger than I thought, I’ll try a smaller size maybe later.Daytime, the color is real cool, just like the video I uploadedBut during the night it kinda goes all red (like the second pic)The lamp heats up a bit when turned onOverall, I like it very much

Heated up and started doing it’s lava lamp thing after about 3 hours. I’m using the light that was in the box, other comments said they needed a bigger bulb. 5/5 would buy again.

—————

Most bad ass lava lmao I ever seen . Sick as a mf

—————

I got the 16.3 original in yellow/purple. Yeah, it has a few tiny white specks on the inside glass, but that doesn't detract from the look or performance. I set mine up under my aquarium in the basement, and made a wooden base to help insulate it from the cold cement floor... still takes 3-4 hours to warm up and get rolling. Not a problem, just gotta turn it on sooner than I want to enjoy it. 70's LOVE!

—————

Got a good one here!

—————

I absolutely love this lava lamp but the lava wasn't flowing as much as I’d like, so as another reviewer suggested, i bought the “Philips 263459 45-watt PAR16 Halogen Dimmable Flood Light Light Bulb” on Amazon to replace the bulb that comes with it. And it works MUCH better. Flows quickly and doesn’t take too long to warm up. A lot more personality and fun to watch. Completely changes the product and doesn’t overheat it either. I’m very happy

—————



 This is my first lava lamp, I love it! Highly recommend! Make sure you leave it running for a few hours, it takes awhile for lava to flow because of how big the size of the lamp is. Takes longer to heat up.

—————



 I read a lot of bad reviews but don't let that get you down. I have one lava lamp that the wax got dry and the water lost color, i've been using it for the last 10 or 15 years. I decided to buy a new one for a change and bought  a bigger one. Best Choice i've made this year. It takes a little longer than expected to get the lava to flow but in my country it's winter so i understand why it takes long.I suffer anxiety attacks from time to time and i get insomnia most of the time, this lamp really helps as a relaxation technic, just to concentrate on the lava flow makes me feel relaxed and comfort, specially when im trying to sleep.POINTS TO TAKE ON COUNTBE PATIENT, lava lamps are not going to magicly function right away, you have to wait between 2 o 6 hours (depending on the size of the lamp, the power of the bulb and the room temperature to make it flow)The colored water is so clear that you can really appreciate the color of the lamp and the movement.JUST ONE THING: i don't know why the top metal thingy does not entirley fit but is not a major problem. I love it.

—————

Like the color and adds a nice glow to the room at night. Super fun retro look. My daughter had been wanting one so glad I got it.

—————

This lamp is absolutely what I had both hoped for AND remembered. The fluid is crystal clear, the color is phenomenal. I have the purple fluid with the yellow lava. The colors are so vibrant!!! They go from bright yellow at the base all the way to a deep pink/red to a deep fushia/violet toward the top of the lamp as the lava move away from the light in the base. I had a hard time falling asleep as a teenager, and 30 years ago I had a Lava Lamp with this color combination on my bed stand. Today, I am enjoying it again! If you want an analogous spectrum which includes yellow, orange, fushia, red, and violet, choose this combination. I think the reason you get so many gradient colors that fall between yellow and purple on the orange side of the color wheel is because you have the complementary base colors of yellow and purple working here.Just be soooo careful and handle the box and the lamp once removed from the box---very delicately. Don't shake it or move the lamp when the lava is flowing or you'll get cloudy fluid or "air bubbles" in the lava. Think of it as "china" that you don't want to break, and give it a permanent home and leave it there (I'm sure having a good UPS delivery person probably makes a difference too!) If this review gets read by the Lava Lamp folks, please consider some additional combinations such as cerulean blue fluid, with yellow/orange lava which will produce colors in the blue-green spectrum (BEAUTIFUL!), or dark blue fluid with lime green lava which would produce colors in the blue/greens that would be GORGEOUS--like the ocean! If you use the lighter colors for the lava, the illumination from the bulb will cause the lava to glow and the gradients to get deeper in color as they move farther away from the light and into the fluid's color---all based on the Tertiary color wheel. CALL ME!!! Yes, I would love to work for you! I will set up a lab in my house and help you work all of this out! haha (I am a graphic designer and a painter who mixes her own colors :) I just LOVE these lamps. They are a real delight to me. I'd love to be the one to mix the color combinations and see what I could bring to life! I've got so many ideas!Linda Nelson, Pixelberrypie.com

So much negative stuff on the Amazon Lava Lamps.  First time purchasing a Lava Lite here and I'm super impressed.  I received this lamp at 10:00 am today.  Globe is clean and clear!  Setup took less than 2 minutes... a bulb, set glob on stand, plug in, turn on, add cap.  This was the first run for the new lamp and it took just over 2 hours to get the flow going.  Lava looks amazing!  Closer to the bottom of the globe the lava looks orange-ish yellow-ish.  As it flows to the top, it becomes more neon RED.  This has such a warming and unique feel to it.Growing up as a boy in the 80's, mom always had the lava lamp on and running.  This is the size of lamp she had, and I have always wanted one like it.  I have 3 other lamps; two 14-inch globe, and a 19 year old 17-inch globe (which started my collection in 1998).  I have read that after around 2007 or so, the lamps were manufactured in China.  They don't make um like they used to.  I believe this is correct since my old lamp is going strong for nearly 20 years.  Oh, and mom's lamp was around since around 1978 or so?Pay attention to today's globes and take care of them.  Do not run them excessively (over 8 hours).  Only use the approved/specified bulb. DO NO SHAKE when HOT!  I have had good success so far.  There are also ways to clear up a cloudy globe.  Do a wee bit of research with google to help you if you run into problems!  I will say I was disappointed and returned only 1 globe in the past 20 years, due to excessive bubbles in the lava (the globs looked like swiss cheese there were so many bubbles).Ordering from Amazon was painless.  Very glad I made the choice to select this globe.  I'm into my 4th hour of enjoyment, and I expect many many more.  If things should change, I will edit my review to reflect so.  Thank you for a great items :D

I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas because for some reason, she saw a picture of a lava lamp and really wanted one. Now you could spend up for a Mathmos and go through the trouble to import one in from the UK but I'm telling you you really don't need to. Bottom line is this unit is offered at a nice price, is attractive, and functions exactly as advertised and hoped given the really simple care it requires.First of all, the liquid was crystal clear. The issues with the cloudy salt water seems to have much decreased over the last few years. And liquid and wax colors are quite vibrant. Second, if you give it sufficient time to heat up, it'll work just like you hope.That said, there are a couple of important points to remember.1. Don't shake the bottle at any time, whether the wax is cold and solid or melted and flowing. If you shake it cold, the puck or pieces will leave waxy marks on the inside of the bottle. Shaken hot, you'll make a million little wax droplets. Neither situation is fatal. If you have wax marks, simply wait for the wax to melt then gently tip the bottle over and roll it slowly so the melted wax blob picks up these marks. Give it a moment to do so. If shaken hot, just let the lamp run and in 30 minutes or so, all the small droplets will have coalesced back into the main blob.2. If there is cold wax stuck at the top of the bottle that simply won't get warm enough to melt and combine with the main blob, use a heat gun set at around 70% (same setting you would use to shrink wrap or window film) to warm the bottle wall at the neck near the cap to get it to melt and drip down. Go slowly and be gentle. This will clear every last drop of wax to join with the big blob.I have not tested it running for more than 5 or 6 hours but in that time frame, it is truly delightful. As good as goldfish.

The size was bigger than I thought and much prettier once it started moving.

 After reading the reviews, I was worried about this purchase. Cloudy liquid, bad bulbs, and shipping from the Amazon warehouse can really be hit or miss. It arrived in a box that was 3 feet longer and 1 foot wider than needed, but it was PACKED with brown paper and the Lava Lamp box was wrapped in bubble wrap. So A+ on that. The liquid was not cloudy at all and the video really doesn’t do it justice. I followed the instructions in the box. Put together, allow to heat for about 2 hours, check to make sure the little metal ring is in the bottom. Once I did all that, I shut it down for 1/2 and hour, then powered back on. After about 2 hours it was blooping away. The reviews about how the light bulb sits in the base seem to be correct. It does actually touch the glass of the lamp. It is screwed in completely and I checked the socket to make sure it was connected well and seated. That may be part of the design for better heat transfer, I am not a lava lamp technician. Either way it works amazing, looks awesome, and the way the color changes with the motion is amazing.

—————

I don’t know what all the bad reviews are about,. I love this thing so much I bought another one. It’s like having fish without all the work of having fish. Very soothing. I have one on each side of my computer. The photos don’t do them justice.

—————

My daughter was sooo excited that I thought to get her this psychedelic lava lamp that she thought was the coolest idea ever for her new studio aptmt. on campus, now that she's out of the dorm, because I'm not sure what they allow at the dorm.  I know they don't allow candles, but this is so safe to leave on for days, not kidding.  You have to be patient, it does take several hours to get going, but it does not get overly hot where anyone needs to concern themselves with their children burning down the house with it or at college. I left it on for 2 days, to just see if it got hotter, because I know and you know, your child is not going to use this like a light.  It takes too long to turn on to just shut off, so I just wanted to feel safe with her taking it to her apartment in college, but yeah, this is only 40 watts and the glass to the lava, you could drop on the rug from in the air and it wouldn't break.  It happened to me, accidentally. I panicked, but not a problem.  Not flimsey at all.  Very well made. Extremely safe, as far as I observed for two days with it on the whole time and I could put my entire hand and lay it right on the light and hold it and it did not burn me.  I wouldn't suggest burying it under a bunch of clothes plugged in on the ground of your bedroom floor, either, but up on your night stand, and away from other objects, it truly never even felt more than just warm to me and like I said it was on for 2 full days for me to observe and feel for heat and it's very safe and I'd let it stay in for a couple of days at a time and not feel uncomfortable, but I'm sure the instructions tell you what not to do or do, so I'd follow them, accordingly, don't, necessarily, take my advice.

—————

In case it makes a difference, after reading all these reviews, all I wanted to do was keep it still for a long time after it was shipped, hopefully to recombine anything that may have separated.  It ended up being 3 months.  And I hadn't taken it out of the box first, so I don't know if the fluid was cloudy.  In any case, it works wonderfully and now the fluid is clear.  It's been plugged in about 5 hours now - it took 1 hr. to begin moving and didn't really start flowing well until 3 1/2 hrs.  Very beautiful colors.  Looks great against our cream-colored wall.  I'm so glad I purchased the bigger lamp.  The larger volume allows more flowing shapes and color gradation.  The yellow-orange color, shaded with red, at the bottom really looks like lava and also the cooler reddish-purplish colors at the top.  Very pleased with it.  I hope you have the same experience.  Good luck!UPDATE:  3 months later.  The flow does take a while, couple of times using the lamp and cooling it completely, to get going really well.  But I really liked it then.  Connected flow, very soothing and smooth.  Unfortunately, after a couple of weeks of daily use, the flow separated into the globs seen in the pictures.  So it's not as neat-looking or soothing.  Also, a small piece has permanently split off and always floats to the top, preventing proper temperature flow for it to work best.  I've followed tips posted here to gently twist the COLD lamp back and forth while keeping it firmly on the table so that the circular motion bumps the hard quarter-sized wax back down and where it can heat up with the rest of the wax.  But alas, it doesn't mix back in and as soon as the wax begins flowing again, it floats right back up to the top, covering the surface of the liquid, impeding proper flow.  But it's still a nice lamp and the rest of it is working well..

—————

To all rating this lamp 1 star, you didn’t read your manual. The guy that said his exploded, manual states to leave it at room temp for 8 hours before turning on. Obviously yours was cold from being outside before becoming too hot too quickly. Guy that said his sits up too high, your light bulb must be cross-threaded. People saying your lava won’t flow and buying stronger bulbs, you’re impatient. These big ones take up to 3 hours before good flow. Cloudy? Manual has directions to solve this. I have this one and use the bulb included in the package and it works 100% completely fine. I’ve been enjoying it and it lulls me right to sleep. Absolutely nothing wrong with this lamp or included bulb and the only thing that could make it go wrong is user error. My only complaint is the purple tint on my glass bottle has some tiny pinholes that are only noticeable while up close although, this lamp is plenty big enough to enjoy from a distance so doesn’t bother me. Buy one for every room in your house. They are simple and beautiful.

—————

Guess I got lucky on this. My lamp is clear and the bubbles form and move how they should. I didn't need to change the bulb or anything else. Just plugged it in, waited, and it works great.It does take a few hours, especially the first time. But lava lamps have always taken time to get going. I haven't had to replace the lightbulb, but they are inexpensive and should last awhile anyway. You can get the right bulb at a hardware store or just order online. I would suggest the hardware store however.I don't know the life on these, but I've read they're typically 2000 hour use. You can use them after that of course but it will be cloudy and not work as well. The lightbulbs should last about 1000 hours. So 1 replacement should be all you need and then very likely when it dies you just throw it out. The problem with lava lamps is you have to replace the container, I guess that's a reason they lost popularity.I've liked these since I was a child and I visited my cousin who had one. I couldn't afford one back then and hadn't gotten a chance to get one until now. For me it's nice and relaxing.I would warn on the price however. They should only be $30 for the 16.3 oz. And only $20 for the 14.5. This is regardless of the color combination. It's probably a good idea to just get it off the lavalamp site if there is price gouging here. They should also be available at Walmart and Target.

alrighty......i already have a lava lamp and i have it for about 11 years.  It is a the clear/red lava lamp the classic size and i thought myself i need an upgrade.  check this out and was stunned to see what a great deal this is......20 dollars.  before i purchase this item i read a couple of reviews, and i was pretty worried about it from all the poor reviews.  but what the heck 20 dollars i am going to take a gamble and purchase it anyway.  got the package.  open the package.  crap.  it is cloudy. and there is "lava" stain on the inside of the glass as well.  in addition, it looked like it was all shaken from the shipping.  after couple of seconds of cursing and i was like heck mind as well try it and see what happens rather than returning it straight away.  after couple of days of using it, i like it more and more. The inside stain is gone because the lava melted and the cloudiness SEEMS like it is going away (or maybe i am getting used to it).well for the colors it is frickin awesome...it looks like the sun with the yellow lava and purple background....In the beginning, i was little concern with the gay colors. So, i was planning on purchasing the blue/green one but it cost 7 bucks more.  But, now I am glad I purchase this one.  It is hard to describe but the yellow/purple  create this "sunset" color which makes it very soothing and relaxing.Also, try to purchase this dimmer: Lutron TT-300H-WH with this you can turn it on for 24 hours!!!!!!! because without the dimmer the lava lamp gets too hot and then lava will stop working.  with this dimmer it makes the lamp heat to be in the ideal range so you can leave it on for days..

Perfect

This 16.3-inch Lava Lamp is good, but only after I replaced the bulb with a Philips 45W PAR16 Dimmable Flood Light Bulb 434746 available on Amazon or at Home Depot. (By the way, the lamp is listed on the websites as a Halogen, but the package does not state Halogen on it.) The 40 watt incandescent bulb that comes with it just doesn't provide enough heat to get the wax moving. In fact, I ordered this lamp and it worked for a day, then the wax would just sit in the bottom no matter how many hours it was on. I thought it was defective, so I returned it and Amazon replaced it with a new one. The new one did the same thing as the first one, so I figured that it was not getting enough heat for it to work properly. I tried several bulbs including a 60-watt bulb (which worked well, it just got a little too hot). I finally tried the Philips 45 PAR16 indoor/outdoor flood light and it seems to work well. It does get hot, but I can still hold my fingers on the base without it burning. The glass globe, however, does get a bit too hot to keep my fingers on. But it seems to be fine. I hope this info is helpful to others who may think the lamp doesn't work. I now really like the lamp.I gave it 4 stars because I had to fix the lamp for it to work.

Really looked forward to having a classic lava lamp. Arrived on time tonight. Set it up, put it on a solid stable table in library room. Turned it on to warm up per instructions. Went to dinner in nearby kitchen room. Checked on it several times for next hour or two. Returned for warm up check. Lights off? Overhead room lights revealed clear glass broken. Yellow liquid had spewed out onto library table and rug and an art book. A two inch broken piece of glass had cracked loose. No way to fix. Dangerous..sharp. Thankfully no person or animal was hurt! Our cat was nearby but he was okay. Clean up had to be done immediately and the lava lamp had to be put back in its cardboard shipping box and sealed up and carefully placed in our large garbage bucket for safety. Sad moment for us. Big disappointment. Made in China. Distributed in Massachusetts. Don't know why this glass cracked. Just glad no one was nearby and injured. I think we are not confident now to re-order. It had begun to warm up and making the initial snake like shapes. We really were thrilled to go back to the old days of lava lamps. This is a great disappointment, unusual for Amazon. We handled the project very carefully. We really don't want to run this risk again. We're long time buyers of Amazon and we're sorry to report this dangerous incident; at this point we would just want to have our purchase returned to our account. Don't want to run this risk again. Structurally this product was not able to turn itself "on" without over heating causing its side to explode shooting out its fluids. Good news: just glad no one was hurt. Sad night here.

 Love this lava lamp. The box it was in was in perfect condition. I opened it up, and the stand, bulb, and the lamp were all packed nicely. No dents or cracks. The lamp color is perfectly clear. Was skeptical at first because of the bad reviews but I went ahead and got it anyways and I'm so glad I did. Will update review if anything goes wrong. But overall a great lamp for the price. Thanks again for shipping it.

—————

My daughter loves her new lava lamp and it works great!  Great color (she got the purple one with orange looking lava).  Lava moves well after giving it warm-up time just like the directions state.  Great buy!

—————

I was so disappointed when my lava lamp arrived and it was cloudy. But after running it every day for several months it is slowly beginning to clear up. So, if you have read that there's no cure for a cloudy lava lamp save for a very tedious and complex recharging process that can be found on various places in the web, fear not. It may take a year to be fully restored but it will eventually clear up. It's s cool. I love looking at it and zoning out. It's a testament to the cool that was the 1970s.

—————

It arrived quickly, without cracks or scratches and it works amazing. It was a little foggy at first, but after leaving it on for a while a few times it cleared up. Looks just like the pictures!

I got this to replace a broken jar in another lava lamp, but sadly it was a smidge to big (I tried the regular size already years ago when it first broke).Not a problem though because I figured if it didn't fit the base and cap of that broken lava lamp, I could use it to replace my now gross looking lava lamp (that I originally got as a gift to use the jar to replace said broken jar, but it was way to small ahaha.) So I use it as is and it's great, had no problems with cloudiness and it shows me just how much my old lava lamp's colors have faded. Colors are vibrant and awesome!If you are wondering why I am trying so hard to find a jar to place in an old base and cap, it's a cool one with stars and moons cut out so the light also seeps out and creates a bit of a star and moon field. My grandpa got it for me many years ago, and looking it up it seems to be expensive to get a brand new one (and all I need is the jar). I love lava lamps either way so I figured if I am ever able to replace that jar, then I can have two cool lava lamps.

—————

Lamp is well constructed, with excellent colors and even wax flow. Definitely will recommend snd repurchase.

—————

Ok, so let me start out by saying that I read so many reviews before purchasing this lava lamp (a lot of them negative). Some reviews said lava not flowing, scratches on glass and even bulb no strong enough to heat up lamp. Even after reading all of this I still took a chance and purchased it because of the price and the photos I saw from other reviewers.Let me tell you this was a great purchase. I understand I may be one of the lucky ones, but this lamp arrived without scratches and flows nicely once heated up. To be fully flowing mine takes about and hour and a half and that is just fine with me. In the video it looks more pink than red, but let me assure you that the lava is more RED than pink.I love my purchase and the price was right on. Take a chance you will love it!!

—————

It's great! When I first opened & set it up, all the wax was in a solid lump at the bottom. I was afraid that it had gotten bumped or damaged during shipping. I plugged it in & after 3 & 1/2 hours, it works beautifully! The directions say it may take that long to heat up originally.I also read some reviews & someone gave a long explanation about what people where complaining about & how to overcome those issues. Thanks for the input....uhm.... whoever you were!!!It takes me back to the 70s! I was young & had never owned one, but always liked them. It's very, very mesmerizing to watch!

—————

This product is great! It works perfectly for me and I have encountered no problems. This is also my first experience w/ a Lava Lamp, and I have yet to encounter the problems mentioned in other reviews of this product. So long as you make sure to turn off the product when you aren't using it (best when you're either asleep or out of the house). It can take the lamp about an hour or so to really start floating around once turned on after being shut off for a while. When it's really working it looks BEAUTIFUL. Gives the room a nice yellowy-red glow. Well worth the money IMO.

—————

This is a lovely lava lamp. It warms up within 30 minutes and works as intended. The product is the size advertised. It is a brilliantly rich color at night and turns to red, orange, yellow hughes as the time passes. The only thing I am not digging is the top. It sits on top of the lamp without being secured to the it. The glass is capped with a bottle cap and the lamp lid sits on it, not securely. This is rather displeasing, but it does not effect the utility or appearance as it sits there on the table.

—————
This 16.3-inch Lava Lamp is good, but only after I replaced the bulb with a Philips 45W PAR16 Dimmable Flood Light Bulb 434746 available on Amazon or at Home Depot. (By the way, the lamp is listed on the websites as a Halogen, but the package does not state Halogen on it.) The 40 watt incandescent bulb that comes with it just doesn't provide enough heat to get the wax moving. In fact, I ordered this lamp and it worked for a day, then the wax would just sit in the bottom no matter how many hours it was on. I thought it was defective, so I returned it and Amazon replaced it with a new one. The new one did the same thing as the first one, so I figured that it was not getting enough heat for it to work properly. I tried several bulbs including a 60-watt bulb (which worked well, it just got a little too hot). I finally tried the Philips 45 PAR16 indoor/outdoor flood light and it seems to work well. It does get hot, but I can still hold my fingers on the base without it burning. The glass globe, however, does get a bit too hot to keep my fingers on. But it seems to be fine. I hope this info is helpful to others who may think the lamp doesn't work. I now really like the lamp.I gave it 4 stars because I had to fix the lamp for it to work.

Really looked forward to having a classic lava lamp. Arrived on time tonight. Set it up, put it on a solid stable table in library room. Turned it on to warm up per instructions. Went to dinner in nearby kitchen room. Checked on it several times for next hour or two. Returned for warm up check. Lights off? Overhead room lights revealed clear glass broken. Yellow liquid had spewed out onto library table and rug and an art book. A two inch broken piece of glass had cracked loose. No way to fix. Dangerous..sharp. Thankfully no person or animal was hurt! Our cat was nearby but he was okay. Clean up had to be done immediately and the lava lamp had to be put back in its cardboard shipping box and sealed up and carefully placed in our large garbage bucket for safety. Sad moment for us. Big disappointment. Made in China. Distributed in Massachusetts. Don't know why this glass cracked. Just glad no one was nearby and injured. I think we are not confident now to re-order. It had begun to warm up and making the initial snake like shapes. We really were thrilled to go back to the old days of lava lamps. This is a great disappointment, unusual for Amazon. We handled the project very carefully. We really don't want to run this risk again. We're long time buyers of Amazon and we're sorry to report this dangerous incident; at this point we would just want to have our purchase returned to our account. Don't want to run this risk again. Structurally this product was not able to turn itself "on" without over heating causing its side to explode shooting out its fluids. Good news: just glad no one was hurt. Sad night here.

Brings back my early 70’s and works/looks the same. Cheap Thrills (apologies to Big Brother and the Holding Company & Janis).

—————

I've owned these for a long time and while I do still really pine for the British original (Mathmos) I do like to find more value driven alternatives.  This lamp works great and is what I'd expect.  I have had run ins with models that are ultra cheap and that shows in the quality of the product and how it functions.  This lava lamp provides exactly what I was looking for.  The steady rhythmic motion of the lava.

—————

Remind me of hanging around in the dorm the late 70s on a cold Saturday night with the lava lamp and bong.  However, the wax in the modern units don't flow the same.  Some people say they flow better but I thing the old ones did some more interesting stuff not seen in the new ones.  It would be interesting to compare it to an original.  A must on the bar from here on out.

—————



 I'm totally in love with this lamp, the color combination is awesome. The only suggestion I could give thos is if your keeping this in a colder room it may  stop the wax from flowing the way it should. I keep my space a bit warmer by closing the vents and letting the room get a bit warm considering my room gets colder then other rooms.  So just a fyi for those that have a glob of wax just sitting in their lamps.

—————

I very much enjoy this lava lamp.  As other reviewers have already said, you need to be patient; it takes a while (2-3 hrs) for the lamp to warm up.  Best to turn it on well in advance of when you want to see it working.  Some people have suggested using higher wattage bulbs:  I live in a warmer climate, and haven't found this necessary.  One item I thought worth mentioning: if the bottle doesn't seat completely in the receptacle, make sure the bulb is screwed in as far as it will go.  Naturally, take care not to break the bulb when tightening.

—————

I'm thoroughly satisfied with this lamp. It wasn't too expensive, nor cheap, and is about what you could ask for at around $28 USD.It arrived double boxed, in it's packaging with styrofoam, and a shipping box wrapped tightly around it; Grade A packaging, in other words. I unpackaged it, screwed in the bulb, assembled the 3 pieces and let it warm (or cool when appropriate) to room temperature before turning it on. After only a few hours, it did what it's supposed to, and gave way to a purple/yellow gooey lava show.It never gets too hot, even after many hours, though I'll never go over 12 hours (10 hours is suggested maximum). The switch is about 15 inches down the cord from the lamp and the cord itself is roughly 5 feet long. There is a thin felt pad affixed to the base that allows it to slide with ease but isn't so smooth where it would make it prone to accidents. The glass bottle itself is your standard fare when it comes to lava lamps. It rests in the base on top of the lamp, and can be knocked out and shattered if hit just right. So if you're looking for something safe, look for something else, as this can be knocked out of the base because the bottle isn't secured to anything. It isn't loose however, it seats properly.I would recommend this lamp if you're looking to spend under $30 and don't want to get something really cheap.

—————

This is a great throw-back to the 60s.  This lamp is large and has 3+ blobs going at once!  Great buy.

—————

I was hesitant to get this lamp because of bad reviews, but I gave it a shot. It came in great shape, the purple fluid is very clear, and the wax is up off the bottom, like a pillar. I’m hoping it will turn I to the blobs I remember, but I think it needs a hotter bulb, so I’m gonna try that. I also think I’ll buy another one, I just wish there were more than 2 colors to choose from. I say don’t hesitate, I love mine, and know I’ll like it better once I change the bulb. I took pictures, but there’s no way to capture the deep, beautiful red wax.

—————



 If you have not read the extensive directions online then your lava lamp will not work for you. The coil needs to be on the bottom and the first time you use it and needs to be on for quite a while. I had mine on for 8 hours and it did nothing. But it helps to shut it off and give it a rest and restart it. After that it worked beautifully and we love it!! I posted a picture of it after 8 hours of heating and I thought it was broken. Then I took a video of it after I let it rest for a bit and had turned it back on after I make sure the coil is resting on the bottom. Presto!! It works!

—————



 I never had a Lava Lamp before and I really like this one! So calming and cool to look at…I wouldn’t mind buying another.

I've wanted one of these for ages, and now, I decided I wasn't being silly, I was getting what I wanted. Put some music on and meditate for hours.

—————

Works great and my little girl loves it!!

 This product met all my expectations and then some. I had not one single issue so far. The box was slightly open when I got it but big deal if it works I'm buying a lava lamp not a Rolex. Now as far as the product this is what I noticed. It takes about 7 hrs to really get going on the first use. The base does seem to get a little hot but not enough to cause damage to any surface whatsoever. The top cap is not fixed in place but that is not noticeable when on the lamp. The bottom of the lamp has a nice cloth material to avoid scratching any surfaces. All in all great buy for me would definitely recommend in my personal opinion you will not be disappointed

—————

We purchased a different "lava lamp" for my daughter for Christmas, not knowing it just had glitter in it.  It lasted about 2 months and we sent it back.  This is what we purchased instead and we couldn't be happier.  It is a true lava lamp.  It takes a bit to heat up and get going but that is how they are supposed to be.

—————

This arrived on time and as scheduled.  Packing was just fine with the lamp box enclosed in a larger box with padding.  I opened it up and plugged it in.  The colors are FANTASTIC.  It is purple/yellow but in my environment the liquid is really more of a rich cherry red.  The lava flows from yellow to orange in the middle to brilliant red at the top.  The liquid is completely clear.  I couldn't be happier.  I have a 14" and this one is 16" and SUBSTANTIALLY larger in size - I was surprised.  Both work just fine but the 16" is more like what I remember when I lived in the 60's.  By the way it takes about 2 1/2 hours to go from a cold start to flowing lava.  The light is in my office and ambient temperature is somewhere between 68 and 70 degrees.  Give it time - once it starts to flow it looks great.  I added a photo but it really doesn't do it justice.

—————

this lamp has beautiful colors when working.  the oil is purple and the wax is yellow a little unpleasant when you take it out of the box but  when it is flowing it has purple, yellow, red and orange vibrant colors. its really quite pretty. we had no problems with the wax heating and dispersing as it should.  works well for us.  havent had issues with anything.  it is good sized and sturdy.

—————

Gift for mom in law. She liked it. Hippie?

—————

If you missed the 60s, this nostalgic lamp creates a tiny window into that era.  Its only purpose is to create or enhance the mood and ambiance in a room.  While you certainly won't be reading by its glow, it's fascinating just to watch.  Got to be careful around small children, though, as it can be easily toppled and it gets quite warm to the touch.

—————

I got this as a Christmas gift for my 10 year old son. He loves it. It does get extremely hot to touch (everything -  not just the base or glass). It is really cool and pretty to see it in action. I would recommend as a gift (but not to very young children unless it’s out of their reach).

—————

Buy in KoreaI can not speak English. So I want easy wordsThis lamp is pretty coolEven if some people were disappointed,I have a good productThe light bulb did not break eitherHowever, the water was cloudy when removed from the boxThis problem was solved by leaving the lamp on for a day and leaving it on the spotWhen the lamp is on, the water is clearBut when it was activated, the water was cloudyBelieve that if you repeat this, the water is gradually recoveredIf you have a problem, please check that the power is 110vKorea uses 220v. So, I use transformerAlso, consider replacing the bulbAnyway, almost any problem can be solvedI can not believe that there are so many defective productsOr i seem lucky

Love Love Love this lamp.  The colors are very vivid and stunning. We have several Lava lamps, and this one is my favorite.  I have read a few negative comments on various lava lamps...about them taking too long to get moving.  This is the nature of the lava lamp.  That is the beauty...the slow slow slow melting process and slow, flowing formation of various shapes.  What makes a bad lava lamp, in my opinion, is one that is dull in light.  I bought another one with this purchase, in different colors and size, and it is very, very dark.  You can hardly see any light...like it is not even on.  Will be returning that one.I love the big bowl shape of this lamp.  I have two in this size.  It gives a dark room great mood lighting and what an accent piece.  Compared to my 14-1/2 inch lamps, the 16.3 inchers rock!If this will be your first lava lamp or you are a lava lamp junkie like us, this is the lamp for you!

—————

This lava lamp is HUGE! My son has always wanted one, and now that he is doing virtual school at home because of the pandemic, he really, really wanted one on his desk. This lava lamp should last for YEARS. It is well-made and the wax melts within a few hours, giving him that calming lava effect throughout the day. I love this lamp so much that I want to sit at his desk and work! Definitely recommend.

—————

The Original Lava Lamp is perfect! As per the directions, it took about 3 hours for the 1st time to bubble. Note: when you get it, make sure the wax cap is squarely at the bottom before turning on. My 2nd time took much less time to heat and begin bubbling! It is way cool!  I recommend this to everyone.

—————

Took a gamble here. Bought the purple liquid-yellow wax. Saw a lot of negative reviews but I have nothing but good things to say. My package arrived in perfect condition. No cloudiness or scratches on glass. lava lamp looks awesome, crystal clear. I did buy additional light bulbs just to be on the safe side. I did not test original bulb that came with the lamp but I am sure it works. If you do buy this lamp or any other lamp I would recommend buying the extra, more powerful bulbs anyway. I bought these https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008UDTOBK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_image_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  off Amazon for a good price and they work great. The lamp is up and running in about 40 minutes with these bulbs.

—————

We love our lamp!  It is the purple and red one. I was afraid to buy it because of some pretty bad reviews but ours is perfect. The first time we turned it on it took hours!  It said not to shake it, but after 5 hours of not doing anything, my husband gave it a shake and it let loose and was flowing. We’ve never had a bit of problem with it since. It does take a couple of hours to warm up though. But it has a beautiful glow!

—————

100% works and 100% satisfied. I  Am so perplexed by all the bad reviews and almost didn’t order because of them. My daughter wanted one so bad that I took a leap of faith. It does take 3-4 hours to fully melt the wax and get started but it is so cool watching the process and looks so cool when it is fully going. 😄😄😄My daughter loves it.

—————

I was a little unsure about this product because of the negative reviews from people who said that the liquid was cloudy or the lava didn't flow. But I really wanted a lava lamp, so I went ahead and bought it, figuring I could return it if it didn't work out. I had no problems though. It was delivered on schedule, and I fired it up. The instructions said it would take 2-3 hours to heat up, and sure enough, at the 2 1/2 hour point, the lava flowed beautifully. Glad I bought it!

—————

I chose this size because I had seen a number of reviews that said the smaller versions had issues with the tiny lightbulb not producing enough heat to melt the contents.  I chose the colored liquid variety because of complaints that the "clear" liquid was too murky on arrival and needed to be changed.I'm happy with this purchase.  It does take a very long time for the lamp to get up and running but once it does its beautiful, you just have to be patient.Also, the more you use the lamp, the quicker the wax (or whatever it is) melts.  So if it doesn't seem to be working after 3 or 4 hours don't despair, it will.  And the next time you use it, the better it will work.

—————

My lava lamp arrived within a week and on the exact day that it was "estimated" by amazon (awesome service). It was not really safely wrapped (in my opinion) but it was all good, nothing broken or anything, so they did something right. The set up was supper easy: unwrap everything, screw light bulb (that it comes with) into base, place glass on top, place cap on. I have only had the lamp going for 4 hours (how long your supposed to run it the first time) and I am so happy with it! The "lava" and liquid are the perfect colors (same as the picture) and it flows smoothly. There are air bubbles throughout the "lava", which I actually think adds a cool effect but might go away later, not sure. The only thing that is suspicious is that there are little flakes of almost dirt-like items floating around. Luckily you can only see them if you are really close, so that's okay. Overall I am VERY happy with this product and I would recommend it!

—————

Into every life, a little groovy should fall. This does just the trick. So, light up that spliff, put on that Zeppelin album that’s been collecting dust, and let your mind wander far away from the massive amounts of BS that hovers daily. You won’t be disappointed.

My Grandson loves it

—————

Maybe its the hippy in me, but I have always loved lava lamps. I was pleased to find this one for my daughter. It is so pretty and peaceful looking. It really adds nice color and warmth to her new bedroom.  I love it!

—————

My little girl has been asking for a lava lamp for over a year. So I finally get her one now all her cousin's want one. It takes time to heat up it is normal. Nothing wrong with this one it was a big one and she loves it. I let all the kids know they can not pick it up at any time or touch it. Lo e this item. I might buy more for the rest of the kids

—————

We bought this as a gift but tested it first and it was really cool. We are buying one for ourselves now. Definitely recommend this one if you are considering a lava lamp. The person who received it  as a gift has been using it every day for a week so far and loves it.

—————

I'll be honest, I was a little worried reading through some of the negative comments (I always read the negative comments). Issues with the lava not functioning, the lamp not heating up, etc. But this gift to my 10 year old daughter is outstanding and functions perfectly. Plus, the shipping date projected a delivery time of nearly 4 weeks. It took just over a week!

Decoration in my daughter 6 year old room

—————

We had read a lot of reviews around the quality of the wax and whether it gets ruined during shipping, so we were ready to have to return it if it didn't work. The setup was incredibly easy. It came without any instructions, but it was pretty intuitive to figure out. We had to initially plug it in and leave it on for more than 4 hours before the wax developed it's "lava-like" consistency. We had started to get nervous that the bulb wasn't hot enough to melt all the wax down, and so we put a thermos cozy over it to try and increase the amount of heat. That definitely accelerated the melt. Once it started working though, it was perfect! Looks pretty much exactly like the picture. The colours are gorgeous, the combination of purple, gold and red is fantastic.

—————

Made the mistake of ordering in the winter, was delivered frozen solid. Thawed it in cold water slowly, works great, looks alright( a little foggy but clears up as it warms up) other than that the product is grdat.

—————

All the poor reviews and changing of lightbulb make no sense.  Mine worked perfect day one.  Gorgeous and great quality right out of the box.  Took about 4 hours for first warm up just like the instructions stated.  A must buy!

I don’t know why there’s so many negative reviews about this lava lamp—it works great and flows wonderfully. It takes a while for it to get started but I don’t have any problems with it and it looks awesome. Would definitely recommend.

This 16.3-inch Lava Lamp is good, but only after I replaced the bulb with a Philips 45W PAR16 Dimmable Flood Light Bulb 434746 available on Amazon or at Home Depot. (By the way, the lamp is listed on the websites as a Halogen, but the package does not state Halogen on it.) The 40 watt incandescent bulb that comes with it just doesn't provide enough heat to get the wax moving. In fact, I ordered this lamp and it worked for a day, then the wax would just sit in the bottom no matter how many hours it was on. I thought it was defective, so I returned it and Amazon replaced it with a new one. The new one did the same thing as the first one, so I figured that it was not getting enough heat for it to work properly. I tried several bulbs including a 60-watt bulb (which worked well, it just got a little too hot). I finally tried the Philips 45 PAR16 indoor/outdoor flood light and it seems to work well. It does get hot, but I can still hold my fingers on the base without it burning. The glass globe, however, does get a bit too hot to keep my fingers on. But it seems to be fine. I hope this info is helpful to others who may think the lamp doesn't work. I now really like the lamp.I gave it 4 stars because I had to fix the lamp for it to work.

Really looked forward to having a classic lava lamp. Arrived on time tonight. Set it up, put it on a solid stable table in library room. Turned it on to warm up per instructions. Went to dinner in nearby kitchen room. Checked on it several times for next hour or two. Returned for warm up check. Lights off? Overhead room lights revealed clear glass broken. Yellow liquid had spewed out onto library table and rug and an art book. A two inch broken piece of glass had cracked loose. No way to fix. Dangerous..sharp. Thankfully no person or animal was hurt! Our cat was nearby but he was okay. Clean up had to be done immediately and the lava lamp had to be put back in its cardboard shipping box and sealed up and carefully placed in our large garbage bucket for safety. Sad moment for us. Big disappointment. Made in China. Distributed in Massachusetts. Don't know why this glass cracked. Just glad no one was nearby and injured. I think we are not confident now to re-order. It had begun to warm up and making the initial snake like shapes. We really were thrilled to go back to the old days of lava lamps. This is a great disappointment, unusual for Amazon. We handled the project very carefully. We really don't want to run this risk again. We're long time buyers of Amazon and we're sorry to report this dangerous incident; at this point we would just want to have our purchase returned to our account. Don't want to run this risk again. Structurally this product was not able to turn itself "on" without over heating causing its side to explode shooting out its fluids. Good news: just glad no one was hurt. Sad night here.

I definitely like this bigger size. We had a smaller size and it didn’t work so I returned it and got the bigger size by mistake. But we are glad we got the bigger size. Very mesmerizing and calming.

—————

My husband mentioned he’d like a lava lamp, so I got him one for Christmas. I didn’t how how much we’d both enjoy it. We put it by our tv so we can see it all the time. It’s entertaining and really fun.

—————



 I was scared to order because of the mixed reviews. Upon hearing that the wax wouldn’t melt in some of the lamps, I bought another bulb with a higher wattage. It was never needed!! I got my lamp and immediately plugged it in. After about 4 hours it was working perfectly (it was very cold from the shipment to my home). It is very pretty and adds a nice ambiance to the room. Would strongly recommend! (Plus now I have an extra back up bulb 😂)

—————

Brings back childhood memories of watching my Grandparents lava lamp. Memorizing, pretty and super cool!

—————

Even being stuck in the mail two days it got to be in one piece and very well wrapped up. My lamp was crystal clear and the lava was on the bottom and still on place. Also the Bulb arrived unbroken and no damage to any of the metal pieces.I do wish the cap on top was more properly sitting on top and not wiggling about but it's a design issue. I know the 14.5 lava lamps the cap sits on top snug proper. Will update if anything changes

—————

I'm not sure why people have trouble with these. I got the 16 inch...it was delivered when it was 34 degrees and sat outside for a couple hours but was working great after put together and plugged in within 3 hours.

—————

Go big or go home! I absolutely love my lava lamp and the colors are super cool. It’s very sturdy and will last you a long time if you treat it with love

—————

We love this thing. This one is a bit larger than another one we have. We love them both. It takes them a while to heat up and get going so I turn them on around 4:30 PM so they’re going by 6 or 6:30. While they’re heating up the blobs are pretty weird, not pretty, but once they’re working, they are perfect. Just be patient. They seem to work better as time has gone on. We set ours up and left them without disturbing them and that may be why they work for us. Nostalgia.  Love them.

—————

Has the perfect look of the 60’s!I remember.

—————

this lava lamp actually works as it should.  its pretty and quite active.  a couple of hours after it arrived it was taking us back to our first one years ago.

The Lava Lamp is still Great after all these years! My daughter barely mentioned it for a birthday gift at least 2 months before her actual birthday, so I looked it up on Amazon, and was amazed how inexpensive they were!She was ezstatic  when she opened the box.What a great gift, and it is still performing - all day and night!!

—————

I saw a bunch of complaints that the bulb wasn’t strong enough but that wasn’t the case for me. You just have to be patient and let the lava work itself out. I leave mine on all day and I feel as though a stronger bulb would make is worse. I love this product.

—————

It is as expected.  It was very well packed.  Even though my USPS driver literally threw it on the porch, it wasn't broken.  High five to this seller.

—————

came early  its beatiful

—————

My wife and I love this lava lamp! I purchased one for Valentines day 12 years ago and it was still going strong. The movers slipped and it was broken. I ordered this one and to our delight- it's the EXACT SAME LAVA LAMP we had had.Can't go wrong with this item-I have it on a timer so it starts in the late afternoon giving it time to warm up and motion to start by bedtime.Be patient when it first arrives....give it 5 or 6 hours of on time. After that as the instructions say...give it  2-3 hours to warm up each day.Perfect use for an old "one stage timer".

—————

Lava lamp works 100% as intended! Looks great! Please be aware that it takes HOURS for this to warm up and start moving, but that is NORMAL! Especially on the first handful of uses. The first time out of the box it took 8 hours to warm and start moving, so just be aware of that! Love it!

—————

As a lover of lava lamps for about 50 years, this one is way up there. Excellent quality. I got this for myself after giving one as a gift and seeing it in action. Really nice

—————

I got 2 of these for my mother to gift to my teenaged niece and nephew.  They love them! They were received promptly and they were securely packaged.Would recommend

—————

really cool colors. lamp works just as described. It is used as a night light for my son, who turns it off every morning. So far, it heats up and have great color and movement each time used. The wax is back to solid the next evening and we start the process all over again.

—————

I recently re decorated my living room and have a Bohemian style area rug that is very colorful. This lamp fits right into my new decor. Love it

THIS is the Original! Got another thinking it was the original 3 months ago and the wax failed miserably. This one the wax is much thicker and flows like I remember as a child. It's also larger and wider.If you're looking for the original Lava Lamp, this is it!

—————

This is the best WFH accessory I have purchased since Covid. It calms me throughout the day and also provides warmth to my hands when I am cold!

—————

I love it.  I've never owned one before and was quite excited about it when it arrived.  It takes about 3 hours for it to heat up to a fully active, moving lava lamp and it really shouldn't be run more than 6 hours.  Once it heats up the wax to the point where it starts moving up inside the glass, it becomes more interesting.  It gradually gets more active between the 2nd and 3rd hour of use and then stays very active until it is turned off. It really is mesmerizing and beautiful.  The base does get pretty hot so it should be kept away from kids and pets.

—————

I forgot to read what size it was before I bought it and to my pleasant surprise it was the BIG one.It makes perfect blobs. Takes about an hour to get to perfection.

—————

Our daughter wanted a lava lamp for Christmas. This one was perfect for the what she wanted and it looks pretty great too. Easy to setup. She loves it.

—————

Lovely lamp. Looks good off, on, and fully warmed up. Great addition to my daughter's room. It's both exciting and fun while also calm and mellow.  Groovy baby!

—————

This product works exactly as it should.  Reminds me of the good old days so I have it on a timer that lights it up a few hours a night.

—————

i love this lamp, mine came in perfect condition, the light was perfect, and it warmed up just fine and works as it should! :)

—————

It works and looks just as I expected so far. The instructions say that you need to wait a couple of hours for it to start making interesting patterns, and that's what happened. My kids love looking at it now that it is set up.

—————

I am super satisfied with this product! I’ve been wanting to get a lava lamp for quite some time and I finally decided to order. I was hesitant to get a cheaper one because I was worried it would not work properly but I am extremely pleased with my purchase. This is totally worth the value

I was worried about receiving a "cloudy" lamp but mine worked great. If yours is cloudy warm it up then turn it off and let it sit for 4-6 hours and the particles should sink to the bottom.

—————

I read that people have issues with it hearing. It takes a couple hours but the bulb that comes with it does work. We love the size and the lamp! Would but again for sure

—————

This is a wonderful light and creates a relaxing, nostalgic atmosphere. Doesn't get too hot and I can leave it on for hours. It isn't too heavy so you can put it on small shelves, tables, etc.

—————

Colors are great I wish I could have it on 24/7 lol. But not safe  it doesn’t take long to start glad I purchased it.

—————

Used for glowing pink light in my master bedroom! Lends an gently ebbing flow at night. I love and so do visitors!

—————

Lava lamp is nice but light bulb isnt good

—————

Received this today and set up was a breeze. Made sure the heating coil is flat on the base, plugged in the bulb, and 3 hours later the lava is now moving around!  No air bubbles and looks awesome.

—————

Bought this as a replacement for a smaller, older one. This is the perfect size, not too large not too small. Worked perfectly after warming a couple of hours. Has been on ever since and never disappoints! Love it and will be purchasing more for other rooms.

—————

No issues here! I think the reviews are mixed because it might be a hit or miss. But for me, the bulb fit perfectly, it started working within two hours, and it looks fantastic. Works just like it did in my childhood.

—————

My 8 year-old daughter asked for this for Christmas. We plugged it in, and after about 2 hours, the lava was flowing great. We love it!

This was a birthday gift for my teenage great great grandson.  He lives on the other side of the country and I only see him a couple of times a year so birthday and Christmas presents are important.  Being an old lady the kid is lucky he doesn't get overalls or Indian beaded belts, but I do make an effort and shopping Amazon does make it easy to find things like Lava lamps, which I was told he wanted and didn't have a clue as to what such a thing was or where I would find one, if I knew.  According to his thank you phone call, the Lava Lamp made me the world's best Granny, so I have to tell you it works just fine.

—————

Such a great lamp. Lava rolls into the water perfectly. Yes it's warm and just cool looking.

—————

This is the best! The liquid is actually red, and the bottom glows white to bright yellow, wax turns red as it leaves the bottom.As the lamp warms up the liquid is a ruby read with a yellow/white glow coming from the base. It throws a subtle red glow out about 1 foot. So it looks great even before the 'lava' flows.  This lamp really looks like lava. I liked it so much I wanted to buy another one but the wife put the squash on that. FYI, I tried the clear liquid ones and they look cloudy and I wouldn't recommend them. Also go with the 16in much better than the smaller 14in.

—————

This turned out to be way better than I thought it would be. Appears to be very high quality - my daughter LOVES it.

—————

So many bad reviews but I had no issue . It came in 2 different boxes , bubble wrap. Nothing was damaged , water wasn’t cloudy and it started to fully work in about 2 hours or so.

—————

I bought one in 2016 and when it wouldnt work anymore i bought this one and everyone in my family loves watching it its relaxing

—————

We like this as a peaceful, gentle backdrop. Sometimes we have fun just getting lost in the motions.

—————

I bought this as a gift for my husband, we've had it for two months now, it works perfectly and he loves it! I was nervous, after reading so many negative reviews about it not working right, but ours looks exactly like the picture, the beautiful yellow and pink blobs floating through the purple. I almost bought a clear one for him, since so many reviews said that it was hard to see through the purple, but that's not the case with ours. Just follow the instructions: allow it to warm up and don't run it for more than 8 hours at a time. If it doesn't work, it must be a defective one, so send it back! Beautiful and relaxing to watch.

—————

It stays in very securely, and the warmth is really helping my prostate issues.

—————

I like the different colors and shapes. It is fun to look at!

Good

Three years ago, my 25 year old LavaLamp broke.It was a classic who'stime had come, and owed me nothing. I spent the next 3 years looking for alamp that REALLY worked, and was excited to see that this product was offeredat Amazon, who I pretty much trust explicitly-MY BAD!!!!The product worked for about 8 hours and then died, as other reviews on this sitehave testified. Left with 2 "lumps" of lava that just sit, static. I should have known better when I saw that this item is "Made in China", nuff said.  The problem is that in order to save $$$$, the manufacturer produced heating coils that are way to small to do the job!!!! MADE IN CHINA!!!!! Do yourself a favor. Save some money. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!

—————

Beautiful looks even better in person definitely added to my 70s living room 😍

—————

Brings back memories!  The 16.3" purple/yellow lamp is quite attractive and a very relaxing, interesting addition to the room.  Weather was in the 30's (cold) when the package was delivered to the porch, but the wax warmed and started floating within 3-4 hours.  Perfect night light for the living area.

—————

Bought this lamp for my kid on his birthday and he loves it.  Takes a while (2-3 hours) to heat up fully but then you get TONS of lava going.  Yellow-to-red color transition makes it one of the coolest lava lamps we have ever owned.Great value!  Lamp is much bigger than I thought it would be but was only a few bucks more than we have paid for much smaller lamps.Don't let the bad reviews fool ya!  Every lava lamp gets stuck once in a while.  Just have to take it off the base after it gets good and hot and turn it (keep lamp upright!) gently for about 30 seconds to get the lava going again.  Put it back on the base and you're back in business.

—————

This was a surprise christmas present.  I am really happy with it. very colorful and works beautifully

—————

got this for my boyfriend and he loves it haha its really pretty and just adds some flavor to the room

—————

Exactly as I remembered it - strangely captivating, a great conversatoin piece. Well packed, delivered on time.

—————

My first one arrived empty with a soggy box.... replacement works but is permanently cloudy and I suspect the top is not sealed completely...

—————

It is really cool. Takes about 4 hours to warm up and get going, but once it does the lava moves at just the right rate. The mixture of purple and yellow leads to some cool color changes in the wax. Look at the picture to see what I am talking about. The transition from yellow to red is very calming and fun to watch.Also, this is made out of what seems to be quality materials and is a nice large lamp for the price.

This 16.3-inch Lava Lamp is good, but only after I replaced the bulb with a Philips 45W PAR16 Dimmable Flood Light Bulb 434746 available on Amazon or at Home Depot. (By the way, the lamp is listed on the websites as a Halogen, but the package does not state Halogen on it.) The 40 watt incandescent bulb that comes with it just doesn't provide enough heat to get the wax moving. In fact, I ordered this lamp and it worked for a day, then the wax would just sit in the bottom no matter how many hours it was on. I thought it was defective, so I returned it and Amazon replaced it with a new one. The new one did the same thing as the first one, so I figured that it was not getting enough heat for it to work properly. I tried several bulbs including a 60-watt bulb (which worked well, it just got a little too hot). I finally tried the Philips 45 PAR16 indoor/outdoor flood light and it seems to work well. It does get hot, but I can still hold my fingers on the base without it burning. The glass globe, however, does get a bit too hot to keep my fingers on. But it seems to be fine. I hope this info is helpful to others who may think the lamp doesn't work. I now really like the lamp.I gave it 4 stars because I had to fix the lamp for it to work.

Really looked forward to having a classic lava lamp. Arrived on time tonight. Set it up, put it on a solid stable table in library room. Turned it on to warm up per instructions. Went to dinner in nearby kitchen room. Checked on it several times for next hour or two. Returned for warm up check. Lights off? Overhead room lights revealed clear glass broken. Yellow liquid had spewed out onto library table and rug and an art book. A two inch broken piece of glass had cracked loose. No way to fix. Dangerous..sharp. Thankfully no person or animal was hurt! Our cat was nearby but he was okay. Clean up had to be done immediately and the lava lamp had to be put back in its cardboard shipping box and sealed up and carefully placed in our large garbage bucket for safety. Sad moment for us. Big disappointment. Made in China. Distributed in Massachusetts. Don't know why this glass cracked. Just glad no one was nearby and injured. I think we are not confident now to re-order. It had begun to warm up and making the initial snake like shapes. We really were thrilled to go back to the old days of lava lamps. This is a great disappointment, unusual for Amazon. We handled the project very carefully. We really don't want to run this risk again. We're long time buyers of Amazon and we're sorry to report this dangerous incident; at this point we would just want to have our purchase returned to our account. Don't want to run this risk again. Structurally this product was not able to turn itself "on" without over heating causing its side to explode shooting out its fluids. Good news: just glad no one was hurt. Sad night here.

I have never known what the attraction is, but I love watching a lava lamp.  Just don't put it too close to where you watch TV or your attention will be on the lamp and not the TV program.  It takes between 45 minutes to an hour to warm up, but once it gets going, you can't take your eyes off of it.  This one is a medium size lamp, easily visible from anywhere in the room; much better than the small one.  Take a step back in time (60s / 70s) and enjoy a riveting psychedelic experience with this lamp.  Make sure to keep an extra 40W medium base (A15) lightbulb around so the fun will never stop!  I love lava lamps!

—————

I had a older lamp that burnt out and replaced it with this one works great better colors love it

—————

I had one as a child, and I love this one!

—————

As I mentioned, a beautiful color combination with a strong flow of fabulous shapes. Mesmerizing.

—————

Got this for my daughter's dorm room she loves it! She hasn't plugged it in yet but I'm sure it will be nice!

—————

I love this so much it is so trippy to stare at :)

—————

This is a fabulous lava lamp. The colors and clarity are 100% perfect. I know others had concerns with milky liquid but we aren’t seeing it. Love it!!!

—————

Very happy with this lava lamp would buy agan my Grandson . just loves it.

—————

This lamp rocks! It looks just like the picture, only much better (so neon!). I tried to capture the awesomeness with my camera, but couldn't really do it justice. Makes a really nice reddish glow in the room at night. Two things that bug me: 1- takes 3 hours or so to warm up and get flowing, 2- has scratch marks on the glass on the inside that I can't do anything about. Still giving it 5 stars though because it is really awesome - I even bought another one in blue!

—————

First one purchased did not work but Amazon promptly replaced it.

My bfs kid loved it. Took a while to melt but it works fine just be patient takes some time.

—————

Bought for my Granddaughter she loves it. works great

—————

It’s large and the colors are beautiful!Fairly priced too!

—————

Classic lava lamp. Great size. Awesome colors. My daughter loves it and uses it as a nightlight!

—————

Had one of these in the 80’s  got Brocken while moving This one is just like it ,not one of those little skinny ones,unpacked, plugged in. Looks and works great!!!!!

—————

Works as it should with no problems. Nice finish looks very nice

—————

It was just exactly what my grandson wanted!  He loves it!!

—————

I'm very pleased with the quality of this lamp. But only for the red one associated with this review. If you order the blue and yellow lamp be prepared to be disappointed due to cloudiness.

—————

Very nice if you like medium to bigger size lava lamps, makes an aesthetic “blorp” look

—————

I got this, plugged it in, waited a couple hours, and then it looked like a lava lamp. A nice one even. I'm pretty doubtful you can beat it for the price, since it really is a perfectly functional lava lamp with cool looking liquid and lava. It's also A LOT bigger than I was expecting, Pretty sure the 16.3 inches is in reference to just the tube for the liquid. Which is bigger than I figured it would be anyway.Yeah, odds are, if you get one and it doesn't work right, you are being impatient, or you were just unlucky. Easily recommended.

Within 2 hours of plugging it in I was treated to a splendid visual display. I can tell the bulb is going to be a pain to replace but otherwise very satisfied with the lamp. Having read all the other horror stories I was expecting my chances of getting a good lamp on the first try less than 50% so I guess I am one of the lucky ones. The wax was pooled on the side of the lamp due to being shipped laying down but as the lamp heated it settled to the bottom.

—————

Cool lamp, great size, colors blend well, good light.

—————

Takes a while to heat up but it’s fun once it’s going!

—————

Was a little worried when some people said it didn't work but it just took a few hours to heat up the first time like the instructions said. It's going good now and looking groovy. Its bigger than I thought it was going to be.

—————

My grandson loves it! It helps himFall asleep

—————

This was a gift for a niece who loved the colors.  It was easy to assemble and was starting to move within the first hour of being plugged in to start the warming process.

—————

Gave this to my 16 year old for Christmas per his request. Him and his brother(12) share a room and use it as a night light every night. Great product, thank you!

—————

I was leery to purchase due to other reviews stating this was cloudy or non functional.  Mine came without any issues.  It was a gift for my Goddaughter and was a huge hit

—————

Beautiful. Starts as an orange glow at the bottom of the lamp and turns red as it ascends. I've got a few lamps over the years. This is the only one that changes color.

—————

Great product!  Very heavy and stable.  It was a lot bigger than I anticipated.

I am pleased with this purchase. I read the other reviews.. but, dont have any of the issues thathave been mentioned. The price is GREAT ! You cant find lava lamps for twenty bucks at spencers, etc...unless you score on a clearance price. :) The delivery was prompt... no complaints at all. great jobseller and amazon ! The size is large.... the colors are great... we dont have any issues with the "cloudy"water as some others have said. Lava lamps are never perfectly clear... in my experience.we are having an  adult 70's disco party soon... and this is EXATLY what we needed.thank you amazon !~

—————

Love this lamp!I am buying everyone I know a lamp for xmas!

—————

I love this lava lamp

—————

The best lamp ever, great fun watching the lava.

—————

This lava lamp is bigger and better than I expected. I’m very happy with this purchase

—————

its awesome what can u say its a big lava lamp :)

—————

The device works great! We got one from my grandmother as a wedding gift and it broke.  We were so happy to find a new one, and it works great!

—————

Awesome lamp!  Perfect! Read the instructions, they take a couple/few hours to heat up and get going (referring to the negative reviews).  Once it does it's perfect!  I have it set on a timer, from noon to 10pm.

—————

If you are into Lava Lamps, Amazon is the place to purchase one. They have many of different colors and color is of utmost importance to something you will be staring at off and on in your home. This particular lava lamp is beautiful and my family member just loves it. The structure is good, no fear of leakage, the size perfect, and of good quality which all of my purchases (and they've been many) have been. Now, I have another family member who wants one for Christmas only in a different color. This is a great gift for everyone. I highly recommend it.

—————

Buy this... ignore the negative reviews- it is an excellent product.  Very nice looking.  Takes a little bit of time to heat up then the lava moves around quite a lot!

Well packaged and shipped quickly. Very cool lamp.

—————

Loving it

—————

Great lamp

—————

Warm for a room

—————

I received two of these recently. Concerned about some previous reviews about cloudiness, I immediately put both to the test. Both were clear and bright, and flowed nicely within three hours of the initial "break-in melt" The finish on the glass, as always, is slightly flawed - showing that human hand crafted image (although I'm sure they are mostly machine made).Made in US, or Made in China, these lamps are still as fascinating as they were when I got my very first one in... well, let's just say "a very long time ago". Very enjoyable indeed.

—————

This lava lamp is good looking, easy to set up, and works well.  Just follow the instructions and give it a few hours to get warmed up and going.  I personally like the way it gets the attention of kids and starts conversations with guests when they see it!

—————

Love this lamp!

—————

Colors are hypnotizing!

—————

I used to have a lava lamp with clear liquid and purple lava, and it was the smaller size. I lost it in a move or something, and have been wanting to replace it for ages. Of course, I had to go with the original brand, out of loyalty and having a bad experience with a knock-off in the past. I'm sooo glad I got the bigger size, it makes much more impact! And I will never go for the clear liquid again! The colors that this makes as the lava rises and falls are incredible! It looks like a sunrise, and it's so cool!!

—————

I ordered this as a gift for my nephew.  Because some of the reviews said they had trouble with cloudiness and bits floating in the water, etc., I unwrapped it, put it together and turned it on to make sure it worked before giving it as the gift.  It does take about 3 hours to warm up the wax enough to start floating around (to be expected, especially the first time) but after that, it was great.  The colors were as pictured, the liquid was clear and all the pieces arrived in good condition.

Love this larger lava light!

—————

Absolutely love this lamp, great colors and size

—————

It is so cool to watch at night. The colors are cool and it is well-made! The price was a little steep but overall, it was a nice purchase for our bedroom.

—————

I really liked the color combination. This was a gift for one of my grandsons. He was very excited and loved it. Now my other grandson wants one and has asked for the bigger one just like this one. I think it was a success.

—————

What an awesome product.Upsides: looks great, works well if you follow the instructions and are patient, it's the original lava lampDownsides: takes forever to get flowing (2 hours min), the whole lamp get very hot

—————

Absolutely beautiful! I love lava lamps! This one is beautiful!!!

—————

great lava lamp and a cool color.

—————

Love it.

—————

I love this lamp! I've had a few knock off lava lamps but this is the real deal. The colors are vibrant, the yellows/oranges of the lava look really cool contrasted against the purple liquid. The lava flow is really nice too. It does't clump at the top or bottom, it flows up and down very nicely. The quality of this lamp is outstanding.I had zero issues with how it was shipped. The lamp its self comes in a very nice tube packaging that's very well protected.Get this lamp!

Great colors

well got one and it was all cloudy .the second one works and looks great …  thank you ..

—————

It came as advertised-it came when expected and it came without the endorsement of OUR DEAR LEADER and Liar in Chief DJT.

—————

Nice solid lamp. Colors really pop with the red and purple combination. I like the size of this unit compared to others.

—————

Works great once it gets hot enough. Love the combination of purple liquid and yellow wax. Looks like real lava, red orange fading to red as it cools. Well made nice cord good on off switch. I have had it longer than a year and still love it. Always new and interesting at startup then settles into mesmerizing "percolating". Located next to TV to watch during commercials

—————

I had a red lava lamp when I was a kid.  My daughter asked for a lava lamp for Christmas and I didn't see one at Amazon like what I had.  This one had good reviews although some complaints too regarding poor condition/cloudiness on receipt.  Ours arrived in good condition and I like it better than I thought I would, because the yellow "lava" actually looks red when it's moving around the bottle, only yellow when at the bottom.  That gives it a real "lava" look.  Very nice.

—————

I am sending a new review because I don’t feel my original review was fair. Now that the lamp has settled and I have learned it needs to warm up it has been an awesome thing to watch. I love my lamp!

Very please with my Lava Lamp.  Just as described.  None of the problems I read in previous feedback.  Well packaged.  Liquid was clear.  The 'lava' has a nice vivid color.  Bright yellow a the bottom, rich deep red as it floats up.  This is a larger lamp, so it takes awhile for the action to kick in, but once it does its great.  Provides a nice indirect light in my TV room.

—————

Love the colors!

This is the way they USED to be: substantial and very impressive. It's a large volume of wax, but once it gets going, its movement is a bit that of a bouncing ball: it goes up, sheds a ball downward, continues its rise, may shed another, then rises to the top and comes down again. The smaller units begin to shed a multitude of balls at once in a confusing motion, but this one has a steadier motion. Do follow setup instructions carefully: it matters for the good operation of the unit.

This 16.3-inch Lava Lamp is good, but only after I replaced the bulb with a Philips 45W PAR16 Dimmable Flood Light Bulb 434746 available on Amazon or at Home Depot. (By the way, the lamp is listed on the websites as a Halogen, but the package does not state Halogen on it.) The 40 watt incandescent bulb that comes with it just doesn't provide enough heat to get the wax moving. In fact, I ordered this lamp and it worked for a day, then the wax would just sit in the bottom no matter how many hours it was on. I thought it was defective, so I returned it and Amazon replaced it with a new one. The new one did the same thing as the first one, so I figured that it was not getting enough heat for it to work properly. I tried several bulbs including a 60-watt bulb (which worked well, it just got a little too hot). I finally tried the Philips 45 PAR16 indoor/outdoor flood light and it seems to work well. It does get hot, but I can still hold my fingers on the base without it burning. The glass globe, however, does get a bit too hot to keep my fingers on. But it seems to be fine. I hope this info is helpful to others who may think the lamp doesn't work. I now really like the lamp.I gave it 4 stars because I had to fix the lamp for it to work.

Really looked forward to having a classic lava lamp. Arrived on time tonight. Set it up, put it on a solid stable table in library room. Turned it on to warm up per instructions. Went to dinner in nearby kitchen room. Checked on it several times for next hour or two. Returned for warm up check. Lights off? Overhead room lights revealed clear glass broken. Yellow liquid had spewed out onto library table and rug and an art book. A two inch broken piece of glass had cracked loose. No way to fix. Dangerous..sharp. Thankfully no person or animal was hurt! Our cat was nearby but he was okay. Clean up had to be done immediately and the lava lamp had to be put back in its cardboard shipping box and sealed up and carefully placed in our large garbage bucket for safety. Sad moment for us. Big disappointment. Made in China. Distributed in Massachusetts. Don't know why this glass cracked. Just glad no one was nearby and injured. I think we are not confident now to re-order. It had begun to warm up and making the initial snake like shapes. We really were thrilled to go back to the old days of lava lamps. This is a great disappointment, unusual for Amazon. We handled the project very carefully. We really don't want to run this risk again. We're long time buyers of Amazon and we're sorry to report this dangerous incident; at this point we would just want to have our purchase returned to our account. Don't want to run this risk again. Structurally this product was not able to turn itself "on" without over heating causing its side to explode shooting out its fluids. Good news: just glad no one was hurt. Sad night here.

i regret nothing

—————

This is larger than Lava Lamps I’ve owned in the past. As a result, it takes longer than I was used to for it to heat up and get lava-ing. Given that this holds a higher volume of liquid, this was expected.

—————

Very Happy With product

—————

I saw some reviews saying they had to buy a stronger bulb. Mine worked perfect straight from the beginning. It took a few long cycles for the bubbles in the wax to work out but now looks great with no issue

—————

I am crazy about my new lava lamp.  I turn it on everyday after work.  Takes about 2 hrs to get the lava moving around?  The purple liquid & the yellow lava is very pretty together.  Well made & will buy another one with a different color.

—————

Looks great!

—————

Love it!!!! I used it for a 70s party and I love it so much that I now use it in my room everyday

—————

I love this!!! While I don't consider myself a hippy, never have, I just love lava lamps for nightlights. This is a pretty big size - 16", so it gives a lot of different designs and is fun to watch. I am happy I went with the original lava lamp, it is made very well.

—————

I bought it a few months ago and is holding up really well I’ve had some bad experiences with a few past lava lamps but this one has been working very well

—————

I saw this product on one of those how its made TV shows. Being a product of the 60's, I remember these lava lamps well.We sit on our porch, and wait for the bubbles to drop from the top, and crank up some tunes. Go retro and get one.-David Allen

Got this for my 18 yr old twins and the absolutely love it plus it matches the decor of there room

—————

It takes about an hour to warm up, then works for about another hour before forming a big blob that just sits on the bottom. (lava lamp FAQ says it's running too hot if it does this). I tried swapping bulbs with a different garage-sale lamp that works fine. The other lamp still worked great, but mine still forms the blob. - Disappointed. <edit: I just changed my rating from 2 to 5. Turns out I'm an idiot. I didn't run it long enough. After it warms up it works just fine.>

—————

This is like hypnosis...I sleep like a champ falling asleep to it.

—————

This is by far the coolest thing I have ordered on amazon in a very long time. It also makes your room look a lot better. My room looked plane at first but after I bought this lava lamp it looked a lot better. Remember to look at the size, I was expecting it to be a lot smaller than it actually is.

—————

I bought this lava lamp for my 9 year old son.  He likes something on at night to give him some light and he suggested a lava lamp.  I have owned a few lava lamps in my life time, but this is the nicest.  It is a good sized lamp that creates a soft glow of light. I like the unique way that the color shifts as the was floats to the top of the lamp.  Overall I am very pleased with the quality, size and the price.

—————

Even though the bulb was broken when it arrived, once I replaced it, it's been so nice to have on! So relaxing and soothing to quietly listen to music to!

—————

This is my second Lava Lite. One is in the living room and the Yellow/Purple Lava Lite is within arm's reach from my personal computer. I use it often and really like it. It is soothing, relazing and nostalgic. The colors are beautiful. It came promptly and extremely well packaged in a cylindrical heavy duty cardboard container and placed in a shipping box with lots of crushed paper for protection. If a a Lava Lite is something you would like to have, My recommendation is a five star rating. Gene N. Limon

Gift

Always wanted one!!! Bigger than I remember, very cool light. Color is great. Does get warm but it’s a light with an incandescent bulb so to be expected.  Shipping was quick and arrived in excellent condition.

I love this lava lamp! It has presence. The only bummer is I got the bigger one, so it takes quite a while to warm up and start moving. It’s beautiful once it does though.

—————

I've been using this lamp in my office for the last 3 years now and it's continued to work perfectly. I've had to replace the bulb exactly once in that time, but the quality of the lava and the fluid remains as good as it was the first day I turned it on. It isn't cloudy and it hasn't degraded.This lamp is a great way to add a little color to the otherwise harsh, white light that I'm forced to have with fluorescent bulbs in the work place.

—————

Soothing to watch.

—————

Lamp looks and works great! Just like I remember lava lamps from the stoner Seventies! Plug in, turn on, mesmerizing...

—————

Deco love it

—————

I love my Lava Lamp - it’s beautiful - doesn’t take long to heat up and the lava is gorgeous

—————

My kids love these! We turn the lights on before dinner, and by bedtime, they’re wiggling and bubbling. Best nightlight! Just be sure to turn it off once the kiddos are asleep.

—————

Exactly what my daughter wished for. She uses it as a night light every night.

—————

Grat lava lamp. Thank you.

—————

Fantastic iconic conversation piece.  So relaxing!  Product well made, well packed, and shipped in 2 days!  16" x 40 watts is the way to go.  I'll leave the color selection to you!  The best $25 I have ever spent.  What are you waiting for?

I purchased this lava lamp for my 11yr old daughter. She had been begging for one. It is very mesmerizing to watch. Wish I had one for myself as it’s very relaxing.

—————

Our 6 year old son absolutely loved this! The colours are great and it works fantastically

—————



 The only problem was our bulb didn’t work. I bought a new one and it’s working fine.

—————

My wife bought me this as a Valentine's day gift and I love it. It is big and sits on my desk and is cool to look at. What you see in the pictures is what you get. The size is not your normal lava lamp, but it is not the huge one they make. Good buy for the money.

—————

Got this for my husband for his birthday.  It is in his office at work and he LOVES it!

—————

Love it! Good size and super pretty!

—————

Love it! Exactly what i wanted.

—————

The first one of these I ordered arrived with very cloudy fluid. I hoped after several uses it would clear up, but no such luck. I sent it back and got lucky with the replacement they sent. I guess from reading the other reviews that its a luck of the draw if you get a clear one or not. Amazon makes it easy enough to get a replacement so its still a risk-free purchase when it comes down to it. Very relaxing/soothing/distracting

—————

This Lava Lamp takes me back to the 60's.  My grandson loves it!  Great gift.

—————

Works perfectly. Read the instructions in the user manual and you'll be fine. When turned off all of the wax goes down pretty quickly, nothing left on the top.

I used to have on in the seventies and this one is so much like it

—————

great product

—————

This looks incredible! Its fun to watch, and I have it on my desk next to my computer.

—————

Great value, lovely color and quality is great

—————

Great lava lamp... my daughters love it.Great addition to the bed time routine.

—————

It's very pretty, it produces a nice glow. No problems with set up.

—————

Unusual color combo, very relaxing. I turn it on around noon and turn it off around 10. It creates a constant, soothing presence in my bedroom. The best thing about purchasing through Amazon is their incredible customer service. After just four months my beautiful lava lamp stopped working. I let Amazon know - they graciously and generously replaced it free. Where else can you get service like that?! I love Amazon!

—————

This Lava Lamp is hecka groovy!  Sets the vibe on the regs.

—————

Simply out of this world tubularSo darn ReTro!!!♡♡♡♡

—————

This thing is awesome!  Pics don't do it justice.  The amber coming from the bulb is vibrant on the lava and they fade into a firey red towards the top.  The water is such a good contrast purple/pink.  Mom gave this to Dad for Father's day:)

I love this light; it's really beautiful to look at at night.  They are made in China so if yours doesn't work right ... right out of the box... send it back and get a replacement.  It should work fine & you'll love it

—————

My son absolutely loves this lava lamp. He uses it to help calm him to fall asleep at night.

—————

Packaged nicely. Easy to assemble. Perfect for a teenager's room.

—————

This Lava Lamp works very well - just like the one I had almost 50 years ago.

—————

Cannot stop staring at it when it is on. It is mesmerizing.

—————

I love it its perfect and great quality

—————

Love it

—————

Great old fashion Lava lamp, works as it should, bought smaller version prior, wasn’t as happy as this One flows just great, brings back memories, Lol

—————

My kids both got one of these lamps for christmas and they absolutely love them. They bubble after a few hours off warming up and are very thick and durable unlike others you find that have a flimsy base, these have a sturdy thick and wide base to hold the glass lamp in!

It was a Christmas gift and the kids were so surprised

looks nice

Nostalgia strikes again. Not much you can say about one of the oddest inventions of the 20th century (next to the pet rock). I've read about the problems with the liquid being cloudy but haven't had a problem with mine. It takes awhile to heat up (I think it has an unintended side effect that helps teach you patience). When it does it works fine. No problems with overheating. It just works like a lava lamp should work.

—————

Takes me back to the old days pulling bingers in my buddies' basements... throw in a tapestry and I'm back in 1979 :-)

—————

I love Lava lights so much! I bought two matching of these for the mantle!  The other five are in my bathroom!

—————

Great night light. A soft reddish glow that doesn't keep us awake.I think my dog was a stoner in a former life. She lies on my daughters bed and just stares at the thing.Took a full day to start working properly the first time. No problems since."Pulsating blood urn"

—————

Very nice size and excellent color.  One of the best lamps I have purchased.  I am a lava lamp freak, well what do you want from an old cali hippie.? I have bought at least 20 or more of these and this one is well worth it.  You will not be dissapointed.  Light one up and kick back and let the fun begin.  Peace

Exactly as described, quite large, more of a small lamp.

Was a present for my granddaughter for Christmas.  She loves it

I was worried about this lamp after reading several negative reviews, but took a chance anyway, as it was the size and color I wanted.  When it arrived, the liquid appeared very separated and I told my daughter not to get her hopes up.  She put it in her room, and after the 4 hours of "warming up", the liquid formed beautifully and she just LOVES IT!!!

its perfect :)

This 16.3-inch Lava Lamp is good, but only after I replaced the bulb with a Philips 45W PAR16 Dimmable Flood Light Bulb 434746 available on Amazon or at Home Depot. (By the way, the lamp is listed on the websites as a Halogen, but the package does not state Halogen on it.) The 40 watt incandescent bulb that comes with it just doesn't provide enough heat to get the wax moving. In fact, I ordered this lamp and it worked for a day, then the wax would just sit in the bottom no matter how many hours it was on. I thought it was defective, so I returned it and Amazon replaced it with a new one. The new one did the same thing as the first one, so I figured that it was not getting enough heat for it to work properly. I tried several bulbs including a 60-watt bulb (which worked well, it just got a little too hot). I finally tried the Philips 45 PAR16 indoor/outdoor flood light and it seems to work well. It does get hot, but I can still hold my fingers on the base without it burning. The glass globe, however, does get a bit too hot to keep my fingers on. But it seems to be fine. I hope this info is helpful to others who may think the lamp doesn't work. I now really like the lamp.I gave it 4 stars because I had to fix the lamp for it to work.

Really looked forward to having a classic lava lamp. Arrived on time tonight. Set it up, put it on a solid stable table in library room. Turned it on to warm up per instructions. Went to dinner in nearby kitchen room. Checked on it several times for next hour or two. Returned for warm up check. Lights off? Overhead room lights revealed clear glass broken. Yellow liquid had spewed out onto library table and rug and an art book. A two inch broken piece of glass had cracked loose. No way to fix. Dangerous..sharp. Thankfully no person or animal was hurt! Our cat was nearby but he was okay. Clean up had to be done immediately and the lava lamp had to be put back in its cardboard shipping box and sealed up and carefully placed in our large garbage bucket for safety. Sad moment for us. Big disappointment. Made in China. Distributed in Massachusetts. Don't know why this glass cracked. Just glad no one was nearby and injured. I think we are not confident now to re-order. It had begun to warm up and making the initial snake like shapes. We really were thrilled to go back to the old days of lava lamps. This is a great disappointment, unusual for Amazon. We handled the project very carefully. We really don't want to run this risk again. We're long time buyers of Amazon and we're sorry to report this dangerous incident; at this point we would just want to have our purchase returned to our account. Don't want to run this risk again. Structurally this product was not able to turn itself "on" without over heating causing its side to explode shooting out its fluids. Good news: just glad no one was hurt. Sad night here.

Just a great looking lava lamp.  Clear fluid and the wax moves well. Takes 1 to 2 hours to heat up

—————

It’s exactly as described and works perfectly.

The lamp was a gift for my 41 yr old daughters birthday.  She loves it!!!

—————

Very soothing night lite for the kids room.

Got it out of the box and let it set a few hours plugged it in and working fine.

I ordered this lamp for my new home (it is not finished yet). I let my mom use it until my home is ready to move in. This lamp is hypnotic! We love it. Wax moves different every day. It is a good size and good looking lamp. I think is prettier in person. Picture do not make justice. It is GROOVY!

—————

Love it. It brings back good memories. Works great.

—————

Works greatReminds me of my teenage years.

I'm totally pleased with this lava lamp. It works perfectly. The lava flows as it should in the liquid. No cloudiness. No problems. The lamp takes two or more hours to warm up for the lava to rise smoothly, but that's normal for lava lamps. Good price, good quality. It arrived promptly in good condition. I'm glad I bought it.

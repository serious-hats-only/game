ABOUT THIS MANUAL
Thank you for choosing Ford. We
recommend that you take some time to
get to know your vehicle by reading this
manual. The more that you know about
your vehicle, the greater the safety and
pleasure you will get from driving it.
WARNING
Driving while distracted can result in
loss of vehicle control, crash and
injury. We strongly recommend that
you use extreme caution when using any
device that may take your focus off the
road. Your primary responsibility is the safe
operation of your vehicle. We recommend
against the use of any hand-held device
while driving and encourage the use of
voice-operated systems when possible.
Make sure you are aware of all applicable
local laws that may affect the use of
electronic devices while driving.
Note: This manual describes product
features and options available throughout
the range of available models, sometimes
even before they are generally available. It
may describe options not fitted to the
vehicle you have purchased.
Note: Some of the illustrations in this
manual may show features as used in
different models, so they may appear
different to you on your vehicle.
Note: Always use and operate your vehicle
in line with all applicable laws and
regulations.
Note: Pass on this manual when selling
your vehicle. It is an integral part of your
vehicle.
This manual may qualify the location of a
component as left-hand side or right-hand
side. The side is determined when facing
forward in the seat.

DATA RECORDING
Service Data Recording
Service data recorders in your vehicle are
capable of collecting and storing
diagnostic information about your vehicle.
This potentially includes information about
the performance or status of various
systems and modules in the vehicle, such
as engine, throttle, steering or brake
systems. In order to properly diagnose and
service your vehicle, Ford Motor Company,
Ford of Canada, and service and repair
facilities may access or share among them
vehicle diagnostic information received
through a direct connection to your vehicle
when diagnosing or servicing your vehicle.
Additionally, when your vehicle is in for
service or repair, Ford Motor Company,
Ford of Canada, and service and repair
facilities may access or share among them
data for vehicle improvement purposes.
For U.S. only (if equipped), if you choose
to use the SYNC Vehicle Health Report,
you consent that certain diagnostic
information may also be accessed
electronically by Ford Motor Company and
Ford authorized service facilities, and that
the diagnostic information may be used
for any purpose. See SYNC™ (page 294).
Event Data Recording
This vehicle is equipped with an event
data recorder. The main purpose of an
event data recorder is to record, in
certain crash or near crash-like
situations, such as an airbag
deployment or hitting a road obstacle;
this data will assist in understanding
how a vehicle’s systems performed.
The event data recorder is designed to
record data related to vehicle dynamics
and safety systems for a short period
of time, typically 30 seconds or less.
The event data recorder in this vehicle
is designed to record such data as:
• How various systems in your vehicle
were operating;
• Whether or not the driver and
passenger safety belts were
buckled/fastened;
• How far (if at all) the driver was
depressing the accelerator and/or
the brake pedal; and
• How fast the vehicle was traveling;
and
• Where the driver was positioning
the steering wheel.
9
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Introduction
This data can help provide a better
understanding of the circumstances in
which crashes and injuries occur.
Note: Event data recorder data is
recorded by your vehicle only if a
non-trivial crash situation occurs; no data
is recorded by the event data recorder
under normal driving conditions and no
personal data or information (e.g., name,
gender, age, and crash location) is
recorded (see limitations regarding 911
Assist and Traffic, directions and
Information privacy below). However,
parties, such as law enforcement, could
combine the event data recorder data
with the type of personally identifying
data routinely acquired during a crash
investigation.
To read data recorded by an event data
recorder, special equipment is required,
and access to the vehicle or the event
data recorder is needed. In addition to
the vehicle manufacturer, other
parties, such as law enforcement, that
have such special equipment, can read
the information if they have access to
the vehicle or the event data recorder.
Ford Motor Company and Ford of
Canada do not access event data
recorder information without obtaining
consent, unless pursuant to court order
or where required by law enforcement,
other government authorities or other
third parties acting with lawful
authority. Other parties may seek to
access the information independently
of Ford Motor Company and Ford of
Canada.
Note: Including to the extent that any
law pertaining to Event Data Recorders
applies to SYNC or its features, please
note the following: Once 911 Assist (if
equipped) is enabled (set ON), 911 Assist
may, through any paired and connected
cell phone, disclose to emergency
services that the vehicle has been in a
crash involving the deployment of an
airbag or, in certain vehicles, the
activation of the fuel pump shut-off.
Certain versions or updates to 911 Assist
may also be capable of being used to
electronically or verbally provide to 911
operators the vehicle location (such as
latitude and longitude), and/or other
details about the vehicle or crash or
personal information about the
occupants to assist 911 operators to
provide the most appropriate emergency
services. If you do not want to disclose
this information, do not activate the 911
Assist feature. See SYNC™ (page 294).
Additionally, when you connect to
Traffic, Directions and Information (if
equipped, U.S. only), the service uses
GPS technology and advanced vehicle
sensors to collect the vehicle’s current
location, travel direction, and speed
(“vehicle travel information”), only to
help provide you with the directions,
traffic reports, or business searches
that you request. If you do not want
Ford or its vendors to receive this
information, do not activate the
service. For more information, see
Traffic, Directions and Information,
Terms and Conditions. See SYNC™
(page 294).

REPLACEMENT PARTS
RECOMMENDATION
Your vehicle has been built to the highest
standards using quality parts. We
recommend that you demand the use of
genuine Ford and Motorcraft parts
whenever your vehicle requires scheduled
maintenance or repair. You can clearly
identify genuine Ford and Motorcraft parts
by looking for the Ford, FoMoCo or
Motorcraft branding on the parts or their
packaging.
Scheduled Maintenance and
Mechanical Repairs
One of the best ways for you to make sure
that your vehicle provides years of service
is to have it maintained in line with our
recommendations using parts that
conform to the specifications detailed in
this Owner’s Manual. Genuine Ford and
Motorcraft parts meet or exceed these
specifications.
Collision Repairs
We hope that you never experience a
collision, but accidents do happen. Genuine
Ford replacement collision parts meet our
stringent requirements for fit, finish,
structural integrity, corrosion protection
and dent resistance. During vehicle
11
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Introduction
development we validate these parts
deliver the intended level of protection as
a whole system. A great way to know for
sure you are getting this level of protection
is to use genuine Ford replacement
collision parts.
Warranty on Replacement Parts
Genuine Ford and Motorcraft replacement
parts are the only replacement parts that
benefit from a Ford Warranty. Damage
caused to your vehicle as a result of the
failure of non-Ford parts may not be
covered by the Ford Warranty. For
additional information, refer to the terms
and conditions of the Ford Warranty.
SPECIAL NOTICES
New Vehicle Limited Warranty
For a detailed description of what is
covered and what is not covered by your
vehicle’s New Vehicle Limited Warranty,
refer to the Warranty Manual that is
provided to you along with your Owner’s
Manual.
Special Instructions
For your added safety, your vehicle is fitted
with sophisticated electronic controls.
WARNINGS
You risk death or serious injury to
yourself and others if you do not
follow the instruction highlighted by
the warning symbol. Failure to follow the
specific warnings and instructions could
result in personal injury.
Front seat mounted rear-facing child
or infant seats should NEVER be
placed in front of an active
passenger airbag.
On-board Diagnostics (OBD-II)
Your vehicle’s On-board Diagnostics
(OBD-II) system has a data port for
diagnostics, repair and reprogramming
services with diagnostic scan tools.
Installing a non-Ford-approved
aftermarket OBD plug-in device that uses
the port during normal driving, for example
remote insurance company monitoring,
remote vehicle diagnostics, telematics or
engine reprogramming, may cause
interference or damage to vehicle systems.
We do not recommend or endorse the use
of any non-Ford-approved aftermarket
OBD plug-in devices. The vehicle Warranty
may not cover damage caused by any
non-Ford-approved aftermarket OBD
plug-in device.
MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS
EQUIPMENT
Using mobile communications equipment
is becoming increasingly important in the
conduct of business and personal affairs.
However, you must not compromise your
own or others’ safety when using such
equipment. Mobile communications can
enhance personal safety and security when
appropriately used, particularly in
emergency situations. Safety must be
paramount when using mobile
communications equipment to avoid
negating these benefits. Mobile
communication equipment includes, but
is not limited to, cellular phones, pagers,
portable email devices, text messaging
devices and portable two-way radios.

GENERAL INFORMATION
See the following sections for directions
on how to properly use safety restraints
for children.
WARNINGS
Always make sure your child is
secured properly in a device that is
appropriate for their height, age and
weight. Child safety restraints must be
bought separately from your vehicle.
Failure to follow these instructions and
guidelines may result in an increased risk
of serious injury or death to your child.
All children are shaped differently.
The recommendations for safety
restraints are based on probable
child height, age and weight thresholds
from National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration and other safety
organizations, or are the minimum
requirements of law. Ford recommends
checking with a NHTSA Certified Child
Passenger Safety Technician (CPST) and
consult your pediatrician to make sure your
child seat is appropriate for your child, and
WARNINGS
is compatible with and properly installed
in your vehicle. To locate a child seat fitting
station and CPST, contact the NHTSA toll
free at 1-888-327-4236 or go to
http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov. In Canada,
check with your local St. John Ambulance
office for referral to a CPST or for further
information, contact your provincial
ministry of transportation, locate your local
St. John Ambulance office by searching for
St. John Ambulance on the internet, or
Transport Canada at 1-800-333-0371
(http://www.tc.gc.ca). Failure to properly
restrain children in safety seats made
especially for their height, age, and weight
may result in an increased risk of serious
injury or death to your child.
Do not leave children or animals
unattended in the vehicle. On hot
days, the temperature in the trunk or
vehicle interior can rise very quickly.
Exposure of people or animals to these
high temperatures for even a short time
can cause death or serious heat-related
injuries, including brain damage. Small
children are particularly at risk.
15
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Child Safety
Recommendations for Safety Restraints for Children
Recommended restraint
type
Child Child size, height, weight, or age
Use a child safety seat
(sometimes called an
infant carrier, convertible
seat, or toddler seat).
Children weighing 40 lb (18 kg) or less
(generally age four or younger).
Infants or
toddlers
Use a belt-positioning
booster seat.
Children who have outgrown or no longer
properly fit in a child safety seat (generally children who are less than 4 ft. 9 in.
(1.45 m) tall, are greater than age four
and less than age 12, and between 40 lb
(18 kg) and 80 lb (36 kg) and upward to
100 lb (45 kg) if recommended by your
child restraint manufacturer).
Small children
Use a vehicle safety belt
having the lap belt snug
and low across the hips,
shoulder belt centered
across the shoulder and
chest, and seat back
upright.
Children who have outgrown or no longer
properly fit in a belt-positioning booster
seat (generally children who are at least
4 ft. 9 in. (1.45 m) tall or greater than 80
lb (36 kg) or 100 lb (45 kg) if recommended by child restraint manufacturer).
Larger children
• You are required by law to properly use
safety seats for infants and toddlers in
the United States and Canada.
• Many states and provinces require that
small children use approved booster
seats until they reach age eight, a
height of 4 feet 9 inches (1.45 meters)
tall, or 80 pounds (36 kilograms).
Check your local and state or provincial
laws for specific requirements about
the safety of children in your vehicle.
• When possible, always properly
restrain children 12 years of age and
under in a rear seating position of your
vehicle. Accident statistics suggest that
children are safer when properly
restrained in the rear seating positions
than in a front seating position. See
Front Passenger Sensing System
(page 38).

Airbags can kill or injure a child in a
child seat. Never place a rear-facing
child seat in front of an active airbag.
If you must use a forward-facing child seat
in the front seat, move the seat upon which
the child seat is installed all the way back.
Airbags can kill or injure a child in a
child seat. Children 12 and under
should be properly restrained in the
rear seat whenever possible.
Depending on where you secure a
child restraint, and depending on the
child restraint design, you may block
access to certain safety belt buckle
assemblies and LATCH lower anchors,
rendering those features potentially
unusable. To avoid risk of injury, occupants
should only use seating positions where
they are able to be properly restrained.
When installing a child safety seat with
combination lap and shoulder belts:
• Use the correct safety belt buckle for
that seating position.
• Insert the belt tongue into the proper
buckle until you hear a snap and feel it
latch. Make sure the tongue is securely
fastened in the buckle.
• Keep the buckle release button
pointing up and away from the safety
seat, with the tongue between the child
seat and the release button, to prevent
accidental unbuckling.
• Place the vehicle seat upon which the
child seat will be installed in the upright
position.
• Put the safety belt in the automatic
locking mode. See Step 5. This vehicle
does not require the use of a locking
clip.
Perform the following steps when
installing the child seat with combination
lap and shoulder belts:
Note: Although the child seat illustrated is
a forward facing child seat, the steps are
the same for installing a rear facing child
seat.
E142528
1. Position the child safety seat in a seat
with a combination lap and shoulder
belt.
E142529
17
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Child Safety
2. Pull down on the shoulder belt and
then grasp the shoulder belt and lap
belt together.
E142530
3. While holding the shoulder and lap belt
portions together, route the tongue
through the child seat according to the
child seat manufacturer's instructions.
Be sure the belt webbing is not twisted.
E142531
4. Insert the belt tongue into the proper
buckle (the buckle closest to the
direction the tongue is coming from)
for that seating position until you hear
a snap and feel the latch engage. Make
sure the tongue is latched securely by
pulling on it.
E142875
5. To put the retractor in the automatic
locking mode, grasp the shoulder
portion of the belt and pull downward
until all of the belt is pulled out.
Note: The automatic locking mode is
available on the front passenger and rear
seats.
6. Allow the belt to retract to remove
slack. The belt will click as it retracts
to indicate it is in the automatic locking
mode.
7. Try to pull the belt out of the retractor
to make sure the retractor is in the
automatic locking mode (you should
not be able to pull more belt out). If the
retractor is not locked, unbuckle the
belt and repeat Steps 5 and 6.
E142533
18
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Child Safety
8. Remove remaining slack from the belt.
Force the seat down with extra weight,
for example, by pressing down or
kneeling on the child restraint while
pulling up on the shoulder belt in order
to force slack from the belt. This is
necessary to remove the remaining
slack that will exist once the extra
weight of the child is added to the child
restraint. It also helps to achieve the
proper snugness of the child seat to
your vehicle. Sometimes, a slight lean
toward the buckle will additionally help
to remove remaining slack from the
belt.
9. Attach the tether strap (if the child seat
is equipped).
E142534
10. Before placing the child in the seat,
forcibly move the seat forward and
back to make sure the seat is securely
held in place. To check this, grab the
seat at the belt path and attempt to
move it side to side and forward and
back. There should be no more than
1 inch (2.5 centimeters) of movement
for proper installation.
Ford recommends checking with a NHTSA
Certified Child Passenger Safety
Technician to make certain the child
restraint is properly installed. In Canada,
check with your local St. John Ambulance
office for referral to a Certified Passenger
Seat Technician.
Using Lower Anchors and Tethers
for Children (LATCH)
WARNINGS
Never attach two child safety seats
to the same anchor. In a crash, one
anchor may not be strong enough to
hold two child safety seat attachments
and may break, causing serious injury or
death.
Depending on where you secure a
child restraint, and depending on the
child restraint design, you may block
access to certain safety belt buckle
assemblies or LATCH lower anchors,
rendering those features potentially
unusable. To avoid risk of injury, occupants
should only use seating positions where
they are able to be properly restrained.
The LATCH system is composed of three
vehicle anchor points: two lower anchors
located where the seatback and seat
cushion meet (called the seat bight) and
one top tether anchor located behind that
seating position.
LATCH compatible child safety seats have
two rigid or webbing mounted
attachments that connect to the two lower
anchors at the LATCH equipped seating
positions in your vehicle. This type of
attachment method eliminates the need
to use safety belts to attach the child seat,
however the safety belt can still be used
to attach the child seat. For forward-facing
child seats, the top tether strap must also
be attached to the proper top tether
anchor, if a top tether strap has been
provided with your child seat.
19
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Child Safety
E142535
Your vehicle has LATCH lower anchors for
child seat installation at the seating
positions marked with the child seat
symbol.
E169083
The LATCH anchors are located at the rear
section of the rear seat between the
cushion and seatback above the symbols
as shown. Follow the child seat
manufacturer's instructions to properly
install a child seat with LATCH
attachments. Follow the instructions on
attaching child safety seats with tether
straps.
Attach LATCH lower attachments of the
child seat only to the anchors shown.
Use of Inboard Lower Anchors from the
Outboard Seating Positions (Center
Seating Use)
WARNING
The standardized spacing for LATCH
lower anchors is 11 inches (28
centimeters) center to center. Do not
use LATCH lower anchors for the center
seating position unless the child seat
manufacturer's instructions permit and
specify using anchors spaced at least as
far apart as those in this vehicle.
The lower anchors at the center of the
second row rear seat are spaced 18 inches
(46 centimeters) apart. A child seat with
rigid LATCH attachments cannot be
installed at the center seating position.
LATCH compatible child seats (with
attachments on belt webbing) can only be
used at this seating position provided that
the child seat manufacturer's instructions
permit use with the anchor spacing stated.
Do not attach a child seat to any lower
anchor if an adjacent child seat is attached
to that anchor.
Each time you use the safety seat, check
that the seat is properly attached to the
lower anchors and tether anchor, if
applicable. Tug the child seat from side to
side and forward and back where it is
secured to your vehicle. The seat should
move less than one inch when you do this
for a proper installation.
If the safety seat is not anchored properly,
the risk of a child being injured in a crash
greatly increases.

Combining Safety Belt and LATCH
Lower Anchors for Attaching Child
Safety Seats
When used in combination, either the
safety belt or the LATCH lower anchors
may be attached first, provided a proper
installation is achieved. Attach the tether
strap afterward, if included with the child
seat.
Using Tether Straps
Many forward-facing child safety
seats include a tether strap
which extends from the back of
the child safety seat and hooks to an
anchoring point called the top tether
anchor. Tether straps are available as an
accessory for many older safety seats.
Contact the manufacturer of your child
seat for information about ordering a
tether strap, or to obtain a longer tether
strap if the tether strap on your safety seat
does not reach the appropriate top tether
anchor in your vehicle.
The rear seats of your vehicle are equipped
with built-in tether strap anchors located
behind the seats as described below.
Four door: The tether anchors in your
vehicle are located under a cover marked
with the tether anchor symbol (shown with
title).
Five door: The tether anchors in your
vehicle are located on the back panel of
the rear seat.
E142537
The tether strap anchors in your vehicle
are in the following positions (shown from
top view):
Perform the following steps to install a
child safety seat with tether anchors:
Note: If you install a child seat with rigid
LATCH attachments, do not tighten the
tether strap enough to lift the child seat off
your vehicle seat cushion when the child is
seated in it. Keep the tether strap just snug
without lifting the front of the child seat.
Keeping the child seat just touching your
vehicle seat gives the best protection in a
severe crash.
Four Door
1. Route the child safety seat tether strap
over the back of the seat. For outboard
seating positions, route the tether strap
under the head restraint and between
the head restraint posts. For the center
seating positions, route the tether strap
over the top of the head restraint.

incorrectly, the child safety seat may
not be retained properly in the event of
a crash.
5. Tighten the child safety seat tether
strap according to the manufacturer's
instructions. If the safety seat is not
anchored properly, the risk of a child
being injured in a crash greatly

BOOSTER SEATS
WARNING
Never place, or allow a child to place,
the shoulder belt under a child's arm
or behind the back because it
reduces the protection for the upper part
of the body and may increase the risk of
injury or death in a crash.
Use a belt-positioning booster seat for
children who have outgrown or no longer
properly fit in a child safety seat (generally
children who are less than 4 feet 9 inches
(1.45 meters) tall, are greater than age four
(4) and less than age twelve (12), and
between 40 pounds (18 kilograms) and
80 pounds (36 kilograms) and upward to
100 pounds (45 kilograms) if
recommended by your child restraint
manufacturer). Many state and provincial
laws require that children use approved
booster seats until they reach age eight, a
height of 4 feet 9 inches (1.45 meters) tall,
or 80 pounds (36 kilograms).
Booster seats should be used until you can
answer YES to ALL of these questions
when seated without a booster seat:
E142595
• Can the child sit all the way back
against their vehicle seat back with
knees bent comfortably at the edge of
the seat cushion?
• Can the child sit without slouching?
• Does the lap belt rest low across the
hips?
• Is the shoulder belt centered on the
shoulder and chest?
• Can the child stay seated like this for
the whole trip?
Always use booster seats in conjunction
with your vehicle lap and shoulder belt.
Types of Booster Seats
E68924
• Backless booster seats
If your backless booster seat has a
removable shield, remove the shield. If a
vehicle seating position has a low seat
back or no head restraint, a backless
booster seat may place your child's head
(as measured at the tops of the ears)
above the top of the seat. In this case,
move the backless booster to another
seating position with a higher seat back or
head restraint and lap and shoulder belts,
or consider using a high back booster seat.
23
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Child Safety
E70710
• High back booster seats
If, with a backless booster seat, you cannot
find a seating position that adequately
supports your child's head, a high back
booster seat would be a better choice.
Children and booster seats vary in size and
shape. Choose a booster that keeps the
lap belt low and snug across the hips,
never up across the stomach, and lets you
adjust the shoulder belt to cross the chest
and rest snugly near the center of the
shoulder. The following drawings compare
the ideal fit (center) to a shoulder belt
uncomfortably close to the neck and a
shoulder belt that could slip off the
shoulder. The drawings also show how the
lap belt should be low and snug across the
child's hips.

Child Safety
If the booster seat slides on the vehicle
seat upon which it is being used, placing a
rubberized mesh sold as shelf or carpet
liner under the booster seat may improve
this condition. Do not introduce any item
thicker than this under the booster seat.
Check with the booster seat
manufacturer's instructions.
CHILD RESTRAINT
POSITIONING
WARNINGS
Airbags can kill or injure a child in a
child seat. Never place a rear-facing
child seat in front of an active airbag.
If you must use a forward-facing child seat
in the front seat, move the vehicle seat
upon which the child seat is installed all
the way back. When possible, all children
age 12 and under should be properly
restrained in a rear seating position. If all
children cannot be seated and restrained
properly in a rear seating position, properly
restrain the largest child in the front seat.
Always carefully follow the
instructions and warnings provided
by the manufacturer of any child
restraint to determine if the restraint device
is appropriate for your child's size, height,
weight, or age. Follow the child restraint
manufacturer's instructions and warnings
provided for installation and use in
WARNINGS
conjunction with the instructions and
warnings provided by your vehicle
manufacturer. A safety seat that is
improperly installed or utilized, is
inappropriate for your child's height, age,
or weight or does not properly fit the child
may increase the risk of serious injury or
death.
Never let a passenger hold a child on
his or her lap while your vehicle is
moving. The passenger cannot
protect the child from injury in a crash,
which may result in serious injury or death.
Never use pillows, books, or towels
to boost a child. They can slide
around and increase the likelihood
of injury or death in a crash.
Always restrain an unoccupied child
seat or booster seat. These objects
may become projectiles in a crash or
sudden stop, which may increase the risk
of serious injury.
Never place, or allow a child to place,
the shoulder belt under a child's arm
or behind the back because it
reduces the protection for the upper part
of the body and may increase the risk of
injury or death in a crash.
To avoid risk of injury, do not leave
children or pets unattended in your
vehicle.

PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION
WARNINGS
Always drive and ride with your
seatback upright and the lap belt
snug and low across the hips.
To reduce the risk of injury, make
sure children sit where they can be
properly restrained.
Never let a passenger hold a child on
his or her lap while your vehicle is
moving. The passenger cannot
protect the child from injury in a crash.
All occupants of your vehicle,
including the driver, should always
properly wear their seatbelts, even
when an airbag supplemental restraint
system is provided. Failure to properly wear
your seatbelts could seriously increase the
risk of injury or death.
It is extremely dangerous to ride in a
cargo area, inside or outside of a
vehicle. In a crash, people riding in
these areas are more likely to be seriously
injured or killed. Do not allow people to ride
in any area of your vehicle that is not
equipped with seats and seatbelts. Be sure
everyone in your vehicle is in a seat and
using a seatbelt properly.
In a rollover crash, an unbelted
person is significantly more likely to
die than a person wearing a seatbelt.
Each seating position in your vehicle
has a specific seatbelt assembly
which is made up of one buckle and
one tongue that are designed to be used
as a pair. 1) Use the shoulder belt on the
outside shoulder only. Never wear the
shoulder belt under the arm. 2) Never
swing the seatbelt around your neck over
the inside shoulder. 3) Never use a single
belt for more than one person.
WARNINGS
When possible, all children 12 years
old and under should be properly
restrained in a rear seating position.
Failure to follow this could seriously
increase the risk of injury or death.
Seatbelts and seats can become hot
in a vehicle that has been closed up
in sunny weather; they could burn a
small child. Check seat covers and buckles
before you place a child anywhere near
them.
Front and rear seat occupants,
including pregnant women, should
wear seatbelts for optimum
protection in an accident.
All seating positions in your vehicle have
lap and shoulder seatbelts. All occupants
of the vehicle should always properly wear
their seatbelts, even when an airbag
supplemental restraint system is provided.
The seatbelt system consists of:
• Lap and shoulder seatbelts.
• Shoulder seatbelt with automatic
locking mode, (except driver seatbelt).
• Height adjuster at the front outboard
seating positions.
• Seatbelt pretensioner at the front
outboard seating positions.
• Belt tension sensor at the front
outboard passenger seating position.
· Seatbelt warning light and
chime.
· Crash sensors and monitoring
system with readiness indicator.
28
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Seatbelts
The seatbelt pretensioners at the front
seating positions are designed to tighten
the seatbelts when activated. In frontal
and near-frontal crashes, the seatbelt
pretensioners may be activated alone or,
if the crash is of sufficient severity, together
with the front airbags. The pretensioners
will activate when the Safety Canopy is
deployed.
FASTENING THE SEATBELTS
The front outboard and rear safety
restraints in the vehicle are combination
lap and shoulder belts.
E142587
1. Insert the belt tongue into the proper
buckle (the buckle closest to the
direction the tongue is coming from)
until you hear a snap and feel it latch.
Make sure the tongue is securely
fastened in the buckle.

2. To unfasten, press the release button
and remove the tongue from the
buckle.
Using Safety Belts During
Pregnancy
WARNING
Always ride and drive with your
seatback upright and the safety belt
properly fastened. The lap portion of
the safety belt should fit snug and be
positioned low across the hips. The
shoulder portion of the safety belt should
be positioned across the chest. Pregnant
women should also follow this practice.
See the following figure.
E142590
29
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Seatbelts
Pregnant women should always wear their
safety belt. The lap belt portion of a
combination lap and shoulder belt should
be positioned low across the hips below
the belly and worn as tight as comfort will
allow. The shoulder belt should be
positioned to cross the middle of the
shoulder and the center of the chest.
Safety Belt Locking Modes
WARNINGS
After any vehicle crash, the safety
belt system at all passenger seating
positions must be checked by an
authorized dealer to verify that the
automatic locking retractor feature for
child seats is still functioning properly. In
addition, all safety belts should be checked
for proper function.
The belt and retractor assembly
must be replaced if the safety belt
assembly automatic locking retractor
feature or any other safety belt function is
not operating properly when checked by
an authorized dealer. Failure to replace the
belt and retractor assembly could increase
the risk of injury in crashes.
All safety restraints in the vehicle are
combination lap and shoulder belts. The
driver safety belt has the first type of
locking mode. The front outboard
passenger and rear seat safety belts have
both types of locking modes described as
follows:
Vehicle Sensitive Mode
This is the normal retractor mode, which
allows free shoulder belt length
adjustment to your movements and
locking in response to vehicle movement.
For example, if the driver brakes suddenly
or turns a corner sharply, or the vehicle
receives an impact of about 5 mph
(8 km/h) or more, the combination safety
belts will lock to help reduce forward
movement of the driver and passengers.
In addition, the retractor is designed to lock
if the webbing is pulled out too quickly. If
this occurs, let the belt retract slightly and
pull webbing out again in a slow and
controlled manner.
Automatic Locking Mode
In this mode, the shoulder belt is
automatically pre-locked. The belt will still
retract to remove any slack in the shoulder
belt. The automatic locking mode is not
available on the driver safety belt.
When to Use the Automatic Locking
Mode
This mode should be used any time a child
safety seat, except a booster, is installed
in passenger front or rear seating positions.
Children 12 years old and under should be
properly restrained in a rear seating
position whenever possible. See Child
Safety (page 15).
30
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Seatbelts
How to Use the Automatic Locking
Mode
E142591
1. Buckle the combination lap and
shoulder belt.
2. Grasp the shoulder portion and pull
downward until the entire belt is pulled
out.
Allow the belt to retract. As the belt
retracts, you will hear a clicking sound. This
indicates the safety belt is now in the
automatic locking mode.
How to Disengage the Automatic
Locking Mode
Unbuckle the combination lap and
shoulder belt and allow it to retract
completely to disengage the automatic
locking mode and activate the vehicle
sensitive (emergency) locking mode.
Safety Belt Extension Assembly
WARNING
Do not use extensions to change the
fit of the shoulder belt across the
torso.
If the safety belt is too short when fully
extended, a safety belt extension assembly
can be obtained from an authorized dealer.
Use only extensions manufactured by the
same supplier as the safety belt.
Manufacturer identification is on a label
located either at the end of the webbing
or on the retractor behind the trim. Also,
use the safety belt extension only if the
safety belt is too short for you when fully
extended.
SEATBELT HEIGHT
ADJUSTMENT
WARNING
Position the safety belt height
adjuster so that the belt rests across
the middle of your shoulder. Failure
to adjust the safety belt properly could
reduce the effectiveness of the safety belt
and increase the risk of injury in a crash.
Adjust the height of the shoulder belt so
the belt rests across the middle of your
shoulder.

CHILD RESTRAINT AND
SEATBELT MAINTENANCE
Inspect the vehicle safety belts and child
safety seat systems periodically to make
sure they work properly and are not
damaged. Inspect the vehicle and child
seat safety belts to make sure there are no
nicks, tears or cuts. Replace if necessary.
All vehicle safety belt assemblies, including
retractors, buckles, front safety belt buckle
assemblies, buckle support assemblies
(slide bar-if equipped), shoulder belt
height adjusters (if equipped), shoulder
belt guide on seat back (if equipped), child
safety seat LATCH and tether anchors, and
attaching hardware, should be inspected
after a crash. Read the child restraint
manufacturer's instructions for additional
inspection and maintenance information
specific to the child restraint.
Ford Motor Company recommends that
all safety belt assemblies in use in vehicles
involved in a crash be replaced. However,
if the crash was minor and an authorized
dealer finds that the belts do not show
damage and continue to operate properly,
they do not need to be replaced. Safety
belt assemblies not in use during a crash
should also be inspected and replaced if
either damage or improper operation is
noted.
Properly care for safety belts. See Vehicle
Care (page 234).

Seatbelts
The Personal Safety System provides an
improved overall level of frontal crash
protection to front seat occupants and is
designed to help further reduce the risk of
airbag-related injuries. The system is able
to analyze different occupant conditions
and crash severity before activating the
appropriate safety devices to help better
protect a range of occupants in a variety
of frontal crash situations.
The Vehicle Personal Safety System
consists of:
• Driver and passenger dual-stage airbag
supplemental restraints.
• Front seat outboard safety belts with
pretensioners, energy management
retractors and safety belt usage
sensors.
• Driver seat position sensor.
• Front passenger sensing system.
• Passenger airbag off and on indicator
lamp.
• Front crash severity sensors.
• Restraints control module with impact
and safing sensors.
• Restraint system warning light and
backup tone.
• The electrical wiring for the airbags,
crash sensors, safety belt
pretensioners, front safety belt usage
sensors, driver seat position sensor,
front passenger sensing system and
indicator lights.
How Does the Personal Safety
System Work?
The Personal Safety System can adapt the
deployment strategy of the safety devices
according to crash severity and occupant
conditions. A collection of crash and
occupant sensors provides information to
the restraints control module. During a
crash, the restraints control module may
deploy the safety belt pretensioners, one
or both stages of the dual-stage airbags
based on crash severity and occupant
conditions.

Personal Safety System™
PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION
WARNINGS
Airbags do not inflate slowly or
gently, and the risk of injury from a
deploying airbag is the greatest close
to the trim covering the airbag module.
All occupants of your vehicle,
including the driver, should always
properly wear their safety belts, even
when an airbag supplemental restraint
system is provided. Failure to properly wear
your safety belt could seriously increase
the risk of injury or death.
Always transport children 12 years
old and under in the back seat and
always properly use appropriate
child restraints. Failure to follow this could
seriously increase the risk of injury or death.
Never place your arm over the airbag
module as a deploying airbag can
result in serious arm fractures or
other injuries.
Airbags can kill or injure a child in a
child seat. Never place a rear-facing
child seat in front of an active airbag.
If you must use a forward-facing child seat
in the front seat, move the seat upon which
the child seat is installed all the way back.
Do not attempt to service, repair, or
modify the airbag supplemental
restraint systems or its fuses as you
could be seriously injured or killed. Contact
your authorized dealer as soon as possible.
Several airbag system components
get hot after inflation. To reduce the
risk of injury, do not touch them after
inflation.
If the airbag has deployed, the airbag
will not function again and must be
replaced immediately. If the airbag
is not replaced, the unrepaired area will
increase the risk of injury in a crash.
The airbags are a supplemental restraint
system and are designed to work with the
safety belts to help protect the driver and
right front passenger from certain upper
body injuries. Airbags do not inflate slowly;
there is a risk of injury from a deploying
airbag.
Note: You will hear a loud bang and see a
cloud of harmless powdery residue if an
airbag deploys. This is normal.
The airbags inflate and deflate rapidly
upon activation. After airbag deployment,
it is normal to notice a smoke-like, powdery
residue or smell the burnt propellant. This
may consist of cornstarch, talcum powder
(to lubricate the bag) or sodium
compounds (for example, baking soda)
that result from the combustion process
that inflates the airbag. Small amounts of
sodium hydroxide may be present which
may irritate the skin and eyes, but none of
the residue is toxic.
While the system is designed to help
reduce serious injuries, contact with a
deploying airbag may also cause abrasions
or swelling. Temporary hearing loss is also
a possibility as a result of the noise
associated with a deploying airbag.
Because airbags must inflate rapidly and
with considerable force, there is the risk of
death or serious injuries such as fractures,
facial and eye injuries or internal injuries,
particularly to occupants who are not
properly restrained or are otherwise out of
position at the time of airbag deployment.
Thus, it is extremely important that
occupants be properly restrained as far
away from the airbag module as possible
while maintaining vehicle control.
Routine maintenance of the airbags is not
required.

DRIVER AND PASSENGER
AIRBAGS
WARNINGS
Never place your arm or any objects
over an airbag module. Placing your
arm over a deploying airbag can
result in serious arm fractures or other
injuries. Objects placed on or over the
airbag inflation area may cause those
objects to be propelled by the airbag into
your face and torso causing serious injury.
Airbags can kill or injure a child in a
child seat. Never place a rear-facing
child seat in front of an active airbag.
If you must use a forward-facing child seat
in the front seat, move the seat upon which
the child seat is installed all the way back.
E151127
The driver and front passenger airbags will
deploy during significant frontal and near
frontal crashes.
The driver and passenger front airbag
system consists of:
• Driver and passenger airbag modules.
• Front passenger sensing system.
· Crash sensors and monitoring
system with readiness indicator.
See Crash Sensors and Airbag
Indicator (page 43).
Proper Driver and Front Passenger
Seating Adjustment
WARNING
National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA)
recommends a minimum distance
of at least 10 inches (25 centimeters)
between an occupant’s chest and the
driver airbag module.
To properly position yourself away from
the airbag:
• Move your seat to the rear as far as you
can while still reaching the pedals
comfortably.
• Recline the seat slightly (one or two
degrees) from the upright position.
After all occupants have adjusted their
seats and put on safety belts, it is very
important that they continue to sit
properly. A properly seated occupant sits
upright, leaning against the seat back, and
centered on the seat cushion, with their
feet comfortably extended on the floor.
Sitting improperly can increase the chance
of injury in a crash event. For example, if
an occupant slouches, lies down, turns
sideways, sits forward, leans forward or
sideways, or puts one or both feet up, the
chance of injury during a crash is greatly
increased.
Children and Airbags
WARNING
Airbags can kill or injure a child in a
child seat. Never place a rear-facing
child seat in front of an active airbag.
If you must use a forward-facing child seat
in the front seat, move the seat upon which
the child seat is installed all the way back.

E142846
Children must always be properly
restrained. Accident statistics suggest that
children are safer when properly restrained
in the rear seating positions than in the
front seating position. Failure to follow
these instructions may increase the risk of
injury in a crash.
FRONT PASSENGER SENSING
SYSTEM
WARNINGS
Even with Advanced Restraints
Systems, children 12 and under
should be properly restrained in a
rear seating position. Failure to follow this
could seriously increase the risk of injury or
death.
Sitting improperly out of position or
with the seatback reclined too far
can take off weight from the seat
cushion and affect the decision of the front
passenger sensing system, resulting in
serious injury or death in a crash. Always
sit upright against your seatback, with your
feet on the floor.
To reduce the risk of possible serious
injury: Do not stow objects in the
seatback map pocket (if equipped)
or hang objects off the seatback if a child
is in the front passenger seat. Do not place
objects underneath the front passenger
WARNINGS
seat or between the seat and the center
console (if equipped). Check the passenger
airbag off indicator lamp for proper airbag
status. Failure to follow these instructions
may interfere with the passenger seat
sensing system.
Any alteration or modification to the
front passenger seat may affect the
performance of the front passenger
sensing system which could seriously
increase the risk of injury or death.
This system works with sensors that are
part of the front passenger seat and safety
belt to detect the presence of a
properly-seated occupant and determine
if the front passenger frontal airbag should
be enabled (may inflate) or not.
E188175
The front passenger sensing system uses
a passenger airbag status indicator that
illuminates indicating that the front
passenger frontal airbag is either ON
(enabled) or OFF (disabled).
The indicator lamp is located in the center
stack of the instrument panel.
Note:The passenger airbag status indicator
OFF and ON indicator lamps illuminate for
a short period of time when the ignition is
first turned on to confirm it is functional.
38
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Supplementary Restraints System
The front passenger sensing system is
designed to disable (will not inflate) the
front passenger frontal airbag when the
front passenger seat is unoccupied, or a
rear facing infant seat, a forward-facing
child restraint, or a booster seat is
detected. Even with this technology,
parents are strongly encouraged to
always properly restrain children in the rear
seat. The sensor also turns off the
passenger front airbag and seat-mounted
side airbag when the passenger seat is
empty.
• When the front passenger sensing
system disables (will not inflate) the
front passenger frontal airbag, the
passenger airbag status indicator
illuminates the OFF lamp and stays lit
to remind you that the front passenger
frontal airbag is disabled.
• If the child restraint has been installed
and the passenger airbag status
indicator illuminates the ON lamp, then
turn the vehicle off, remove the child
restraint from the vehicle and reinstall
the restraint following the child
restraint manufacturer's instructions.
The front passenger sensing system is
designed to enable (may inflate) the front
passenger's frontal airbag anytime the
system senses that a person of adult size
is sitting properly in the front passenger
seat.
• When the front passenger sensing
system enables the front passenger
frontal airbag (may inflate), the
passenger airbag status indicator
illuminates the ON lamp and remains
illuminated.
If a person of adult size is sitting in the front
passenger seat, but the airbag off indicator
lamp is lit, it is possible that the person is
not sitting properly in the seat. If this
happens:
• Turn the vehicle off and ask the person
to place the seatback in the full upright
position.
• Have the person sit upright in the seat,
centered on the seat cushion, with the
person’s legs comfortably extended.
• Restart the vehicle and have the person
remain in this position for about two
minutes. This allows the system to
detect that person and enable the
passenger’s frontal airbag.
• If the indicator OFF lamp remains lit
even after this, the person should be
advised to ride in the rear seat.

If you think that the status of the passenger
airbag indicator lamp is incorrect, check
for the following:
• Objects lodged underneath the seat.
• Objects between the seat cushion and
the center console.
• Objects hanging off the seatback.
• Objects stowed in the seatback map
pocket.
• Objects placed on the occupant’s lap.
• Cargo interference with the seat.
• Other passengers pushing or pulling on
the seat.
• Rear passenger feet and knees resting
or pushing on the seat.
The conditions listed above may cause the
weight of a properly seated occupant to
be incorrectly interpreted by the front
passenger sensing system. The person in
the front passenger seat may appear
heavier or lighter due to the conditions
described in the list above.
Make sure the front passenger
sensing system is operating
properly, See Crash Sensors
and Airbag Indicator (page 43).
If the airbag readiness lamp is lit, do
the following:
The driver or adult passengers should
check for any objects that may be lodged
underneath the front passenger seat or
cargo interfering with the seat.
If objects are lodged or cargo is interfering
with the seat, please take the following
steps to remove the obstruction:
• Pull the vehicle over.
• Turn the vehicle off.
• Driver or adult passengers should
check for any objects lodged
underneath the front passenger seat
or cargo interfering with the seat.
• Remove the obstruction(s) (if found).
• Restart the vehicle.
• Wait at least two minutes and verify
that the airbag readiness lamp is no
longer illuminated
• If the airbag readiness lamp remains
illuminated, this may or may not be a
problem due to the front passenger
sensing system.
Do not attempt to repair or service the
system. Take your vehicle immediately to
an authorized dealer.
If it is necessary to modify an advanced
front airbag system to accommodate a
person with disabilities, contact the Ford
Customer Relationship Center. See

SIDE AIRBAGS
WARNINGS
Do not place objects or mount
equipment on or near the airbag
cover, on the side of the seatbacks
(of the front seats), or in front seat areas
that may come into contact with a
deploying airbag. Failure to follow these
instructions may increase the risk of
personal injury in the event of a crash.
40
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Supplementary Restraints System
WARNINGS
Do not use accessory seat covers.
The use of accessory seat covers
may prevent the deployment of the
side airbags and increase the risk of injury
in an accident.
Do not lean your head on the door.
The side airbag could injure you as it
deploys from the side of the
seatback.
Do not attempt to service, repair, or
modify the airbag, its fuses or the
seat cover on a seat containing an
airbag as you could be seriously injured or
killed. Contact your authorized dealer as
soon as possible.
If the side airbag has deployed, the
airbag will not function again. The
side airbag system (including the
seat) must be inspected and serviced by
an authorized dealer. If the airbag is not
replaced, the unrepaired area will increase
the risk of injury in a crash.
The side airbags are located on the
outboard side of the seatbacks of the front
seats. In certain sideways crashes, the
airbag on the side affected by the crash
will be inflated. The airbag was designed
to inflate between the door panel and
occupant to further enhance the protection
provided occupants in side impact crashes.
E152533
The system consists of the following:
• A label or embossed side panel
indicating that side airbags are fitted
to your vehicle.
• Side airbags located inside the driver
and front passenger seatbacks.
• Front passenger sensing system.
• Crash sensors and monitoring system
with readiness indicator. See Crash
Sensors and Airbag Indicator (page
43).
Note: The passenger sensing system will
deactivate the passenger seat-mounted
side airbag if it detects an empty passenger
seat.
The design and development of the side
airbag system included recommended
testing procedures that were developed
by a group of automotive safety experts
known as the Side Airbag Technical
Working Group. These recommended
testing procedures help reduce the risk of
injuries related to the deployment of side
airbags.
DRIVER KNEE AIRBAG
A driver's knee airbag is located under the
instrument panel. During a crash, the
restraints control module may activate the
driver's knee airbag based on crash severity
and occupant conditions. Under certain
crash and occupant conditions, the driver’s
knee airbag may deploy but the driver’s
front airbag may not activate. As with front
and side airbags, it is important to be
properly seated and restrained to reduce
the risk of death or serious injury.
Make sure the knee airbag is
operating properly. See Crash
Sensors and Airbag Indicator
(page 43).

SAFETY CANOPY™
WARNINGS
Do not place objects or mount
equipment on or near the headliner
at the siderail that may come into
contact with a deploying curtain airbag.
Failure to follow these instructions may
increase the risk of personal injury in the
event of a crash.
Do not lean your head on the door.
The curtain airbag could injure you
as it deploys from the headliner.
Do not attempt to service, repair, or
modify the curtain airbags, its fuses,
the A, B, or C pillar trim, or the
headliner on a vehicle containing curtain
airbags as you could be seriously injured
or killed. Contact your authorized dealer
as soon as possible.
All occupants of your vehicle
including the driver should always
wear their safety belts even when an
airbag supplemental restraint system and
curtain airbag is provided. Failure to
properly wear your safety belt could
seriously increase the risk of injury or death.
To reduce risk of injury, do not
obstruct or place objects in the
deployment path of the curtain
airbag.
If the curtain airbags have deployed,
the curtain airbags will not function
again. The curtain airbags (including
the A, B and C pillar trim and headliner)
must be inspected and serviced by an
authorized dealer. If the curtain airbag is
not replaced, the unrepaired area will
increase the risk of injury in a crash.
The Safety Canopy will deploy during
significant side crashes or when a certain
likelihood of a rollover event is detected
by the rollover sensor. The Safety Canopy
is mounted to the roof side-rail sheet
metal, behind the headliner, above each
row of seats. In certain sideways crashes
or rollover events, the Safety Canopy will
be activated, regardless of which seats are
occupied. The Safety Canopy is designed
to inflate between the side window area
and occupants to further enhance
protection provided in side impact crashes
and rollover events.
E75004
The system consists of the following:
• Safety canopy curtain airbags located
above the trim panels over the front
and rear side windows identified by a
label or wording on the headliner or
roof-pillar trim.
• A flexible headliner which opens above
the side doors to allow air curtain
deployment

Children 12 years old and under should
always be properly restrained in the rear
seats. The Safety Canopy will not interfere
with children restrained using a properly
installed child or booster seat because it
is designed to inflate downward from the
headliner above the doors along the side
window opening.
The design and development of the Safety
Canopy included recommended testing
procedures that were developed by a
group of automotive safety experts known
as the Side Airbag Technical Working
Group. These recommended testing
procedures help reduce the risk of injuries
related to the deployment of side airbags
(including the Safety Canopy).
CRASH SENSORS AND
AIRBAG INDICATOR
WARNING
Modifying or adding equipment to
the front end of your vehicle
(including frame, bumper, front end
body structure and tow hooks) may affect
the performance of the airbag system,
increasing the risk of injury. Do not modify
the front end of your vehicle.
Your vehicle has a collection of crash and
occupant sensors which provide
information to the restraints control
module which deploys (activates) the
front safety belt pretensioners, driver
airbag, passenger airbag, knee airbag(s),
seat mounted side airbags, and the Safety
Canopy. Based on the type of accident
(frontal impact, side impact or rollover)
the restraints control module will deploy
the appropriate safety devices.
The restraints control module also
monitors the readiness of the above safety
devices plus the crash and occupant
sensors. A warning indicator light in the
instrument cluster indicates the readiness
of the safety system. If this warning
indicator light is not functioning and there
is another fault within the system, the
message cluster may display an airbag
failure warning. See Information
Displays (page 91). You will hear five
tones that repeat periodically until you
repair the problem, the warning indicator
light or both. Routine maintenance of the
airbag is not required.
A difficulty with the system is indicated by
one or more of the following:
• The readiness light will not illuminate
immediately after the ignition is turned
on.
• The readiness light will either flash or
stay lit.
• A series of five beeps will be heard. The
tone pattern will repeat periodically
until the problem, the light or both are
repaired.
If any of these things happen, even
intermittently, have the supplemental
restraint system serviced at an authorized
dealer immediately. Unless serviced, the
system may not function properly in the
event of a crash.
The safety belt pretensioners and the
airbag supplemental restraint system is
designed to activate when your vehicle
sustains frontal or sideways deceleration
sufficient to cause the restraints control
module to deploy a safety device or when
a certain likelihood of a rollover event is
detected by the rollover sensor.
43
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Supplementary Restraints System
The fact that the safety belt pretensioners
or airbags did not activate for both front
seat occupants in a crash does not mean
that something is wrong with the system.
Rather, it means the restraints control
module determined the accident
conditions (for example, crash severity,
belt usage) were not appropriate to
activate these safety devices.
• The design of the front airbags is to
activate only in frontal and near-frontal
crashes (not rollovers, side impacts or
rear impacts) unless the crash causes
sufficient frontal deceleration.
• The safety belt pretensioners are
designed to activate in frontal,
near-frontal, side and rollover crashes.
• The design of the side airbags is to
inflate in certain side crashes. Side
airbags may activate in other types of
crashes if the vehicle experiences
sufficient sideways motion or
deformation.
• The knee airbag(s) may deploy based
on crash severity and occupant
conditions.
• The design of the Safety Canopy is to
inflate in certain side impact crashes
and when a certain likelihood of
rollover is detected by the rollover
sensor. The Safety Canopy may
activate in other types of crashes if the
vehicle experiences sufficient sideways
motion or deformation, or a certain
likelihood of rollover.

PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION
MyKey allows you to program keys with
restricted driving modes to promote good
driving habits. All but one of the keys can
be activated with these restricted modes.
Any keys that remain unprogrammed are
referred to as administrator keys or admin
keys. They can be used to:
• Create a MyKey.
• Program configurable MyKey settings.
• Clear all MyKey features.
When you have created a MyKey, you can
access the following information by using
the information display to determine:
• How many admin keys and MyKeys are
programmed to your vehicle.
• The total distance your vehicle traveled
with a MyKey.
Note: Switch the ignition on to use the
system.
Note: All MyKeys are programmed to the
same settings. You cannot program them
individually.
Note: For vehicles equipped with a
push-button start, when both a MyKey and
an admin key are present, the admin key will
be recognized by the vehicle when you start
the vehicle.
Non-configurable Settings
The following settings cannot be changed
by an admin key user:
• Safety belt reminder. You cannot
disable this feature. The audio system
will mute when the front seat
passengers’ safety belts are not
fastened.
• Early low fuel. The low-fuel warning
activates earlier, giving the MyKey user
more time to refuel.
• Driver assist features, if equipped on
your vehicle, are forced on: parking aid,
forward collision warning, lane
departure warning and Blind Spot
Information System (BLIS) with cross
traffic alert.
• Satellite radio adult content
restrictions, if equipped on your vehicle.
Configurable Settings
With an admin key, you can configure
certain MyKey settings when you first
create a MyKey and before you recycle the
key or restart the engine. You can also
change the settings afterward with an
admin key.
• A vehicle speed limit can be set.
Warnings will be shown in the display
followed by an audible tone when your
vehicle reaches the set speed. You
cannot override the set speed by fully
depressing the accelerator pedal or by
setting cruise control.
WARNING
Do not set MyKey maximum speed
limit to a limit that will prevent the
driver from maintaining a safe speed
considering posted speed limits and
prevailing road conditions. The driver is
always responsible to drive in accordance
with local laws and prevailing conditions.
Failure to do so could result in accident or
injury.

• Various vehicle speed minders can be
set. Once you select a speed, it will be
shown in the display, followed by an
audible tone when the preselected
vehicle speed is exceeded.
• Audio system maximum volume of
45%. A message will be shown in the
display when you attempt to exceed
the limited volume. Also, the
speed-sensitive or compensated
automatic volume control will be
disabled.
• Always on setting. When this is
selected, you will not be able to turn
off AdvanceTrac or traction control,

GENERAL INFORMATION
Condensation in Lamp Assemblies
Exterior lamps have vents to
accommodate normal changes in air
pressure.
Condensation can be a natural by-product
of this design. When moist air enters the
lamp assembly through the vents, there is
a possibility that condensation can occur
when the temperature is cold. When
normal condensation occurs, a fine mist
can form on the interior of the lens. The
fine mist eventually clears and exits
through the vents during normal operation.
Clearing time may take as long as 48 hours
under dry weather conditions.
Examples of acceptable condensation are:
• The presence of a fine mist (no streaks,
drip marks or large droplets).
• A fine mist covers less than 50% of the
lens.
Examples of unacceptable condensation
are:
• A water puddle inside the lamp.
• Streaks, drip marks or large droplets
present on the interior of the lens.
If you see any unacceptable condensation,
have your vehicle checked by an authorized
dealer.

AUTOMATIC HIGH BEAM
CONTROL (If Equipped)
The system automatically turns on the high
beams if it is dark enough and no other
traffic is present. When it detects the
headlights of an approaching vehicle, the
rear lamps of the preceding vehicle or
street lighting, the system turns off the high
beams before they distract other drivers.
The low beams remain on.
Note: If it appears that automatic high
beam is not functioning properly, check the
windshield in front of the camera for a
blockage. A clear view of the road is required
for proper system operation. Make sure that
authorized personnel repair any windshield
damage in the area of the camera's field of
view.
Note:If the system detects a blockage such
as bird droppings, bug splatter, snow or ice,
and you do not observe changes, the system
may go into low beam mode until you clear
the blockage. A message may also appear
in the information display noting the front
camera is blocked.
Note: Typical road dust, dirt and water
spots do not affect the performance of the
automatic high beam control. However, in
cold or inclement weather conditions, you
may notice a decrease in the availability of
the automatic high beam control, especially
at start up. If you want to change the beam
state independently of the system, you may
switch the high beams on or off using the
lighting control switch. Automatic high
beam control resumes when conditions are
correct.
Note: Modification of your vehicle ride
height such as using much larger tires, may
degrade feature performance.
A camera sensor, centrally mounted
behind the windshield of your vehicle,
continuously monitors conditions to decide
when to switch the high beams off and on.
Once the system is active, the high beams
switch on if:
• The ambient light level is low enough.
• There is no traffic in front of the vehicle.
• The vehicle speed is greater than
31 mph (50 km/h).
The high beams switch off if:
• The system detects the headlamps of
an approaching vehicle or the rear
lamps of a preceding vehicle.
• Vehicle speed falls below 26 mph
(42 km/h).
• The ambient light level is high enough
that high beams are not required.
• The system detects severe rain, snow
or fog.
• The camera is blocked.

WARNING
Never remove the coolant reservoir
cap while the engine is running or hot.
At normal operating temperature, the
needle remains in the center section.
Note: Do not restart the engine until the
cause of overheating has been determined
and resolved.
86
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Instrument Cluster
If the needle enters the red section, the
engine is overheating. Stop the engine,
switch the ignition off and determine the
cause once the engine has cooled down.
See Engine Coolant Check (page 217).
Fuel Gauge
Note: : The fuel gauge may vary slightly
when your vehicle is moving or on a gradient.
Switch the ignition on. The fuel gauge will
indicate approximately how much fuel is
left in the fuel tank. The arrow adjacent to
the fuel pump symbol indicates on which
side of your vehicle the fuel filler door is
located.
The needle should move toward F when
you refuel your vehicle. If the needle points
to E after adding fuel, this indicates your
vehicle needs service soon.
After refueling some variability in needle
position is normal.
Note: It may take a short time for the
needle to reach F after leaving the gas
station. This is normal and depends upon
the slope of pavement at the gas station.
Note: The fuel amount dispensed into the
tank is a little less or more than the gauge
indicated. This is normal and depends upon
the slope of pavement at the gas station.
Note: If the gas station nozzle shuts off
before the tank is full, try a different gas
pump nozzle.

HINTS ON CONTROLLING THE
INTERIOR CLIMATE
General Hints
Note:Prolonged use of recirculated air may
cause the windows to fog up.
Note: To reduce humidity build-up inside
your vehicle, do not drive with the system
switched off or with recirculated air always
switched on.
Note: Do not place objects under the front
seats as this may interfere with the airflow
to the rear seats.
Note: Remove any snow, ice or leaves from
the air intake area at the base of the
windshield.
Note:To improve the time to reach comfort
in hot weather, drive with the windows fully
open until you feel cold air through the air
vents.
Manual Climate Control
Note: To reduce fogging of the windshield
during humid weather, adjust the air
distribution control to the windshield air
vents position.
Automatic Climate Control
Note: Adjusting the settings when your
vehicle interior is extremely hot or cold is
not necessary. The system automatically
adjusts to heat or cool the cabin to your
selected temperature as quickly as possible.
For the system to function efficiently, the
instrument panel and side air vents should
be fully open.
Note: If you select AUTO during cold
outside temperatures, the system directs
airflow to the windshield and side window
vents. In addition, the fan may run at a
slower speed until the engine warms up.
Note:If you select AUTO during hot outside
temperatures, or when the inside of the
vehicle is hot, the system automatically uses
recirculated air to maximize interior cooling.
When the interior reaches the selected
temperature, the system automatically
switches to using outside air.

CABIN AIR FILTER
Your vehicle is equipped with a cabin air
filter, which gives you and your passengers
the following benefits:
• It improves your driving comfort by
reducing particle concentration.
• It improves the interior compartment
cleanliness.
• It protects the climate control
components from particle deposits.
You can locate the cabin air filter behind
the glove box.
Note: Make sure you have a cabin air filter
installed at all times. This prevents foreign
objects from entering the system. Running
the system without a filter in place could
result in degradation or damage to the
system.
Replace the filter at regular intervals. See
Scheduled Maintenance (page 336).

SITTING IN THE CORRECT
POSITION
WARNINGS
Do not recline the seat backrest too
far as this can cause the occupant
to slide under the safety belt,
resulting in serious injury in the event of a
crash.
Sitting improperly, out of position or
with the seat backrest reclined too
far, can result in serious injury or
death in the event of a crash. Always sit
upright against your seat backrest, with
your feet on the floor.
Do not place objects higher than the
seat backrest to reduce the risk of
serious injury in the event of a crash
or during heavy braking.
E68595
When you use them properly, the seat,
head restraint, safety belt and airbags will
provide optimum protection in the event

GENERAL INFORMATION
WARNINGS
Extended idling at high engine
speeds can produce very high
temperatures in the engine and
exhaust system, creating the risk of fire or
other damage.
Do not park, idle or drive your vehicle
on dry grass or other dry ground
cover. The emission system heats up
the engine compartment and exhaust
system, creating the risk of fire.
Do not start the engine in a closed
garage or in other enclosed areas.
Exhaust fumes can be toxic. Always
open the garage door before you start the
engine.
If you smell exhaust fumes inside
your vehicle, have your vehicle
checked by an authorized dealer
immediately. Do not drive your vehicle if
you smell exhaust fumes.
If you disconnect the battery, your vehicle
may exhibit some unusual driving
characteristics for approximately 5 miles
(8 kilometers) after you reconnect it. This
is because the engine management system
must realign itself with the engine. You can
disregard any unusual driving
characteristics during this period.
The powertrain control system meets all
Canadian interference-causing equipment
standard requirements regulating the
impulse electrical field or radio noise.

Guarding Against Exhaust Fumes
WARNING
If you smell exhaust fumes inside
your vehicle, have your vehicle
checked by your authorized dealer
immediately. Do not drive your vehicle if
you smell exhaust fumes. Carbon
monoxide is present in exhaust fumes.
Take precautions to avoid its dangerous
effects.
Important Ventilating Information
If you stop your vehicle and then leave the
engine idling for long periods, we
recommend that you do one of the
following:
• Open the windows at least 1.0 in
(2.5 cm).
• Set your climate control to outside air.
ENGINE BLOCK HEATER (If
Equipped)
WARNINGS
Failure to follow engine block heater
instructions could result in property
damage or serious personal injury.
Do not use your heater with
ungrounded electrical systems or
two-pronged adapters. There is a risk
of electrical shock.
Do not fully close the hood, or allow
it to drop under its own weight when
using the engine block heater. This
could damage the power cable and may
cause an electrical short resulting in fire,
injury and property damage.
Note: The heater is most effective when
outdoor temperatures are below 0°F
(-18°C).
The heater acts as a starting aid by
warming the engine coolant. This allows
the climate control system to respond
quickly. The equipment includes a heater
element (installed in the engine block) and
a wire harness. You can connect the
system to a grounded 120-volt AC
electrical source.
We recommend that you do the following
for a safe and correct operation:
• Use a 16-gauge outdoor extension cord
that is product certified by
Underwriter’s Laboratory (UL) or
Canadian Standards Association
(CSA). This extension cord must be
suitable for use outdoors, in cold
temperatures, and be clearly marked
Suitable for Use with Outdoor
Appliances. Do not use an indoor
extension cord outdoors. This could
result in an electric shock or become a
fire hazard.
• Use as short an extension cord as
possible.
• Do not use multiple extension cords.
• Make sure that when in operation, the
extension cord plug and heater cord
plug connections are free and clear of
water. This could cause an electric
shock or fire.
• Make sure your vehicle is parked in a
clean area, clear of combustibles.
• Make sure the heater, heater cord and
extension cord are firmly connected.
• Check for heat anywhere in the
electrical hookup once the system has
been operating for approximately 30
minutes.
124
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Starting and Stopping the Engine
• Make sure the system is unplugged and
properly stowed before starting and
driving your vehicle. Make sure the
protective cover seals the prongs of the
block heater cord plug when not in use.
• Make sure the heater system is
checked for proper operation before
winter.
Using the Engine Block Heater
Make sure the receptacle terminals are
clean and dry prior to use. Clean them with
a dry cloth if necessary.
The heater uses 0.4 to 1.0 kilowatt-hours
of energy per hour of use. The system does
not have a thermostat. It achieves
maximum temperature after
approximately three hours of operation.
Using the heater longer than three hours
does not improve system performance and
unnecessarily uses electricity.

SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
WARNINGS
Do not overfill the fuel tank. The
pressure in an overfilled tank may
cause leakage and lead to fuel spray
and fire.
The fuel system may be under
pressure. If you hear a hissing sound
near the fuel filler door (Easy Fuel
capless fuel system), do not refuel until
the sound stops. Otherwise, fuel may spray
out, which could cause serious personal
injury.
Automotive fuels can cause serious
injury or death if misused or
mishandled.
Flow of fuel through a fuel pump
nozzle can produce static electricity.
This can cause a fire if you are filling
an ungrounded fuel container.
Fuel ethanol and gasoline may
contain benzene, which is a
cancer-causing agent.
When refueling always shut the
engine off and never allow sparks or
open flames near the filler neck.
Never smoke or use a cell phone while
refueling. Fuel vapor is extremely
hazardous under certain conditions. Avoid
inhaling excess fumes.
Observe the following guidelines when
handling automotive fuel:
• Extinguish all smoking materials and
any open flames before refueling your
vehicle.
• Always turn off the vehicle before
refueling.
• Automotive fuels can be harmful or
fatal if swallowed. Fuel such as
gasoline is highly toxic and if
swallowed can cause death or
permanent injury. If fuel is swallowed,
call a physician immediately, even if no
symptoms are immediately apparent.
The toxic effects of fuel may not be
visible for hours.
• Avoid inhaling fuel vapors. Inhaling too
much fuel vapor of any kind can lead
to eye and respiratory tract irritation.
In severe cases, excessive or prolonged
breathing of fuel vapor can cause
serious illness and permanent injury.
• Avoid getting fuel liquid in your eyes. If
fuel is splashed in the eyes, remove
contact lenses (if worn), flush with
water for 15 minutes and seek medical
attention. Failure to seek proper
medical attention could lead to
permanent injury.
• Fuels can also be harmful if absorbed
through the skin. If fuel is splashed on
the skin, clothing or both, promptly
remove contaminated clothing and
wash skin thoroughly with soap and
water. Repeated or prolonged skin
contact with fuel liquid or vapor causes
skin irritation.
• Be particularly careful if you are taking
“Antabuse” or other forms of disulfiram
for the treatment of alcoholism.
Breathing gasoline vapors, or skin
contact could cause an adverse
reaction. In sensitive individuals, serious
personal injury or sickness may result.
If fuel is splashed on the skin, promptly
wash skin thoroughly with soap and
water. Consult a physician immediately
if you experience an adverse reaction.

FUEL QUALITY - GASOLINE
Choosing the Right Fuel
E161513
We recommend regular unleaded gasoline
with a pump (R+M)/2 octane rating of 87.
Some fuel stations offer fuels posted as
regular unleaded gasoline with an octane
rating below 87, particularly in high altitude
areas. We do not recommend fuels with
an octane rating below 87.
For vehicles with EcoBoost engines, to
provide improved performance, we
recommend premium fuel for severe duty
usage such as trailer tow.
Do not use any fuel other than those
recommended because they could lead to
engine damage that may not be covered
by the vehicle Warranty.
Note: Use of any fuel other than those
recommended can impair the emission
control system and cause a loss of vehicle
performance.
Do not use:
• Diesel fuel.
• Fuels containing kerosene or paraffin.
• Fuel containing more than 15% ethanol
or E85 fuel.
• Fuels containing methanol.
• Fuels containing metallic-based
additives, including manganese-based
compounds.
• Fuels containing the octane booster
additive, methylcyclopentadienyl
manganese tricarbonyl (MMT).
• Leaded fuel (using leaded fuel is
prohibited by law).
The use of fuels with metallic compounds
such as methylcyclopentadienyl
manganese tricarbonyl (commonly known
as MMT), which is a manganese-based

FUEL FILLER FUNNEL
LOCATION
The fuel filler funnel is located in the spare
wheel storage tray.
RUNNING OUT OF FUEL
Running out of fuel can cause damage not
covered by the vehicle Warranty.
If your vehicle runs out of fuel:
• Add a minimum of 1.3 gal (5 L) of fuel
to restart the engine. If your vehicle is
out of fuel and on a steep slope, more
fuel may be required.
• You may need to switch the ignition
from off to on several times after
refueling to allow the fuel system to
pump the fuel from the tank to the
engine. When restarting, cranking time
takes a few seconds longer than
normal.
Filling a Portable Fuel Container
Use the following guidelines to avoid
electrostatic charge build-up when filling
an ungrounded fuel container:
• Only use an approved fuel container to
transfer fuel to your vehicle. Place the
container on the ground when filling it.
• Do not fill a fuel container when it is
inside your vehicle (including the cargo
area).
• Keep the fuel pump nozzle in contact
with the fuel container when filling it.
• Do not use a device that holds the fuel
pump nozzle lever in the fill position.
Adding Fuel From a Portable Fuel
Container
WARNINGS
Do not insert the nozzle of a fuel
container or an aftermarket funnel
into the fuel system filler neck. This
may damage the fuel system filler neck or

hazardous under certain conditions. Avoid
inhaling excess fumes.
Stay outside your vehicle and do not
leave the fuel pump unattended
when refueling your vehicle. This is
against the law in some places.
Keep children away from the fuel
pump; never let children pump fuel.
Wait at least 10 seconds before
removing the fuel pump nozzle to
allow any residual fuel to drain into
the fuel tank.
Stop refueling after the fuel pump
nozzle automatically shuts off for the
second time. Failure to follow this
will fill the expansion space in the fuel tank
and could lead to fuel overflowing.

Note: A fuel spillage concern may occur if
overfilling the fuel tank. Do not overfill the
tank. The fill pipe is equipped with a drain
hole. Excess fuel due to overfill may drain
through the drain hole and drip onto the
ground.
If the fuel fill inlet was not properly closed,
a service engine warning lamp may appear
on the instrument cluster.
At the next opportunity, do the following:
132
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Fuel and Refueling
1. Stop your vehicle as soon as safely
possible and shift the transmission into
park (P).
2. Switch the ignition off.
3. Open the fuel filler door and remove
any visible debris from the fuel fill
opening.
4. Insert either the fuel fill nozzle or the
fuel fill funnel provided with the vehicle
several times to allow the inlet to close
properly. This will dislodge any debris
preventing the inlet from sealing.
If this action corrects the problem, the
message may not reset immediately. It
may take several driving cycles for the
message to turn off. A driving cycle
consists of an engine start-up (after 4 or
more hours with the engine off) followed
by city or highway driving. Continuing to
drive with the message on may cause the
service engine soon lamp to turn on as
well.
FUEL CONSUMPTION
Note: The amount of usable fuel in the
empty reserve varies and should not be
relied upon to increase driving range. When
refueling your vehicle after the fuel gauge
indicates empty, you might not be able to
refuel the full amount of the advertised
capacity of the fuel tank due to the empty
reserve still present in the tank.
Empty reserve is the amount of fuel
remaining in the tank after the fuel gauge
indicates empty. Do not rely on this fuel for
driving. The usable capacity of the fuel
tank is the amount of fuel that can be put
into the tank after the gauge indicates
empty. The advertised capacity is the total
fuel tank size – it is the combined usable
capacity plus the empty reserve.
Filling the Tank
For consistent results when filling the fuel
tank:
• Turn the ignition off before fueling; an
inaccurate reading results if the engine
is left running.
• Use the same fill rate
(low-medium-high) each time the tank
is filled.
• Allow no more than two automatic
click-offs when filling.
Results are most accurate when the filling
method is consistent.
Calculating Fuel Economy
Do not measure fuel economy during the
first 1000 miles (1600 kilometers) of
driving (this is your engine’s break-in
period); a more accurate measurement is
obtained after 2000 miles - 3000 miles
(3200 kilometers - 4800 kilometers). Also,
fuel expense, frequency of fill ups or fuel
gauge readings are not accurate ways to
measure fuel economy.
1. Fill the fuel tank completely and record
the initial odometer reading.
2. Each time you fill the tank, record the
amount of fuel added.
3. After at least three to five tank fill ups,
fill the fuel tank and record the current
odometer reading.
4. Subtract your initial odometer reading
from the current odometer reading.
5. Calculate fuel economy by dividing
miles traveled by gallons used (For
Metric: Multiply liters used by 100, then
divide by kilometers traveled).
133
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Fuel and Refueling
Keep a record for at least one month and
record the type of driving (city or highway).
This provides an accurate estimate of the
vehicle’s fuel economy under current
driving conditions. Additionally, keeping
records during summer and winter show
how temperature impacts fuel economy.
In general, lower temperatures mean lower
fuel economy.
EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEM
WARNINGS
Do not park, idle, or drive your vehicle
in dry grass or other dry ground cover.
The emission system heats up the
engine compartment and exhaust system,
which can start a fire.
Exhaust leaks may result in entry of
harmful and potentially lethal fumes
into the passenger compartment. If
you smell exhaust fumes inside your
vehicle, have your dealer inspect your
vehicle immediately. Do not drive if you
smell exhaust fumes.
Your vehicle is equipped with various
emission control components and a
catalytic converter that will enable your
vehicle to comply with applicable exhaust
emission standards. To make sure that the
catalytic converter and other emission
control components continue to work
properly:
• Use only the specified fuel listed.
• Avoid running out of fuel.
• Do not turn off the ignition while your
vehicle is moving, especially at high
speeds.
• Have the items listed in scheduled
maintenance information performed
according to the specified schedule.
The scheduled maintenance items listed
in scheduled maintenance information are
essential to the life and performance of
your vehicle and to its emissions system.
If you use parts other than Ford, Motorcraft
or Ford-authorized parts for maintenance
replacements, or for service of
components affecting emission control,
such non-Ford parts should be the
equivalent to genuine Ford Motor Company
parts in performance and durability.
Illumination of the service engine soon
indicator, charging system warning light or
the temperature warning light, fluid leaks,
strange odors, smoke or loss of engine
power could indicate that the emission
control system is not working properly.
An improperly operating or damaged
exhaust system may allow exhaust to
enter the vehicle. Have a damaged or
improperly operating exhaust system
inspected and repaired immediately.
Do not make any unauthorized changes to
your vehicle or engine. By law, vehicle
owners and anyone who manufactures,
repairs, services, sells, leases, trades
vehicles, or supervises a fleet of vehicles
are not permitted to intentionally remove
an emission control device or prevent it
from working. Information about your
vehicle’s emission system is on the Vehicle
Emission Control Information Decal
located on or near the engine. This decal
also lists engine displacement
Please consult your warranty information
for complete details.
134
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Fuel and Refueling
On-Board Diagnostics (OBD-II)
Your vehicle has a computer known as the
on-board diagnostics system (OBD-II) that
monitors the engine’s emission control
system. The system protects the
environment by making sure that your
vehicle continues to meet government
emission standards. The OBD-II system
also assists a service technician in properly
servicing your vehicle.
When the service engine soon
indicator illuminates, the OBD-II
system has detected a
malfunction. Temporary malfunctions may
cause the service engine soon indicator to
illuminate.
Examples of temporary malfunctions are:
• the vehicle has run out of fuel—the
engine may misfire or run poorly
• poor fuel quality or water in the
fuel—the engine may misfire or run
poorly
• the fuel fill inlet may not have closed
properly. See Refueling (page 131).
• driving through deep water—the
electrical system may be wet.
You can correct these temporary
malfunctions by filling the fuel tank with
good quality fuel, properly closing the fuel
fill inlet or letting the electrical system dry
out. After three driving cycles without these
or any other temporary malfunctions
present, the service engine soon indicator
should stay off the next time you start the
engine. A driving cycle consists of a cold
engine startup followed by mixed
city/highway driving. No additional vehicle
service is required.
If the service engine soon indicator remains
on, have your vehicle serviced at the first
available opportunity. Although some
malfunctions detected by the OBD-II may
not have symptoms that are apparent,
continued driving with the service engine
soon indicator on can result in increased
emissions, lower fuel economy, reduced
engine and transmission smoothness, and
lead to more costly repairs.
Readiness for
Inspection/Maintenance (I/M)
Testing
Some state/provincial and local
governments may have
Inspection/Maintenance (I/M) programs
to inspect the emission control equipment
on your vehicle. Failure to pass this
inspection could prevent you from getting
a vehicle registration.
If the service engine soon
indicator is on or the bulb does
not work, you may need to have
the vehicle serviced. See On-Board
Diagnostics (OBD-II).
Your vehicle may not pass the I/M test if
the service engine soon indicator is on or
not working properly (bulb is burned out),
or if the OBD-II system has determined
that some of the emission control systems
have not been properly checked. In this
case, your vehicle is not ready for I/M
testing.
If the vehicle’s engine or transmission has
just been serviced, or the battery has
recently run down or been replaced, the
OBD-II system may indicate that the
vehicle is not ready for I/M testing. To
determine if the vehicle is ready for I/M
testing, turn the ignition key to the on
position for 15 seconds without cranking
135
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Fuel and Refueling
the engine. If the service engine soon
indicator blinks eight times, it means that
the vehicle is not ready for I/M testing; if
the service engine soon indicator stays on
solid, it means that the vehicle is ready for
I/M testing.
The OBD-II system monitors the emission
control system during normal driving. A
complete check may take several days. If
the vehicle is not ready for I/M testing, you
may need to perform the following driving
cycle consisting of mixed city and highway
driving:
Drive on an expressway or highway for a
steady 15 minutes, followed by 20 minutes
of stop-and-go driving with at least four
30-second idle periods.
Allow the vehicle to sit for at least eight
hours without starting the engine. Then,
start the engine and complete the above
driving cycle. The engine must warm up to
its normal operating temperature. Once
started, do not turn off the engine until the
above driving cycle is complete. If the
vehicle is still not ready for I/M testing, you
will have to repeat the above driving cycle.

WARNINGS
Do not apply the brake pedal and
accelerator pedal simultaneously.
Applying both pedals simultaneously
for more than three seconds will limit
engine rpm, which may result in difficulty
maintaining speed in traffic and could lead
to serious injury.
The PowerShift™ 6-speed, dual-clutch
automatic transmission is designed to offer
drivers both enhanced fuel efficiency and
fun to drive performance. This
transmission’s dual-clutch technology uses
electronically shifted clutches to operate
two separate transmissions all in a small
lightweight package.
Since the clutch and gear operation is
derived from a manual transmission, the
PowerShift automatic transmission will
drive, sound, and feel similar to manual
transmission minus the required
user-inputs. For example, the transmission
may exhibit mechanical noises, firm gear
shifts and/or light clutch vibrations when
accelerating slowly as the clutches
automatically engage. These are all
considered to be normal and expected
driving characteristics.
Understanding the Positions of
Your Automatic Transmission
Putting your vehicle in gear:
1. Fully press down the brake pedal.
2. Move the gearshift lever into the
desired gear.
3. Come to a complete stop.
4. Move the gearshift lever and securely
latch it in park (P).

prevents the wheels from turning.
Reverse (R)
With the gearshift lever in reverse (R), your
vehicle moves backward. Always come to
a complete stop before shifting into and
out of reverse (R).
Neutral (N)
With the gearshift lever in neutral (N), your
vehicle can be started and is free to roll.
Hold the brake pedal down while in this
position.
Drive (D)
Drive (D) is the normal driving position for
the best fuel economy. The overdrive
function allows automatic upshifts and
downshifts through gears one through six.

Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Transmission
Sport (S)
Moving the gearshift lever to sport (S):
• Provides additional grade (engine)
braking and extends lower gear
operation to enhance performance for
uphill climbs, hilly terrain or
mountainous areas. This increases
engine RPM during engine braking.
• Provides additional lower gear
operation through the automatic
transmission shift strategy.
• Gears are selected more quickly and
at higher engine speeds.
SelectShift Automatic™
Transmission (If Equipped)
Your vehicle is equipped with a SelectShift
Automatic transmission gearshift lever.
The SelectShift Automatic transmission
gives you the ability to change gears up or
down (without a clutch) as desired.
In order to prevent the engine from running
at too low an RPM, which may cause it to
stall, SelectShift still automatically makes
some downshifts if it has determined that
you have not downshifted in time.
Although SelectShift makes some
downshifts for you, it still allows you to
downshift at any time as long as the
SelectShift determines that damage will
not be caused to the engine from
over-revving.
Note: Engine damage may occur if you
maintain excessive engine revving without
shifting.
SelectShift does not automatically upshift,
even if the engine is approaching the RPM
limit. It must be shifted manually by
pressing the + button.
If equipped with the toggle on the
gearshift lever:
• Press the (+) button to upshift.
• Press the (-) button to downshift.
E142629
If equipped with steering wheel
paddles:
With your vehicle in drive (D), the paddle
shifters provide temporary manual control.
They allow you the ability to shift gears
quickly, without taking your hands off the
steering wheel.
You can achieve extensive manual control
by moving the gearshift lever to the sport
(S) position.
• Pull the right paddle (+) to upshift.
• Pull the left paddle (–) to downshift.
E144821
The system determines when temporary
manual control is no longer in use and
returns to automatic control.

Brake-Shift Interlock
WARNINGS
Do not drive your vehicle until you
verify that the brake lamps are
working.
When doing this procedure, you will
be taking your vehicle out of park (P)
which means your vehicle can roll
freely. To avoid unwanted vehicle
movement, always fully set the parking
brake prior to doing this procedure. Use
wheel chocks if appropriate.
If you fully release the parking brake
and the brake warning lamp remains
illuminated, the brakes may not be
working properly. See your authorized
dealer.
Note: For some markets this feature will be
disabled.
Your vehicle is equipped with a brake-shift
interlock feature that prevents moving the
gearshift lever from park (P) when the
ignition is in the on position and the brake
pedal is not pressed.
If you cannot move the gearshift lever out
of park (P) position with the ignition in the
on position and the brake pedal pressed,
a malfunction may have occurred. It is
possible that a fuse has blown or your
vehicle’s brake lamps are not operating
properly. See Fuse Specification Chart
(page 201).
If the fuse is not blown and the brake
lamps are working properly, the following
procedure will allow you to move the
gearshift lever from park (P):
E155984
1. Remove the side panel on the right side
of the gearshift lever.
E155985
2. Locate the access hole.

Automatic Transmission Adaptive
Learning
This feature may increase durability and
provide consistent shift feel over the life
of your vehicle. A new vehicle or
transmission may have firm shifts, soft
shifts or both. This operation is considered
normal and does not affect function or
durability of the transmission. Over time,
the adaptive learning process fully updates
transmission operation.
If Your Vehicle Gets Stuck In Mud
or Snow
Note: Do not rock the vehicle if the engine
is not at normal operating temperature or
damage to the transmission may occur.
Note: Do not rock the vehicle for more than
a minute or damage to the transmission and
tires may occur, or the engine may overheat.
If your vehicle gets stuck in mud or snow,
you may rock it out by shifting between
forward and reverse gears, stopping
between shifts in a steady pattern. Press
lightly on the accelerator in each gear.

GENERAL INFORMATION
Note: Occasional brake noise is normal. If
a metal-to-metal, continuous grinding or
continuous squeal sound is present, the
brake linings may be worn-out. Have the
system checked by an authorized dealer. If
your vehicle has continuous vibration or
shudder in the steering wheel while braking,
have it checked by an authorized dealer.
Note: Brake dust may accumulate on the
wheels, even under normal driving
conditions. Some dust is inevitable as the
brakes wear and does not contribute to
brake noise. See Cleaning the Alloy
Wheels (page 238).
Note: Depending on applicable laws and
regulations in the country for which your
vehicle was originally built, your brake lamps
may flash during heavy braking. Following
this, your hazard lights may also flash when
your vehicle comes to a stop.
E144522
See Warning Lamps and
Indicators (page 87).
Wet brakes result in reduced braking
efficiency. Gently press the brake pedal a
few times when driving from a car wash or
standing water to dry the brakes.
Brake Over Accelerator
In the event the accelerator pedal
becomes stuck or entrapped, apply steady
and firm pressure to the brake pedal to
slow the vehicle and reduce engine power.
If you experience this condition, apply the
brakes and bring your vehicle to a safe
stop. Move the transmission to park (P),
switch the engine off and apply the parking
brake. Inspect the accelerator pedal for
any interference. If none are found and the
condition persists, have your vehicle towed
to the nearest authorized dealer.
Brake Assist
Brake assist detects when you brake
rapidly by measuring the rate at which you
press the brake pedal. It provides
maximum braking efficiency as long as you
press the pedal, and can reduce stopping
distances in critical situations.
Anti-lock Brake System
This system helps you maintain steering
control during emergency stops by keeping
the brakes from locking.
This lamp momentarily
illuminates when you turn the
ignition on. If the light does not
illuminate during start up, remains on or
flashes, the system may be disabled. Have
the system checked by an authorized
dealer. If the anti-lock brake system is
disabled, normal braking is still effective.
E144522
If the brake warning lamp
illuminates when you release the
parking brake, have the system
checked by an authorized dealer.
HINTS ON DRIVING WITH
ANTI-LOCK BRAKES
Note: When the system is operating, the
brake pedal may pulse and may travel
further. Maintain pressure on the brake
pedal. You may also hear a noise from the
system. This is normal.
The anti-lock braking system will not
eliminate the risks when:
• You drive too closely to the vehicle in
front of you.
• Your vehicle is hydroplaning.
• You take corners too fast.
• The road surface is poor.

HILL START ASSIST
WARNINGS
The system does not replace the
parking brake. When you leave your
vehicle, always apply the parking
brake and shift the transmission into park
(P) for automatic transmission or first gear
for manual transmission.
You must remain in your vehicle once
you have activated the system.
During all times, you are responsible
for controlling your vehicle,
supervising the system and
intervening, if required.
If the engine is revved excessively, or
if a malfunction is detected, the
system will be deactivated.
The system makes it easier to pull away
when your vehicle is on a slope without the
need to use the parking brake.
When the system is active, your vehicle will
remain stationary on the slope for two to
three seconds after you release the brake
pedal. This allows you time to move your
foot from the brake to the accelerator
pedal. The brakes are released
automatically once the engine has
developed sufficient torque to prevent your
vehicle from rolling down the slope. This
is an advantage when pulling away on a
slope, for example from a car park ramp,
traffic lights or when reversing uphill into
a parking space.
145
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Brakes
The system will activate automatically on
any slope that will cause significant vehicle
rollback. For vehicles with a manual
transmission, you can switch this feature
off using the information display. See
Information Displays (page 91). The
system will remain on or off depending on
how it was last set.
Note: There is no warning lamp to indicate
the system is either on or off.
Using Hill Start Assist
1. Press the brake pedal to bring your
vehicle to a complete standstill. Keep
the brake pedal pressed and select an
uphill gear (for example, first (1) when

2. If the sensors detect that your vehicle
is on a slope, the system will activate
automatically.
3. When you remove your foot from the
brake pedal, your vehicle will remain
on the slope without rolling away for
about two or three seconds. This hold
time will automatically be extended if
you are in the process of driving off.
4. Drive off in the normal manner. The
brakes will release automatically.
Switching the System On and Off
Vehicles with Manual Transmission

Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Brakes
PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION
The traction control system helps avoid
drive wheel spin and loss of traction.
If your vehicle begins to slide, the system
applies the brakes to individual wheels
and, when needed, reduces engine power
at the same time. If the wheels spin when
accelerating on slippery or loose surfaces,
the system reduces engine power in order
to increase traction.
USING TRACTION CONTROL
WARNING
The stability and traction control
light illuminates steadily if the
system detects a failure. Make sure
you did not manually disable the traction
control system using the information
display controls or the switch. If the
stability control and traction control light
is still illuminating steadily, have the
system serviced by an authorized dealer
immediately. Operating your vehicle with
the traction control disabled could lead to
an increased risk of loss of vehicle control,
vehicle rollover, personal injury and death.
The system automatically turns on each
time you switch the ignition on.
If your vehicle is stuck in mud or snow,
switching traction control off may be
beneficial as this allows the wheels to spin.
Note:When you switch traction control off,
stability control remains fully active.
Switching the System Off
When you switch the system off or on, a
message appears in the information
display showing system status.
You can switch the system off by either
using the information display controls or

Traction Control
PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION
WARNINGS
Vehicle modifications involving
braking system, aftermarket roof
racks, suspension, steering system,
tire construction and wheel and tire size
may change the handling characteristics
of your vehicle and may adversely affect
the performance of the electronic stability
control system. In addition, installing any
stereo loudspeakers may interfere with
and adversely affect the electronic stability
control system. Install any aftermarket
stereo loudspeaker as far as possible from
the front center console, the tunnel, and
the front seats in order to minimize the risk
of interfering with the electronic stability
control sensors. Reducing the
effectiveness of the electronic stability
control system could lead to an increased
risk of loss of vehicle control, vehicle
rollover, personal injury and death.
Remember that even advanced
technology cannot defy the laws of
physics. It’s always possible to lose
control of a vehicle due to inappropriate
driver input for the conditions. Aggressive
driving on any road condition can cause
you to lose control of your vehicle
increasing the risk of personal injury or
property damage. Activation of the
electronic stability control system is an
indication that at least some of the tires
have exceeded their ability to grip the road;
this could reduce the operator’s ability to
control the vehicle potentially resulting in
a loss of vehicle control, vehicle rollover,
personal injury and death. If your electronic
stability control system activates, SLOW
DOWN.
The system automatically turns on each
time you switch the ignition on.
If a driving condition activates either the
stability control or the traction control
system you may experience the following
conditions:
• The stability and traction control light
flashes.
• Your vehicle slows down.
• Reduced engine power.
• A vibration in the brake pedal.
• The brake pedal is stiffer than usual.
• If the driving condition is severe and
your foot is not on the brake, the brake
pedal may move as the system applies
higher brake forces.
The stability control system has several
features built into it to help you maintain
control of your vehicle:
Electronic Stability Control
The system enhances your vehicle’s ability
to prevent skids or lateral slides by

PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION
WARNINGS
The system does not relieve you of
your responsibility to drive with due
care and attention.
If your vehicles has a non-Ford
approved trailer tow module the
system may not correctly detect
objects.
The sensors may not detect objects
in heavy rain or other conditions that
cause disruptive reflections.
The sensors may not detect objects
with surfaces that absorb ultrasonic
waves.
The system does not detect objects
that are moving away from your
vehicle. They will only be detected
shortly after they start to move toward
your vehicle.
Take particular care when reversing
with a tow ball arm or a rear fitted
accessory. For example, a bicycle
carrier. The rear parking aid will only
indicate the approximate distance from
the rear bumper to an object.
Sensing is only an aid to detect some
objects when moving forward or
backward at low speeds. Traffic
control systems, inclement weather or an
external motor and fan can affect the
sensors; this may include reduced
performance or false activation. To help
avoid personal injury you must read and
understand the limitations of the system
detailed in this section.
WARNINGS
The parking aid system may not
prevent contact with small or moving
objects that are close to the ground.
The parking aid system gives an audible
warning when it detects a large object
helping to avoid damage to your vehicle.
To help avoid personal injury you must take
care when using the parking aid system.
Note: If you use a high pressure spray to
wash your vehicle, only spray the sensors
briefly from a distance not less than 8 in
(20 cm).
Note: If your vehicle has a tow ball arm, the
system is turned off automatically when
trailer lamps (or lighting boards) are
connected to the 13-pin socket through a
Ford approved trailer tow module.
Note: Keep the sensors free from dirt, ice
or snow. Do not clean with sharp objects.
Note: The system may emit false alerts if
it detects a signal using the same frequency
as the sensors or if your vehicle is fully
loaded.
Note: The outer sensors may detect the
side walls of a garage. If the distance
between the outer sensors and the side wall
remains constant for three seconds, the
alert will turn off. As you continue the inner
sensors will detect objects directly behind
your vehicle.
REAR PARKING AID
The rear sensors are only active when the
transmission is in reverse (R). As your
vehicle moves closer to the obstacle, the
rate of the audible warning increases.
When the obstacle is less than 10 in
(25 cm) away, the warning sounds
continuously. If the system detects a
150
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Parking Aids
stationary or receding object farther than
10 in (25 cm) from the corners of the
bumper, the tone sounds for only three
seconds. Once the system detects an
object approaching, the warning sounds
again.
E130178
Coverage area of up to 6 ft (1.8 m) from
the rear bumper. There may be decreased
coverage area at the outer corners of the
bumper.
The system detects certain objects while
the transmission is in reverse (R) :
• Your vehicle is moving toward a
stationary object at a speed of 3 mph
(5 km/h) or less.
• Your vehicle is not moving, but a
moving object is approaching the rear
of your vehicle at a speed of 3 mph
(5 km/h) or less.
• Your vehicle is moving at a speed of
less than 3 mph (5 km/h) and a moving
object is approaching the rear of your
vehicle at a speed of less than 3 mph
(5 km/h).
FRONT PARKING AID (If Equipped)
The front sensors are active when the
transmission is any position other than
park (P).
E187330
Coverage area of up to 28 in (70 cm) from
the front bumper. There is decreased
coverage area at the outer corners.
When your vehicle approaches an object,
a warning tone sounds. When your vehicle
moves closer to an object, the warning
tone repeat rate increases. The warning
tone sounds continuously when an object
is 12 in (30 cm) or less from the front
bumper.
Obstacle Distance Indicator (If
Equipped)
The system provides obstacle distance
indication through the information display.
The indicator displays:
• As the distance to the obstacle
decreases the indicator blocks
illuminate and move towards the
vehicle icon.
• If there is no obstacle detected, the
distance indicator blocks are greyed
out.
151
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Parking Aids
If the transmission is in reverse (R), the
front sensing system provides audio
warnings when your vehicle is moving and
the detected obstacle is moving towards
your vehicle. Once the vehicle is stationary,
the audio warning will be stopped after 2
seconds.
If the transmission is in drive (D) or any
other forward gear (for example, low (L),
sport (S) or any forward gear in a manual
transmission), the front sensing system
provides audio and visual warnings when
your vehicle is moving below a speed of
7 mph (12 km/h) and an obstacle is located
inside the detection area. Once the vehicle
is stationary, the audio warning will be
stopped after 2 seconds and the visual
indication stops after 4 seconds. If the
obstacles detected are within 12 in
(30 cm), the visual indication remains on.
If the transmission is in neutral (N), the
system provides visual indication only
when your vehicle is moving at 7 mph
(12 km/h) or below and an obstacle is
located inside the detection area. Once
your vehicle is stationary, the visual
indication will stop after 4 seconds.
ACTIVE PARK ASSIST (If Equipped)
WARNINGS
Designed to be a supplementary park
aid, this system may not work in all
conditions. This system cannot
replace the driver’s attention and
judgment. The driver is responsible for
avoiding hazards and maintaining a safe
distance and speed, even when the system
is in use.
Active Park Assist does not apply the
brakes under any circumstances.
Note: The driver is always responsible for
controlling the vehicle, supervising the
system and intervening if required.
Active Park Assist is an electronic parking
aid that uses ultrasonic sensors. The
system detects an available parallel
parking space and automatically steers
your vehicle into the space (hands-free)
while you control the accelerator, gearshift
and brakes. The system visually and
audibly instructs you to park your vehicle.
The system may not function correctly if
something passes between the front
bumper and the parking space (a
pedestrian or cyclist) or if the edge of the
neighboring parked vehicle is high off the
ground (for example, a bus, tow truck or
flatbed truck).
Note: The sensors may not detect objects
in heavy rain, snow or other conditions that
cause disruptive reflections.
Note: Keep the sensors, located on the
bumper or fascia, free from snow, ice and
large accumulations of dirt. Covered sensors
can affect the system's accuracy. Do not
clean the sensors with sharp objects.
Note: The sensors may not detect objects
with surfaces that absorb ultrasonic waves.
Do not use the system if:
• You have attached a foreign object
(bike rack or trailer) to the front or rear
of your vehicle or close to the sensors.
• You have attached an overhanging
object (surfboard) to the roof.
• A foreign object damages or obstructs
the sensors.
• The correct tire size is not in use on your
vehicle (for example, a mini-spare tire).

When the system finds a suitable space,
the touchscreen displays a message and
a tone sounds. Stop your vehicle and
follow the instructions on the touchscreen.
If your vehicle is moving very slowly, you
may need to pull forward a short distance
before the system is ready to park.
Note: You must observe that the selected
space remains clear of obstructions at all
times in the maneuver.
Note: Active park assist may not detect
vehicles with overhanging loads (a bus or a
truck), street furniture such as benches and
fire hydrants and other items. You must
make sure the selected space is suitable for
parking.
Note: You should drive your vehicle within
5 ft (1.5 m) and as parallel to the other
vehicles as possible while passing a parking
space.
Note: The system always offers the last
detected parking space (for example, if the
vehicle detects multiple spaces while you
are driving, it offers the last one).
Note:If driven above approximately 22 mph
(35 km/h), the touchscreen shows a
message to alert you to reduce your vehicle
speed.
Automatic Steering into Parking
Space
Note: If your vehicle speed exceeds 6 mph
(9 km/h), the system turns off and you need
to take full control of your vehicle.
When you shift the transmission into
reverse (R), with your hands off the wheel
(and nothing obstructing its movement),
your vehicle steers itself into the space.
Indicated by tones, instructions to move
your vehicle back and forth in the space
appear on the display screen.

When you think your vehicle is properly
parked, or you hear a solid tone from the
parking aid (accompanied by a
touchscreen display message and a
chime), bring your vehicle to a complete
stop.
When automatic steering is finished, the
touch screen displays a message and a
tone sounds, indicating that the active park
assist process is done. The driver is
responsible for checking the parking job
and making any necessary corrections
before putting the transmission in park (P).
Deactivating the Park Assist
Feature
Manually deactivate the system by:
• Pressing the active park assist button.
• Grabbing the steering wheel during
automatic steering.
• Driving above approximately 22 mph
(35 km/h) for 30 seconds during an
active park search.
• Driving above 6 mph (9 km/h) during
automatic steering.
• Turning off the traction control system.
Certain vehicle conditions can also
deactivate the system, such as:
• Traction control has activated on a
slippery or loose surface.
• There is an anti-lock brake system
activation or failure.
If a problem occurs with the system, a
warning message displays, followed by a
tone. Occasional system messages may
occur in normal operation. For recurring or
frequent system faults, contact an
authorized dealer to have your vehicle
serviced.
Troubleshooting the System
The system does not look for a space
The traction control system may be off.
The transmission is in reverse (R); your vehicle must be moving forward to detect a
parking space.
You recently disconnected or replaced the battery. After a battery disconnect, you must
drive your vehicle for a short period of time before Active Park Assist becomes functional.
154
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Parking Aids
The system does not offer a particular space
Something may be contacting the sensors.
There is not enough room in the parking space for the vehicle to safely park.
There is not enough space for the parking maneuver on the opposite side of the parking
space.
Your vehicle is farther than 4.9 ft (1.5 m) from the parking space.
Your vehicle is closer than 16 in (40 cm) from neighboring parked vehicles.
The transmission is in reverse (R); your vehicle must be moving forward to detect a
parking space.
Your vehicle is going faster than 22 mph (35 km/h).
The system does not position the vehicle where I want in the space
Your vehicle is rolling in the opposite direction of the transmission (rolling forward with
reverse (R) selected).
An irregular curb along the parking space prevents the system from aligning your vehicle
properly.
Vehicles or objects bordering the space may not be positioned correctly.
You pulled your vehicle too far past the parking space. The system performs best when
you drive the same distance past the parking space.
The tires may not be installed or maintained correctly (not inflated correctly, improper
size, or of different sizes).
A repair or alteration has changed detection capabilities.
A parked vehicle has a high attachment (salt sprayer, snowplow or moving truck bed).
The parking space length or position of parked objects changed after your vehicle passed.
The temperature around your vehicle changes quickly (driving from a heated garage
into the cold, or after leaving a car wash).
You didn't wait for the steering wheel to complete its rotation after a gear change. The
system performs best when the steering wheel is allowed to finish rotating before
accelerating.

REAR VIEW CAMERA
WARNINGS
The rear view camera system is a
reverse aid supplement device that
still requires the driver to use it in
conjunction with the interior and exterior
mirrors for maximum coverage.
Objects that are close to either
corner of the bumper or under the
bumper, might not be seen on the
screen due to the limited coverage of the
camera system.
Back up as slow as possible since
higher speeds might limit your
reaction time to stop your vehicle.
Use caution when using the rear
video camera and the luggage
compartment door is ajar. If the
luggage compartment door is ajar, the
camera will be out of position and the
video image may be incorrect. All
guidelines disappear when the luggage
compartment door is ajar.
Use caution when turning camera
features on or off. Make sure your
vehicle is not moving.
The rear view camera system provides a
video image of the area behind your
vehicle.
During operation, lines appear in the
display which represent your vehicle’s path
and proximity to objects behind your
vehicle.
E142435
The camera is located on the luggage
compartment door.
Using the Rear View Camera
System
The rear view camera system displays
what is behind your vehicle when you place
the transmission in reverse (R).
Note: The reverse sensing system is not
effective at speeds above 7 mph (12 km/h)
and may not detect certain angular or
moving objects.
The system uses three types of guides to
help you see what is behind your vehicle:
• Active guidelines: Show the intended
path of your vehicle when reversing.
• Fixed guidelines: Show the actual path
your vehicle is moving in while reversing
in a straight line. This can be helpful
when backing into a parking space or
aligning your vehicle with another
object behind you.
• Centerline: Helps align the center of
your vehicle with an object (for
example, a trailer).
Note: If the transmission is in reverse (R)
and the luggage compartment is ajar, no
rear view camera features display.
156
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Parking Aids
Note: When towing, the camera only sees
what is towed behind your vehicle. This
might not provide adequate coverage as it
usually provides in normal operation and
some objects might not be seen. In some
vehicles, the guidelines may disappear once
the trailer tow connector is engaged.
The camera may not operate correctly
under the following conditions:
• Nighttime or dark areas if one or both
reverse lamps are not operating.
• Mud, water or debris obstructs the
camera's view. Clean the lens with a
soft, lint-free cloth and non-abrasive
cleaner.
• The rear of your vehicle is hit or
damaged, causing the camera to
become misaligned.

Parking Aids
The fixed and active guidelines fade in and
out depending on the steering wheel
position. The active guidelines do not
display when the steering wheel position
is straight.
Always use caution while reversing.
Objects in the red zone are closest to your
vehicle and objects in the green zone are
farther away. Objects are getting closer to
your vehicle as they move from the green
zone to the yellow or red zones. Use the
side view mirrors and rear view mirror to
get better coverage on both sides and rear
of your vehicle.
Manual Zoom
WARNING
When manual zoom is on, the full
area behind your vehicle may not
show. Be aware of your surroundings
when using the manual zoom feature.

BLIND SPOT INFORMATION
SYSTEM
WARNING
To help avoid injuries, NEVER use the
Blind Spot Information System as a
replacement for using the interior
and exterior mirrors or looking over your
shoulder before changing lanes. The Blind
Spot Information System is not a
replacement for careful driving.
A
A
E124788
The Blind Spot Information System is
designed to aid you in detecting vehicles
that may have entered the blind spot zone
(A). The detection area is on both sides of
your vehicle, extending rearward from the
exterior mirrors to approximately 13 ft
(4 m) beyond the bumper. The system is
designed to alert you if certain vehicles
enter the blind spot zone while driving.
Note: The Blind Spot Information System
does not prevent contact with other vehicles
or objects; nor detect parked vehicles,
people, animals or infrastructure (fences,
guardrails, trees). It’s only designed to alert
you to vehicles in the blind spot zones.
Note: When a vehicle passes quickly
through the blind spot zone, typically fewer
than two seconds, the system does not
trigger.
Using the System
The Blind Spot Information System turns
on when you start the engine and you drive
your vehicle forward above 5 mph
(8 km/h).
For automatic transmissions, the Blind
Spot Information System remains on while
the transmission is in drive (D). If shifted
into reverse (R) or park (P) the Blind Spot
Information System turns off. Once shifted
back into drive (D), the Blind Spot
Information System turns back on when
you drive your vehicle above 5 mph
(8 km/h).
For manual transmissions, the Blind Spot
Information System is on for all gears
except the reverse (R).
Note: The Blind Spot Information System
does not function in reverse (R) or park (P).
System Lights and Messages

Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Driving Aids
The Blind Spot Information System
illuminates an amber alert indicator in the
outside mirror on the side of your vehicle
the approaching vehicle is coming from.
When the Blind Spot Information System
is alerting on a vehicle and the
corresponding turn signal is ON, the Blind
Spot Information System alert indicator
flashes as an increased warning level.
The alert indicator dims when the system
detects nighttime darkness.
Note: The alert indicator flashes in case of

at the same time.
System Sensor Blockage
WARNING
To help avoid injuries, NEVER use the
Blind Spot Information System as a
replacement for using the interior
and exterior mirrors or looking over your
shoulder before changing lanes. The Blind
Spot Information System is not a
replacement for careful driving. E205199
The system uses radar sensors that are
located behind the bumper fascia on each
side of your vehicle. Any dirt, mud and
snow in front of the sensors and/or driving
in heavy rain can cause system
degradation. Also, other types of
obstructions in front of the sensor can
cause system degradation. This is referred
to as a ‘blocked’ condition.
Note: Do not apply bumper stickers and/or
repair compound to these areas, this can
cause degraded system performance.
167
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Driving Aids
If the system detects a degraded
performance condition, a message warning
of a blocked sensor will appear in the
information display. Also the BLIS alert
indicators will remain ON and BLIS will no
longer provide any vehicle warnings. You
can clear the information display warning
but the alert indicators will remain
illuminated.
A "blocked" condition can be cleared in
two ways:
• After the blockage in front of the
sensors is removed or the
rainfall/snowfall rate decreases or
stops, drive for a few minutes in traffic
to allow the sensors to detect passing
vehicles.
• By cycling the ignition from ON to OFF
and then back ON.
Note: If your vehicle has a tow bar with a
factory equipped trailer tow module and it
is towing a trailer, the sensors will
automatically turn the Blind Spot
Information System off. If your vehicle has
a tow bar but no factory equipped trailer
tow module, it is recommended to turn the
Blind Spot Information System off
manually. Operating the Blind Spot
Information System with a trailer attached
will cause poor system performance.
System Errors
If the system senses a problem with the
left or right sensor, the telltale will
illuminate and a message will appear in
the information display. See Information
Messages (page 95).
Switching the System Off and On
You can temporarily switch the Blind Spot
Information System off in the information
display. See General Information (page
91). When the Blind Spot Information
System switches off, you will not receive
alerts and the information display shows
a system off message. The telltale in the
cluster also illuminates. When you switch
the Blind Spot Information System on or
off, the alert indicators flash twice.
Note: The Blind Spot Information System
remembers the last selected on or off
setting.
You can also have the Blind Spot
Information System switched off
permanently at an authorized dealer. Once
switched off permanently, the system can
only be switched back on at an authorized
dealer.
CROSS TRAFFIC ALERT
WARNING
To help avoid personal injury, NEVER
use the Cross Traffic Alert system as
a replacement for using the interior
and exterior mirrors and looking over your
shoulder before backing out of a parking
space. Cross Traffic Alert is not a
replacement for careful driving.
Cross Traffic Alert is designed to warn you
of vehicles approaching from the sides
when the transmission is in reverse (R).
Using the System
Cross Traffic Alert turns on when you start
the engine and you shift into reverse (R).
Once shifted out of reverse (R), Cross
Traffic Alert turns off.
Note: Cross Traffic Alert only functions
while your transmission is in reverse (R).
168
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Driving Aids
Cross Traffic Alert is designed to detect
vehicles that approach with a speed up to
37 mph (60 km/h). Coverage decreases
when the sensors are partially, mostly or
fully obstructed. Reversing slowly helps
increase the coverage area and
effectiveness.
E142440
In this first example, the left sensor is only
partially obstructed; zone coverage to the
right is nearly maximized.
E142441
169
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Driving Aids
Zone coverage also decreases when
parking at shallow angles. Here, the left
sensor is mostly obstructed; zone coverage
on that side is severely limited.
System Lights, Messages and
Audible Alerts
E142442
The Cross Traffic Alert illuminates an
amber alert indicator in the outside mirror
on the side of your vehicle the approaching
vehicle is coming from. Cross Traffic Alert
also sounds an audible alert and a
message appears in the information
display indicating a vehicle is coming from
the right or left. Cross Traffic Alert works
with the reverse sensing system that
sounds its own series of tones. See Rear
Parking Aid (page 150).
E205199
The system uses radar sensors that are
located behind the bumper fascia on each
side of your vehicle. Do not allow mud,
snow or bumper stickers to obstruct these
areas, this can cause degraded system
performance. See Blind Spot
Information System (page 166). If the
Blind Spot Information System is blocked,
Cross Traffic Alert is also blocked. A
corresponding message appears in the
information display as soon as you shift
the transmission into reverse (R).
System Limitations
Cross Traffic Alert has its limitations;
situations such as severe weather
conditions or debris build-up on the sensor
area may limit vehicle detection.
170
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Driving Aids
The following are other situations that may
limit the Cross Traffic Alert performance:
• Adjacently parked vehicles or objects
obstructing the sensors.
• Approaching vehicles passing at
speeds greater than 37 mph
(60 km/h).
• Driving in reverse faster than 7 mph
(12 km/h).
• Backing out of an angled parking spot.
False Alerts
Note: If your vehicle has a tow bar with a
factory equipped trailer tow module and it
is towing a trailer, the sensors will
automatically turn the Cross Traffic Alert
off. If your vehicle has a tow bar but no
factory equipped trailer tow module, it is
recommended to turn the Cross Traffic Alert
off manually. Operating Cross Traffic Alert
with a trailer attached will cause poor Cross
Traffic Alert performance.
There may be certain instances when there
is a false alert by the Cross Traffic Alert
system that illuminates the alert indicator
with no vehicle in the coverage zone. Some
amount of false alerts are normal; they are
temporary and self-correct.
System Errors
If Cross Traffic Alert senses a problem with
the left or right sensor a message will
appear in the information display. See
Information Messages (page 95).
Switching the System Off and On
You can temporarily switch Cross Traffic
Alert off in the information display. See
Information Messages (page 95). When
you switch Cross Traffic Alert off, you will
not receive alerts and the information
display will display a system off message.
Note: The Cross Traffic Alert switches on
whenever the ignition is switched on and
ready to provide appropriate alerts when
the transmission is in reverse (R). Cross
Traffic Alert will not remember the last
selected on or off setting.
You can also have Cross Traffic Alert
switched off permanently at an authorized
dealer. Once switched off permanently,
the system can only be switched back on
at an authorized dealer.
ECO MODE
This system assists you in driving more
efficiently by constantly monitoring
characteristics of gear changing,
anticipation of traffic conditions and
speeds while driving.
The value of these characteristics is
represented by petals shown in the display,
with five petals being the most efficient.
The more efficiently you drive, the better
the rating, and the better your vehicle's
overall fuel economy.
Note: These efficiency values do not result
in a defined fuel consumption figure. It might
vary as it is not only related to these driving
habits, but also influenced by many other
factors such as short trips and cold starts.
Note: Frequent short trips, where the engine
does not fully warm up, will also increase
fuel consumption
The system is accessed using the
information display control. See General

STEERING
Electric Power Steering
WARNINGS
The electric power steering system
has diagnostic checks that
continuously monitor the system. If
a fault is detected, a message displays in
the information display. Stop your vehicle
as soon as it is safe to do so. Switch the
ignition off. After at least 10 seconds,
switch the ignition on and watch the
information display for a steering system
warning message. If a steering system
warning message returns, have the system
checked by an authorized dealer.
If the system detects an error, you
may not feel a difference in the
steering, however a serious condition
may exist. Obtain immediate service from
an authorized dealer, failure to do so may
result in loss of steering control.
Your vehicle has an electric power steering
system. There is no fluid reservoir. No
maintenance is required.
If your vehicle loses electrical power while
you are driving, electric power steering
assistance is lost. The steering system still
operates and you can steer your vehicle
manually. Manually steering your vehicle
requires more effort.
Extreme continuous steering may increase
the effort required for you to steer your
vehicle. This increased effort prevents
overheating and permanent damage to
the steering system. You do not lose the
ability to steer your vehicle manually.
Typical steering and driving maneuvers
allow the system to cool and return to
normal operation.

Steering Tips
If the steering wanders or pulls, check for:
• Correct tire pressures.
• Uneven tire wear.
• Loose or worn suspension
components.
• Loose or worn steering components.
• Improper vehicle alignment.
Note: A high crown in the road or high
crosswinds may also make the steering
seem to wander or pull.
Adaptive Learning
The electronic power steering system
adaptive learning helps correct road
irregularities and improves overall handling
and steering feel. It communicates with
the brake system to help operate

LOAD LIMIT
Vehicle Loading - with and
without a Trailer
This section will guide you in the
proper loading of your vehicle,
trailer or both, to keep your loaded
vehicle weight within its design
rating capability, with or without
a trailer. Properly loading your
vehicle will provide maximum
return of vehicle design
performance. Before loading your
vehicle, familiarize yourself with
174

the following terms for
determining your vehicle’s weight
ratings, with or without a trailer,
from the vehicle’s Tire Label or
Safety Compliance Certification
Label:
Base Curb Weight - is the weight
of the vehicle including full fluids
and all standard equipment. It
does not include passengers,
cargo, or optional equipment.
Vehicle Curb Weight - is the
weight of your new vehicle when
you picked it up from your
authorized dealer plus any
aftermarket equipment.
E143816
PAYLOAD
Payload - is the combined weight
of cargo and passengers that the
vehicle is carrying. The maximum
payload for your vehicle can be
found on the Tire Label on the
B-Pillar or the edge of the driver
door (vehicles exported outside
the US and Canada may not have
a Tire Label). Look for “THE
COMBINED WEIGHT OF
OCCUPANTS AND CARGO
SHOULD NEVER EXCEED XXX
kg OR XXX lb.” for maximum
payload. The payload listed on the
Tire Label is the maximum
payload for the vehicle as built by
the assembly plant. If you install
any aftermarket or
authorized-dealer installed
equipment on the vehicle, you
must subtract the weight of the
equipment from the payload listed
on the Tire Label in order to
determine the new payload.

WARNING
The appropriate loading
capacity of your vehicle can
be limited either by volume
capacity (how much space is
available) or by payload capacity
(how much weight the vehicle
should carry). Once you have
reached the maximum payload of
your vehicle, do not add more
cargo, even if there is space
available. Overloading or
improperly loading your vehicle
can contribute to loss of vehicle
control and vehicle rollover.

all cargo and passengers, that the
vehicle can handle without risking
damage. (Important: The towing
vehicle’s braking system is rated
for operation at Gross Vehicle
Weight Rating, not at Gross

Separate functional brakes should
be used for safe control of towed
vehicles and for trailers where the
Gross Combined Weight of the
towing vehicle plus the trailer
exceed the Gross Vehicle Weight
Rating of the towing vehicle. The
Gross Combined Weight must
never exceed the Gross
Combined Weight Rating.
Maximum Loaded Trailer
Weight - is the highest possible
weight of a fully loaded trailer the
vehicle can tow. It assumes a
vehicle with mandatory options,
driver and front passenger weight
(150 pounds [68 kilograms]
each), no cargo weight (internal
or external) and a tongue load of
10–15% (conventional trailer) or
king pin weight of 15–25% (fifth
wheel trailer). Consult an
authorized dealer (or the RV and
Trailer Towing Guide available at
an authorized dealer) for more
detailed information.
Tongue Load or Fifth Wheel
King Pin Weight - refers to the
amount of the weight that a trailer
pushes down on a trailer hitch.
Examples: For a 5000 pound
(2268 kilogram) conventional
trailer, multiply 5000 by 0.10 and
0.15 to obtain a proper tongue
load range of 500 to 750 pounds
(227 to 340 kilograms). For an
11500 pound (5216 kilogram) fifth
wheel trailer, multiply by 0.15 and
0.25 to obtain a proper king pin
load range of 1725 to 2875 pounds
(782 to 1304 kilograms).
WARNINGS
Do not exceed the GVWR or
the GAWR specified on the
Safety Compliance Certification
Label.
Do not use replacement tires
with lower load carrying
capacities than the original tires
because they may lower the
vehicle’s GVWR and GAWR
limitations. Replacement tires
with a higher limit than the original
tires do not increase the GVWR
and GAWR limitations.
Exceeding any vehicle weight
rating limitation could result
in serious damage to the vehicle
and/or personal injury.
Steps for determining the
correct load limit:
179
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Load Carrying
1. Locate the statement "The
combined weight of occupants
and cargo should never exceed
XXX kg or XXX lb." on your
vehicle’s placard.
2. Determine the combined
weight of the driver and
passengers that will be riding
in your vehicle.
3. Subtract the combined weight
of the driver and passengers
from XXX kg or XXX lb.
4. The resulting figure equals the
available amount of cargo and
luggage load capacity. For
example, if the “XXX” amount
equals 1,400 lb. and there will
be five 150 lb. passengers in
your vehicle, the amount of
available cargo and luggage
load capacity is 650 lb.
(1400-750 (5 x 150) = 650 lb.)
5. Determine the combined
weight of luggage and cargo
being loaded on the vehicle.
That weight may not safely
exceed the available cargo and
luggage load capacity
calculated in Step 4.
6. If your vehicle will be towing a
trailer, load from your trailer
will be transferred to your
vehicle. Consult this manual to
determine how this reduces the
available cargo and luggage
load capacity of your vehicle.
The following gives you a few
examples on how to calculate the
available amount of cargo and
luggage load capacity:
*Suppose your vehicle has a
1400-pound (635-kilogram) cargo
and luggage capacity. You decide
to go golfing. Is there enough load
capacity to carry you, four of your
friends and all the golf bags? You
and four friends average 220
pounds (99 kilograms) each and
the golf bags weigh approximately
30 pounds (13.5 kilograms) each.
The calculation would be: 1400 -
(5 x 220) - (5 x 30) = 1400 - 1100
- 150 = 150 pounds. Yes, you have
enough load capacity in your
vehicle to transport four friends
and your golf bags. In metric units,
the calculation would be: 635
kilograms - (5 x 99 kilograms) -
(5 x 13.5 kilograms) = 635 - 495 -
67.5 = 72.5 kilograms.
*Suppose your vehicle has a
1400-pound (635-kilogram) cargo
and luggage capacity. You and
one of your friends decide to pick
up cement from the local home
improvement store to finish that
patio you have been planning for
the past two years. Measuring the
inside of the vehicle with the rear
seat folded down, you have room
for twelve 100-pound
(45-kilogram) bags of cement. Do
you have enough load capacity to
transport the cement to your
home? If you and your friend each
weigh 220 pounds (99 kilograms),
the calculation would be: 1400 -
(2 x 220) - (12 x 100) = 1400 - 440
- 1200 = - 240 pounds. No, you do
not have enough cargo capacity
to carry that much weight. In
metric units, the calculation would
180
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Load Carrying
be: 635 kilograms - (2 x 99
kilograms) - (12 x 45 kilograms) =
635 - 198 - 540 = -103 kilograms.
You will need to reduce the load
weight by at least 240 pounds
(104 kilograms). If you remove
three 100-pound (45-kilogram)
cement bags, then the load
calculation would be: 1400 - (2 x
220) - (9 x 100) = 1400 - 440 -
900 = 60 pounds. Now you have
the load capacity to transport the
cement and your friend home. In
metric units, the calculation would
be: 635 kilograms - (2 x 99
kilograms) - (9 x 45 kilograms) =
635 - 198 - 405 = 32 kilograms.
The above calculations also
assume that the loads are
positioned in your vehicle in a
manner that does not overload
the Front or the Rear Gross Axle
Weight Rating specified for your
vehicle on the Safety Compliance
Certification Label. The label shall
be affixed to either the door hinge
pillar, door-latch post, or the door
edge that meets the door-latch
post, next to the driver's seating
position.

BREAKING-IN
You need to break in new tires for
approximately 300 miles (480
kilometers). During this time, your vehicle
may exhibit some unusual driving
characteristics.
Avoid driving too fast during the first 1000
miles (1600 kilometers). Vary your speed
frequently and change up through the
gears early. Do not labor the engine.
Do not tow during the first 1000 miles
(1600 kilometers).
ECONOMICAL DRIVING
Fuel economy is affected by several things
such as how you drive, the conditions you
drive under and how you maintain your
vehicle.
There are some things to keep in mind that
may improve your fuel economy:
• Accelerate and slow down in a smooth,
moderate fashion.
• Drive at steady speeds.
• Anticipate stops; slowing down may
eliminate the need to stop.
• Combine errands and minimize
stop-and-go driving(When running
errands, go to the furthest destination
first and then work your way back
home).
• Close the windows for high-speed
driving.
• Drive at reasonable speeds.
• Keep the tires properly inflated and use
only the recommended size.
• Use the recommended engine oil.
• Perform all regularly scheduled
maintenance.
There are also some things you may want
to avoid doing because they reduce your
fuel economy:
• Avoid sudden or hard accelerations.
• Avoid revving the engine before turning
off the car.
• Avoid long idle periods.
• Do not warm up your vehicle on cold
mornings.
• Reduce the use of air conditioning and
heat.
• Avoid using speed control in hilly
terrain.
• Do not rest your foot on the brake
pedal while driving.
• Avoid carrying unnecessary weight.
• Avoid adding particular accessories to
your vehicle (e.g. bug deflectors,
rollbars/light bars, running boards, ski
racks).
• Avoid driving with the wheels out of
alignment.
COLD WEATHER
PRECAUTIONS
The functional operation of some
components and systems can be affected
at temperatures below -13°F (-25°C).
DRIVING THROUGH WATER
WARNING
Do not drive through flowing or deep
water as you may lose control of your
vehicle.
Note: Driving through standing water can
cause vehicle damage.
Note: Engine damage can occur if water
enters the air filter.
186
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Driving Hints
Before driving through standing water,
check the depth. Never drive through water
that is higher than the bottom of the front
rocker area of your vehicle.
E176360
When driving through standing water, drive
very slowly and do not stop your vehicle.
Your brake performance and traction may
be limited. After driving through water and
as soon as it is safe to do so:
• Lightly press the brake pedal to dry the
brakes and to check that they work.
• Check that the horn works.
• Check that the exterior lights work.
• Turn the steering wheel to check that
the steering power assist works.
FLOOR MATS
WARNINGS
Always use floor mats that are
designed to fit the foot well of your
vehicle. Only use floor mats that
leave the pedal area unobstructed. Only
use floor mats that are firmly secured to
retention posts so that they cannot slip out
of position and interfere with the pedals
or impair safe operation of your vehicle in
other ways.
WARNINGS
Pedals that cannot move freely can
cause loss of vehicle control and
increase the risk of serious personal
injury.
Always make sure that the floor
mats are properly attached to the
retention posts in the carpet that are
supplied with your vehicle. Floor mats must
be properly secured to both retention posts
to make sure mats do not shift out of
position.
Never place floor mats or any other
covering in the vehicle foot well that
cannot be properly secured to
prevent them from moving and interfering
with the pedals or the ability to control the
vehicle.
Never place floor mats or any other
covering on top of already installed
floor mats. Floor mats should always
rest on top of vehicle carpeting surface and
not another floor mat or other covering.
Additional floor mats or any other covering
will reduce the pedal clearance and
potentially interfere with pedal operation.
Check attachment of floor mats on
a regular basis. Always properly
reinstall and secure floor mats that
have been removed for cleaning or
replacement.
Always make sure that objects
cannot fall into the driver foot well
while the vehicle is moving. Objects
that are loose can become trapped under
the pedals causing a loss of vehicle control.
Failure to properly follow floor mat
installation or attachment
instructions can potentially cause
interference with pedal operation causing
a loss of vehicle control.

HAZARD WARNING FLASHERS
Note: If used when the vehicle is not
running, the battery will lose charge. There
may be insufficient power to restart your
vehicle.
The hazard warning button is
located on the instrument panel.
Use it when your vehicle is
creating a safety hazard for other
motorists.
• Press the button to turn on the hazard
warning function, and the front and
rear direction indicators will flash.
• Press the button again to turn them
off.
FUEL SHUTOFF
WARNING
Failure to inspect and, if necessary,
repair fuel leaks after a collision may
increase the risk of fire and serious
injury. Ford Motor Company recommends
that the fuel system be inspected by an
authorized dealer after any collision.
In the event of a moderate to severe
collision, this vehicle includes a fuel pump
shutoff feature that stops the flow of fuel
to the engine. Not every impact will cause
a shutoff.
Should your vehicle shut off after a
collision, you may restart your vehicle. For
vehicles equipped with a key system:
1. Switch off the ignition.
2. Switch on the ignition.
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 to re-enable the
fuel pump.
For vehicles equipped with a push button
start system:
1. Press the START/STOP button to
switch off the ignition.
2. Press the brake pedal and press the
START/STOP button to switch on the
ignition.
3. Remove your foot from the brake pedal
and press the START/STOP button
to switch off the ignition.
4. You can either attempt to start the
engine by pressing the brake pedal and
the START/STOP button, or switch
on the ignition only by pressing the
START/STOP button without
pressing the brake pedal. Both ways
re-enable the fuel system.

Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Roadside Emergencies
Note: When you try to restart your vehicle
after a fuel shutoff, the vehicle makes sure
that various systems are safe to restart.
Once your vehicle determines that the
systems are safe, then the vehicle will allow
you to restart.
Note: In the event that your vehicle does
not restart after your third attempt, contact
an authorized dealer.
JUMP STARTING THE VEHICLE
WARNINGS
The gases around the battery can
explode if exposed to flames, sparks,
or lit cigarettes. An explosion could
result in personal injury or vehicle damage.
Batteries contain sulfuric acid which
can burn skin, eyes and clothing, if
contacted.
Use only an adequate-sized cable
with insulated clamps.
Preparing Your Vehicle
Note: Do not attempt to push-start your
automatic transmission vehicle. Automatic
transmissions do not have push-start
capability. Attempting to push-start a
vehicle with an automatic transmission may
cause transmission damage.
Note: Use only a 12-volt supply to start your
vehicle.
Note: Do not disconnect the battery of the
disabled vehicle as this could damage the
vehicle's electrical system.
Park the booster vehicle close to the hood
of the disabled vehicle, making sure the
two vehicles do not touch. Turn all
accessories off.
Connecting the Jumper Cables
WARNING
Do not attach the cables to fuel lines,
engine rocker covers, the intake
manifold or electrical components
as grounding points. Stay clear of moving
parts. To avoid reverse polarity
connections, make sure that you correctly
identify the positive (+) and negative (-)
terminals on both the disabled and booster
vehicles before connecting the cables.
Battery positions may vary.
Note: In the illustration, the bottom vehicle

GETTING THE SERVICES YOU
NEED
Warranty repairs to your vehicle must be
performed by an authorized dealer. While
any authorized dealer handling your vehicle
line will provide warranty service, we
recommend you return to your selling
authorized dealer who wants to ensure
your continued satisfaction.
Please note that certain warranty repairs
require special training and equipment, so
not all authorized dealers are authorized
to perform all warranty repairs. This means
that, depending on the warranty repair
needed, you may have to take your vehicle
to another authorized dealer.
A reasonable time must be allowed to
perform a repair after taking your vehicle
to the authorized dealer. Repairs will be
made using Ford or Motorcraft® parts, or
remanufactured or other parts that are
authorized by Ford.

In some states within the United States,
you must directly notify Ford in writing
before pursuing remedies under your
state's warranty laws, and Ford is also
allowed a final repair attempt.
Additionally, in some states within the
United States, a consumer has the option
of submitting a warranty dispute to the
BBB Auto Line before taking action under
the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, or to
the extent allowed by state law, before
pursuing replacement or repurchase
remedies provided by certain state laws.
This dispute handling procedure is not
required prior to enforcing state created
rights or other rights which are independent
of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act or
state replacement or repurchase laws.
IN CALIFORNIA (U.S. ONLY)
California Civil Code Section 1793.2(d)
requires that, if a manufacturer or its
representative is unable to repair a motor
vehicle to conform to the vehicle’s
applicable express warranty after a
reasonable number of attempts, the
manufacturer shall be required to either
replace the vehicle with one substantially
identical or repurchase the vehicle and
reimburse the buyer in an amount equal to
the actual price paid or payable by the
consumer (less a reasonable allowance
for consumer use). The consumer has the
right to choose whether to receive a refund
or replacement vehicle.
California Civil Code Section 1793.22(b)
presumes that the manufacturer has had
a reasonable number of attempts to
conform the vehicle to its applicable
express warranties if, within the first 18
months of ownership of a new vehicle or
the first 18000 miles (29 000 km),
whichever occurs first:
1. Two or more repair attempts are made
on the same non-conformity likely to
cause death or serious bodily injury OR
2. Four or more repair attempts are made
on the same nonconformity (a defect
or condition that substantially impairs
the use, value or safety of the vehicle)
OR
3. The vehicle is out of service for repair
of nonconformities for a total of more
than 30 calendar days (not necessarily
all at one time).
In the case of 1 or 2 above, the consumer
must also notify the manufacturer of the
need for the repair of the nonconformity

You are required to submit your warranty
dispute to BBB AUTO LINE before asserting
in court any rights or remedies conferred
by California Civil Code Section 1793.22(b).
You are also required to use BBB AUTO
LINE before exercising rights or seeking
remedies created by the Federal
Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, 15 U.S.C.
sec. 2301 et seq. If you choose to seek

THE BETTER BUSINESS
BUREAU (BBB) AUTO LINE
PROGRAM (U.S. ONLY)
Your satisfaction is important to Ford
Motor Company and to your dealer. If a
warranty concern has not been resolved
using the three-step procedure outlined
earlier in this chapter in the Getting the
Services you need section, you may be
eligible to participate in the BBB AUTO
LINE program.
The BBB AUTO LINE program consists of
two parts – mediation and arbitration.
During mediation, a representative of the
BBB will contact both you and Ford Motor
Company to explore options for settlement
of the claim. If an agreement is not reached
during mediation or you do not want to
participate in mediation, and if your claim
is eligible, you may participate in the
arbitration process. An arbitration hearing
will be scheduled so that you can present
your case in an informal setting before an
impartial person. The arbitrator will
consider the testimony provided and make
a decision after the hearing.
Disputes submitted to the BBB AUTO LINE
program are usually decided within forty
days after you file your claim with the BBB.
You are not bound by the decision, and
may reject the decision and proceed to
court where all findings of the BBB Auto
Line dispute, and decision, are admissible
in the court action. Should you choose to
accept the BBB AUTO LINE decision, Ford
is then bound by the decision, and must
comply with the decision within 30 days
of receipt of your acceptance letter.
BBB AUTO LINE Application: Using the
information provided below, please call or
write to request a program application.
You will be asked for your name and
address, general information about your
new vehicle, information about your
warranty concerns, and any steps you have
already taken to try to resolve them. A
Customer Claim Form will be mailed that
will need to be completed, signed and
returned to the BBB along with proof of
ownership. Upon receipt, the BBB will
review the claim for eligibility under the
Program Summary Guidelines.
You can get more information by
calling BBB AUTO LINE at
1-800-955-5100, or writing to:
BBB AUTO LINE
3033 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 600
Arlington, Virginia 22201
BBB AUTO LINE applications can also be
requested by calling the Ford Motor
Company Customer Relationship Center
at 1-800-392-3673.

right to change eligibility limitations, modify
procedures, or to discontinue this process

UTILIZING THE
MEDIATION/ARBITRATION
PROGRAM (CANADA ONLY)
For vehicles delivered to authorized
Canadian dealers. In those cases where
you continue to feel that the efforts by Ford
of Canada and the authorized dealer to
resolve a factory-related vehicle service
concern have been unsatisfactory, Ford of
Canada participates in an impartial third
party mediation/arbitration program
administered by the Canadian Motor
Vehicle Arbitration Plan (CAMVAP).
The CAMVAP program is a straight forward
and relatively speedy alternative to resolve
a disagreement when all other efforts to
produce a settlement have failed. This
procedure is without cost to you and is
designed to eliminate the need for lengthy
and expensive legal proceedings.
In the CAMVAP program, impartial
third-party arbitrators conduct hearings at
mutually convenient times and places in
an informal environment. These impartial
arbitrators review the positions of the
parties, make decisions and, when
appropriate, render awards to resolve
disputes. CAMVAP decisions are fast, fair,
and final as the arbitrator’s award is
binding on both you and Ford of Canada.
CAMVAP services are available in all
Canadian territories and provinces. For
more information, without charge or
obligation, call your CAMVAP Provincial
Administrator directly at 1-800-207-0685
or visit www.camvap.ca.
GETTING ASSISTANCE

Before exporting your vehicle to a foreign
country, contact the appropriate foreign

inform you of local vehicle registration
regulations and where to find unleaded
fuel.
If you cannot find unleaded fuel or can only
get fuel with an anti-knock index lower
than is recommended for your vehicle,
contact our Customer Relationship Center.
The use of leaded fuel in your vehicle
without proper conversion may damage
the effectiveness of your emission control
system and may cause engine knocking or
serious engine damage. Ford Motor
Company or Ford of Canada is not

of improper fuel. Using leaded fuel may
also result in difficulty importing your
vehicle back into the United States.

and could lead to engine damage that may
not be covered by your vehicle warranty.
Note: Make sure that the oil level is
between the minimum and the maximum
marks.
Note: The oil consumption of new engines
reaches its normal level after approximately
3,000 mi (5,000 km).
Adding Engine Oil
E142732
Only use oils certified for gasoline engines
by the American Petroleum Institute (API).
An oil with this trademark symbol
conforms to the current engine and
emission system protection standards and
fuel economy requirements of the
International Lubricants Specification
Advisory Council (ILSAC), comprised of
U.S. and Japanese automobile
manufacturers.
WARNINGS
Only add oil when the engine is cold.
If the engine is hot, wait 10 minutes
for the engine to cool down.
Do not remove the filler cap when
the engine is running.
216
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Maintenance
1. Remove the engine oil filler cap.
2. Add engine oil that meets Ford
specifications. See Capacities and
Specifications (page 265).
3. Wipe off any spilled oil.
4. Replace the engine oil filler cap. Turn
it clockwise until you feel a strong
resistance.
Note: Do not add oil further than the
maximum mark. Oil levels above the
maximum mark may cause engine damage.
Note: Soak up any spillage with an
absorbent cloth immediately.
ENGINE COOLANT CHECK
Checking the Engine Coolant
When the engine is cold, check the
concentration and level of the engine
coolant at the intervals listed in the
scheduled maintenance information. See
Scheduled Maintenance (page 336).
Note: Make sure that the level is between
the MIN and MAX marks on the coolant
reservoir.
Note: Coolant expands when it is hot. The
level may extend beyond the MAX mark.
Note: If the level is at the MIN mark, below
the MIN mark, or empty, add coolant
immediately. See Adding Engine Coolant
in this chapter.
Maintain coolant concentration within
48% to 50%, which equates to a freeze
point between -30°F (-34°C) and -34°F
(-37°C).
Note: For best results, coolant
concentration should be tested with a
refractometer, for example Robinair®
Coolant and Battery Refractometer 75240.
We do not recommend the use of
hydrometers or coolant test strips for
measuring coolant concentrations.
Note: Automotive fluids are not
interchangeable. Do not use engine coolant,
antifreeze or windshield washer fluid outside
of its specified function and vehicle location.
Adding Engine Coolant
WARNINGS
Do not add engine coolant when the
engine is hot. Steam and scalding
liquids released from a hot cooling
system can burn you badly. Also, spilling
coolant on hot engine parts can burn you.
Do not put engine coolant in the
windshield washer fluid reservoir. If
sprayed on the windshield, engine
coolant could make it difficult to see
through the windshield.
Do not add coolant further than the
MAX mark.
To reduce the risk of personal injury,
make sure the engine is cool before
unscrewing the coolant pressure
relief cap. The cooling system is under
pressure; steam and hot liquid can come
out forcefully when the cap is loosened
slightly.
Note: Do not use stop leak pellets, cooling
system sealants or additives as they can
cause damage to the engine cooling or
heating systems. The vehicle warranty does
not cover this damage.
Note: During normal vehicle operation, the
engine coolant may change color from
orange to pink or light red. As long as the
engine coolant is clear and uncontaminated,
this color change does not indicate that the
engine coolant has degraded, nor does it
require that qualified personnel drain the
engine coolant, flush the system or replace
the engine coolant.
217
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Maintenance
• Do not mix different colors or types of
coolant in your vehicle. Make sure the
correct coolant is used. Mixing of
engine coolants may harm the engine’s
cooling system. The use of incorrect
coolant may harm engine and cooling
system components and may void the
warranty. Use prediluted engine
coolant meeting the Ford specification.
See Capacities and Specifications
(page 265).
• In case of emergency, you can add a
large amount of water without engine
coolant in order to reach a vehicle
service location. In this instance, you
must have the cooling system drained,
chemically cleaned with Motorcraft
Premium Cooling System Flush, and
refilled with engine coolant as soon as
possible. Water alone (without engine
coolant) can cause engine damage, for
example corrosion, overheating or
freezing.
• Do not use alcohol, methanol, brine or
any engine coolants mixed with alcohol
or methanol antifreeze. Alcohol and
other liquids can cause engine damage,
for example overheating or freezing.
• Do not add extra inhibitors or additives
to the coolant. These can be harmful
and compromise the corrosion
protection of the engine coolant.
Unscrew the cap slowly. Any pressure will
escape as you unscrew the cap.
Add prediluted engine coolant meeting the
Ford specification. See Capacities and
Specifications (page 265).
Whenever you add coolant, check the
coolant level in the coolant reservoir the
next few times you drive the vehicle. If
necessary, add enough prediluted engine
coolant to bring the coolant level to the
correct level.
Recycled Engine Coolant
We do not recommend the use of recycled
engine coolant since a Ford-approved
recycling process is not yet available.
Used engine coolant should be disposed
of in an appropriate manner. Follow your
community’s regulations and standards
for recycling and disposing of automotive
fluids.
Severe Climates
If you drive in extremely cold climates:
• It may be necessary to have a Ford
authorized dealer increase the coolant
concentration above 50%.
• A coolant concentration of 60% will
provide improved freeze point
protection. Engine coolant
concentrations above 60% will
decrease the overheat protection
characteristics of the engine coolant
and may cause engine damage.
If you drive in extremely hot climates:
• It may be necessary to have a Ford
authorized dealer decrease the coolant
concentration to 40%.
• A coolant concentration of 40%
provides improved overheat protection.
Engine coolant concentrations below
40% will decrease the freeze and
corrosion protection characteristics of
the engine coolant and may cause
engine damage.
Vehicles driven year-round in non-extreme
climates should use prediluted engine
coolant for optimum cooling system and
engine protection.
AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION
FLUID CHECK
The automatic transmission does not have
a transmission fluid dipstick.
218
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Maintenance
Have an authorized dealer check and
change the transmission fluid at the
correct service interval. See Scheduled
Maintenance (page 336). Your
transmission does not consume fluid.
However, if the transmission slips, shifts
slowly or if you notice a sign of leaking
fluid, contact an authorized dealer.
Do not use supplemental transmission
fluid additives, treatments or cleaning
agents. The use of these materials may
affect transmission operation and result
in damage to internal transmission
components.
BRAKE FLUID CHECK
WARNINGS
Do not use any fluid other than the
recommended brake fluid as this will
reduce brake efficiency. Use of
incorrect fluid could result in the loss of
vehicle control, serious personal injury or
death.
Only use brake fluid from a sealed
container. Contamination with dirt,
water, petroleum products or other
materials may result in brake system
damage or failure. Failure to adhere to this
warning could result in the loss of vehicle
control, serious personal injury or death.
Do not allow the fluid to touch your
skin or eyes. If this happens, rinse the
affected areas immediately with
plenty of water and contact your physician.
A fluid level between the MAX and
MIN lines is within the normal
operating range and there is no need
to add fluid. A fluid level not in the normal
operating range could compromise the
performance of the system. Have your
vehicle checked immediately.
E170684
To avoid fluid contamination, the reservoir
cap must remain in place and fully tight,
unless you are adding fluid.
Only use fluid that meets Ford
specifications.
CLUTCH FLUID CHECK -
MANUAL TRANSMISSION
The clutch and brake systems share the
same fluid reservoir. See Brake Fluid
Check (page 219).
WASHER FLUID CHECK
When adding fluid, use a mixture of washer
fluid and water to help prevent freezing in
cold weather and improve the cleaning
capability. For information on fluid dilution,
refer to the product instructions.
Note: The reservoir supplies the front and
rear washer systems.

FUEL FILTER
Your vehicle is equipped with a lifetime
fuel filter that is integrated with the fuel
tank. Regular maintenance or replacement
is not needed.
CHANGING THE 12V BATTERY
WARNINGS
Batteries normally produce explosive
gases which can cause personal
injury. Therefore, do not allow
flames, sparks or lighted substances to
come near the battery. When working near
the battery, always shield your face and
protect your eyes. Always provide correct
ventilation.
When lifting a plastic-cased battery,
excessive pressure on the end walls
could cause acid to flow through the
vent caps, resulting in personal injury and
damage to the vehicle or battery. Lift the
battery with a battery carrier or with your
hands on opposite corners.
Keep batteries out of reach of
children. Batteries contain sulfuric
acid. Avoid contact with skin, eyes or
clothing. Shield your eyes when working
near the battery to protect against possible
splashing of acid solution. In case of acid
contact with skin or eyes, flush
immediately with water for a minimum of
15 minutes and get prompt medical
attention. If acid is swallowed, call a
physician immediately.
Battery posts, terminals and related
accessories contain lead and lead
compounds. Wash hands after
handling.
Your vehicle has a Motorcraft®
maintenance-free battery which normally
does not require additional water during
its life of service.
Note: If your vehicle's battery has a cover
or shield, make sure it is reinstalled after the
battery has been cleaned or replaced.
Note: See an authorized dealer for low
voltage battery access, testing, or
replacement.
When a low voltage battery replacement
is necessary, see an authorized dealer to
replace the low voltage battery with a Ford
recommended replacement low voltage
battery that matches the electrical
requirements of the vehicle.
To ensure proper operation of the battery
management system (BMS), do not allow
a technician to connect any electrical
device ground connection directly to the
low voltage battery negative post. A
connection at the low voltage battery
negative post can cause inaccurate
measurements of the battery condition
and potential incorrect system operation.
Note: If a person adds electrical or
electronic accessories or components to the
vehicle, the accessories or components may
adversely affect the low voltage battery
performance and durability and may also
affect the performance of other electrical
systems in the vehicle.
For longer, trouble-free operation, keep the
top of the battery clean and dry. Also,
make certain the battery cables are always
tightly fastened to the battery terminals.
If you see any corrosion on the battery or
terminals, remove the cables from the
terminals and clean with a wire brush. You
can neutralize the acid with a solution of
baking soda and water.
When a battery replacement is required,
the battery should only be replaced with
a Ford recommended replacement battery
that matches the electrical requirements
of the vehicle.
220
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Maintenance
Because your vehicle’s engine is
electronically-controlled by a computer,
some engine control settings are
maintained by power from the low voltage
battery. Some engine computer settings,
like the idle trim and fuel trim strategy,
optimize the driveability and performance
of the engine. Some other computer
settings, like the clock and radio station
presets, are also maintained in memory by
power from the low voltage battery. When
a technician disconnects and connects the
low voltage battery, these settings are
erased. Complete the following procedure
in order to restore the settings:
1. With the vehicle at a complete stop,
set the parking brake.
2. Shift into park (P).
3. Switch off all accessories.
4. Fully press the brake pedal and start
the vehicle.
5. Run the engine until it reaches normal
operating temperature. While the
engine is warming up, complete the
following: Reset the clock. See Audio
System (page 278). Reset the power
windows bounce-back feature. See
Windows and Mirrors (page 81).
Reset the radio station presets. See
Audio System (page 278).
6. Allow the engine to idle for at least one
minute. If the engine turns off, press
the accelerator pedal to start the
engine.
7. While the engine is running, press the
brake pedal and shift into neutral (N).
8. Allow the engine to run for at least one
minute by pressing on the accelerator
pedal.
9. Drive the vehicle at least 12 mi (20 km)
to completely relearn the idle and fuel
trim strategy.
Note: If you do not allow the engine to
relearn the idle and fuel trim strategy, the
idle quality of your vehicle may be adversely
affected until the engine computer
eventually relearns the idle trim and fuel
trim strategy.
Make sure that you dispose of old batteries
in an environmentally friendly way. Seek
advice from your local authority about
recycling old batteries.

CLEANING THE EXTERIOR
Wash your vehicle regularly with cool or
lukewarm water and a neutral pH
shampoo, we recommend Motorcraft
Detail Wash.
• Never use strong household detergents
or soap, for example dish washing or
laundry liquid. These products can
discolor and spot painted surfaces.
• Never wash your vehicle when it is hot
to the touch, or during strong or direct
sunlight.
• Dry your vehicle with a chamois or soft
terry cloth towel to eliminate water
spotting.
234
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Vehicle Care
• Immediately remove fuel spillages, bird
droppings, insect deposits and road tar.
These may cause damage to your
vehicle’s paintwork or trim over time.
We recommend Motorcraft Bug and
Tar Remover.
• Remove any exterior accessories, for
example antennas, before entering a
car wash.
Note: Suntan lotions and insect repellents
can damage painted surfaces. If these
substances come in contact with your
vehicle, wash the affected area as soon as
possible.
Exterior Chrome Parts
• Apply a high quality-cleaning product
to bumpers and other chrome parts.
Follow the manufacturer’s instructions.
We recommend Motorcraft Custom
Bright Metal Cleaner.
• Do not apply the cleaning product to
hot surfaces. Do not leave the cleaning
product on chrome surfaces longer
than the time recommended.
• Using other non-recommended
cleaners can result in severe and
permanent cosmetic damage.
Note: Never use abrasive materials, for
example steel wool or plastic pads as they
can scratch the chrome surface.
Note: Do not use chrome cleaner, metal
cleaner or polish on wheels or wheel covers.
Exterior Plastic Parts
For routine cleaning we recommend
Motorcraft Detail Wash. If tar or grease
spots are present, we recommend
Motorcraft Bug and Tar Remover.
Stripes or Graphics (If Equipped)
Hand washing your vehicle is preferred
however, pressure washing may be used
under the following conditions:
• Do not use water pressure higher than
2,000 psi (14,000 kPa).
• Do not use water hotter than 179°F
(82°C).
• Use a spray with a 40° wide spray
angle pattern.
• Keep the nozzle at a 12 in (305 mm)
distance and 90° angle to your
vehicle's surface.
Note: Holding the pressure washer nozzle
at an angle to the vehicle's surface may
damage graphics and cause the edges to
peel away from the vehicle's surface.
Underbody
Flush the complete underside of your
vehicle frequently. Keep body and door
drain holes free of debris or foreign
material.
WAXING
Regular waxing is necessary to protect your
car's paint from the elements. We
recommend that you wash and wax the
painted surface once or twice a year.
When washing and waxing, park your
vehicle in a shaded area out of direct
sunlight. Always wash your vehicle before
applying wax.
• Use a quality wax that does not contain
abrasives.
• Follow the manufacturer’s instructions
to apply and remove the wax.
• Apply a small amount of wax in a
back-and-forth motion, not in circles.
235
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Vehicle Care
• Do not allow wax to come in contact
with any non-body (low-gloss black)
colored trim. The wax will discolor or
stain the parts over time.
• Roof racks.
• Bumpers.
• Grained door handles.
• Side moldings.
• Mirror housings.
• Windshield cowl area.
• Do not apply wax to glass areas.
• After waxing, your car's paint should
feel smooth, and be free of streaks and
smudges.
CLEANING THE ENGINE
Engines are more efficient when they are
clean because grease and dirt buildup keep
the engine warmer than normal.
When washing:
• Take care when using a power washer
to clean the engine. The high-pressure
fluid could penetrate the sealed parts
and cause damage.
• Do not spray a hot engine with cold
water to avoid cracking the engine
block or other engine components.
• Spray Motorcraft Engine Shampoo and
Degreaser on all parts that require
cleaning and pressure rinse clean. In
Canada, use Motorcraft Engine
Shampoo.
• Never wash or rinse the engine while it
is hot or running; water in the running
engine may cause internal damage.
• Never wash or rinse any ignition coil,
spark plug wire or spark plug well, or
the area in and around these locations.
• Cover the battery, power distribution
box, and air filter assembly to prevent
water damage when cleaning the
engine.
CLEANING THE WINDOWS AND
WIPER BLADES
Car wash chemicals and environmental
fallout can result in windshield and wiper
blade contamination. Dirty windshield and
wipers will result in poor windshield wiper
operation. Keep the windshield and wiper
blades clean to maintain windshield wiper
performance.
To clean the windshield and wiper blades:
• Clean the windshield with a
non-abrasive glass cleaner. When
cleaning the interior of the windshield,
avoid getting any glass cleaner on the
instrument panel or door panels. Wipe
any glass cleaner off these surfaces
immediately.
• For windshields contaminated with
tree sap, chemicals, wax or bugs, clean
the entire windshield using steel wool
(no greater than 0000 grade) in a
circular motion and rinse with water.
• Clean the wiper blades with isopropyl
rubbing alcohol or windshield washer
concentrate.
Note: Do not use razor blades or other
sharp objects to clean or remove decals
from the inside of the heated rear window.
The vehicle warranty does not cover
damage caused to the heated rear window
grid lines.

CLEANING THE INTERIOR
WARNINGS
Do not use cleaning solvents, bleach
or dye on the vehicle’s safety belts,
as these actions may weaken the
belt webbing.
On vehicles equipped with
seat-mounted airbags, do not use
chemical solvents or strong
detergents. Such products could
contaminate the side airbag system and
affect performance of the side airbag in a
collision.
For fabric, carpets, cloth seats, safety belts
and seats equipped with side airbags:
• Remove dust and loose dirt with a
vacuum cleaner.
• Remove light stains and soil with
Motorcraft Professional Strength
Carpet & Upholstery Cleaner.
• If grease or tar is present on the
material, spot-clean the area first with
Motorcraft Spot and Stain Remover. In
Canada, use Motorcraft Multi-Purpose

• If a ring forms on the fabric after spot
cleaning, clean the entire area
immediately (but do not oversaturate)
or the ring will set.
• Do not use household cleaning
products or glass cleaners, which can
stain and discolor the fabric and affect
the flame retardant abilities of the seat
materials.
CLEANING THE INSTRUMENT
PANEL AND INSTRUMENT
CLUSTER LENS
WARNING
Do not use chemical solvents or
strong detergents when cleaning the
steering wheel or instrument panel
to avoid contamination of the airbag
system.
Note: Follow the same procedure as
cleaning leather seats for cleaning leather
instrument panels and leather interior trim
surfaces. See Cleaning Leather Seats
(page 238).
Clean the instrument panel and cluster
lens with a clean, damp and soft cloth,
then use a clean, dry and soft cloth to dry
these areas.
• Avoid cleaners or polishes that increase
the gloss of the upper portion of the
instrument panel. The dull finish in this
area helps protect you from
undesirable windshield reflection.
• Do not use any household cleaning
products or glass cleaners as these
may damage the finish of the
instrument panel, interior trim and
cluster lens.
• Wash or wipe your hands clean if you
have been in contact with certain
products such as insect repellent and
suntan lotion to avoid possible damage
to the interior painted surfaces.
• Do not allow air fresheners and hand
sanitizers to spill onto interior surfaces.
If a spill occurs, wipe off immediately.
Your warranty may not cover these
damages.
If a staining liquid like coffee or juice has
been spilled on the instrument panel or on
interior trim surfaces:
237

spots, road salt and industrial fallout.
Always read the instructions before using
cleaning products.
CLEANING THE ALLOY
WHEELS (If Equipped)
Note: Do not apply a cleaning chemical to
warm or hot wheel rims and covers.
Note: Some automatic car washes may
cause damage to the finish on your wheel
rims and covers.
238
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Vehicle Care
Note: Industrial-strength or heavy-duty
cleaners in combination with brush agitation
to remove brake dust and dirt, could wear
away the clear coat finish over a period time.
Note: Do not use hydrofluoric acid-based
or high caustic-based wheel cleaners, steel
wool, fuels or strong household detergents.
Note: If you intend parking your vehicle for
an extended period after cleaning the
wheels with a wheel cleaner, drive your
vehicle for a few minutes before doing so.
This will reduce the risk of increased
corrosion of the brake discs.
Alloy wheels and wheel covers are coated
with a clear coat paint finish. To maintain
their condition we recommend that you:
• Clean the wheels weekly using
Motorcraft Wheel and Tire Cleaner.
Apply using manufacturer's
instructions.

• Move vehicles at least 25 ft (7.5 m)
every 15 days to lubricate working parts
and prevent corrosion.
Removing Vehicle From Storage
When your vehicle is ready to come out of
storage, do the following:
• Wash your vehicle to remove any dirt
or grease film build-up on window
surfaces.
• Check windshield wipers for any
deterioration.
• Check under the hood for any foreign
material that may have collected
during storage such as mice or squirrel
nests.
• Check the exhaust for any foreign
material that may have collected
during storage.
• Check tire pressures and set tire
inflation per the Tire Label.
• Check brake pedal operation. Drive
your vehicle 15 ft (4.5 m) back and
forth to remove rust build-up.
• Check fluid levels (including coolant,
oil and gas) to make sure there are no
leaks, and fluids are at recommended
levels.
• If you remove the battery, clean the
battery cable ends and check for
damage.
Contact an authorized dealer if you have

TIRE CARE
Important Information for
235/40R18 Low-Profile Tires
and Wheels
If your vehicle is equipped with
235/40R18 tires, they are
low-profile tires. These tires and
wheels are designed to give your
vehicle a sport appearance. With
low-profile tires, you may notice
an increase in road noise and
faster tire wear, depending on
road conditions and driving styles.
Due to their design, low-profile
tires and wheels are more prone
to road damage from potholes,
rough or unpaved roads, car wash
rails and curb contact than
standard tires and wheels.
Note:Your vehicle’s warranty does
not cover these types of damage.
Tires should always be kept at the
correct inflation pressures and
extra caution should be taken when
operating on rough roads to avoid
impacts that could cause wheel
and tire damage.
Information About Uniform
Tire Quality Grading
E142542
Tire Quality Grades apply to new
pneumatic passenger car tires.
The tire Quality Grades can be
found where applicable on the tire
sidewall between tread shoulder
and maximum section width. For
example: Treadwear 200
Traction AA Temperature A.
These Tire Quality Grades are
determined by standards that the
United States Department of
Transportation has set.
Tire Quality Grades apply to new
pneumatic passenger car tires.
They do not apply to deep tread,
winter-type snow tires,
space-saver or temporary use
spare tires, light truck or LT type
tires, tires with nominal rim
diameters of 10 to 12 inches or
limited production tires as defined
in Title 49 Code of Federal
Regulations Part 575.104 ©)(2).
241
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Wheels and Tires
U.S. Department of
Transportation-Tire quality
grades: The U.S. Department of
Transportation requires Ford
Motor Company to give you the
following information about tire
grades exactly as the government
has written it.
Treadwear
The treadwear grade is a
comparative rating based on the
wear rate of the tire when tested
under controlled conditions on a
specified government test course.
For example, a tire graded 150
would wear 1½ times as well on
the government course as a tire
graded 100. The relative
performance of tires depends
upon the actual conditions of their
use, however, and may depart
significantly from the norm due to
variations in driving habits, service
practices, and differences in road
characteristics and climate.
Traction AA A B C
WARNING
The traction grade assigned
to this tire is based on
straight-ahead braking traction
tests, and does not include
acceleration, cornering,
hydroplaning or peak traction
characteristics.
The traction grades, from highest
to lowest are AA, A, B, and C. The
grades represent the tire’s ability
to stop on wet pavement as
measured under controlled
conditions on specified
government test surfaces of
asphalt and concrete. A tire
marked C may have poor traction
performance.
Temperature A B C
WARNING
The temperature grade for
this tire is established for a
tire that is properly inflated and
not overloaded. Excessive speed,
under-inflation, or excessive
loading, either separately or in
combination, can cause heat
buildup and possible tire failure.
The temperature grades are A
(the highest), B and C,
representing the tire’s resistance
to the generation of heat and its
ability to dissipate heat when
tested under controlled conditions
on a specified indoor laboratory
test wheel. Sustained high
temperature can cause the
material of the tire to degenerate
and reduce tire life, and excessive
temperature can lead to sudden
tire failure. The grade C
corresponds to a level of
performance which all passenger
car tires must meet under the
242
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Wheels and Tires
Federal Motor Vehicle Safety
Standard No. 139. Grades B and A
represent higher levels of
performance on the laboratory
test wheel than the minimum
required by law.
Glossary of Tire Terminology
Tire label: A label showing the
OE (Original Equipment) tire sizes,
recommended inflation pressure
and the maximum weight the
vehicle can carry.
Tire Identification Number
(TIN): A number on the sidewall
of each tire providing information
about the tire brand and
manufacturing plant, tire size and

inflation pressure beyond this
pressure will not increase the tire’s
load carrying capability.
Extra load: A class of P-metric or
Metric tires designed to carry a
heavier maximum load at 42 psi
(2.9 bar). Increasing the inflation
pressure beyond this pressure will
not increase the tire’s load
carrying capability.
kPa: Kilopascal, a metric unit of
air pressure.
PSI: Pounds per square inch, a
standard unit of air pressure.
Cold tire pressure: The tire
pressure when the vehicle has
been stationary and out of direct
sunlight for an hour or more and
prior to the vehicle being driven for
1 mi (1.6 km).
Recommended inflation
pressure: The cold inflation
pressure found on the Safety
Compliance Certification Label
(affixed to either the door hinge
pillar, door-latch post, or the door
edge that meets the door-latch
post, next to the driver's seating
position) or Tire Label located on
the B-Pillar or the edge of the
driver’s door.
B-pillar: The structural member
at the side of the vehicle behind
the front door.
Bead area of the tire: Area of the
tire next to the rim.
Sidewall of the tire: Area
between the bead area and the
tread.
Tread area of the tire: Area of
the perimeter of the tire that
contacts the road when mounted

Location of the Tire Label
You will find a Tire Label
containing tire inflation pressure
by tire size and other important
information located on the B-Pillar

Inflating Your Tires
Safe operation of your vehicle
requires that your tires are
properly inflated. Remember that
a tire can lose up to half of its air
pressure without appearing flat.
Every day before you drive, check
your tires. If one looks lower than
the others, use a tire gauge to
check pressure of all tires and
adjust if required.
At least once a month and before
long trips, inspect each tire and
check the tire pressure with a tire
gauge (including spare, if
equipped). Inflate all tires to the
inflation pressure recommended
by Ford Motor Company.
248
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Wheels and Tires
WARNING
Under-inflation is the most
common cause of tire failures
and may result in severe tire
cracking, tread separation or
blowout, with unexpected loss of
vehicle control and increased risk
of injury. Under-inflation increases
sidewall flexing and rolling
resistance, resulting in heat
buildup and internal damage to
the tire. It also may result in
unnecessary tire stress, irregular
wear, loss of vehicle control and
accidents. A tire can lose up to
half of its air pressure and not
appear to be flat!
You are strongly urged to buy a
reliable tire pressure gauge, as
automatic service station gauges
may be inaccurate. Ford
recommends the use of a digital
or dial-type tire pressure gauge
rather than a stick-type tire
pressure gauge.
Use the recommended cold
inflation pressure for optimum tire
performance and wear.
Under-inflation or over-inflation
may cause uneven treadwear
patterns.
Always inflate your tires to the
Ford recommended inflation
pressure even if it is less than the
maximum inflation pressure
information found on the tire. The
Ford recommended tire inflation
pressure is found on the Safety
Compliance Certification Label
(affixed to either the door hinge
pillar, door-latch post, or the door
edge that meets the door-latch
post, next to the driver's seating
position), or Tire Label which is
located on the B-Pillar or the edge
of the driver door. Failure to follow
the tire pressure
recommendations can cause
uneven treadwear patterns and
adversely affect the way your
vehicle handles.
Maximum Inflation Pressure is
the tire manufacturer's maximum
permissible pressure or the
pressure at which the maximum
load can be carried by the tire. This
pressure is normally higher than
the manufacturer’s recommended
cold inflation pressure, which can
be found on the Safety
Compliance Certification Label
(affixed to either the door hinge
pillar, door-latch post, or the door
edge that meets the door-latch
post, next to the driver's seating
position), or Tire Label which is
located on the B-Pillar or the edge
of the driver’s door. The cold
inflation pressure should never be
set lower than the recommended
pressure on the Safety
Compliance Certification Label or
Tire Label.
249
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Wheels and Tires
When weather temperature
changes occur, tire inflation
pressures also change. A 10°F
(6°C) temperature drop can
cause a corresponding drop of
1 psi (7 kPa) in inflation pressure.
Check your tire pressures
frequently and adjust them to the
proper pressure which can be
found on the Safety Compliance
Certification Label or Tire Label.
To check the pressure in your
tire(s):
1. Make sure the tires are cool,
meaning they are not hot from
driving even a mile.
Note: If you are checking tire
pressure when the tire is hot, (for
example, driven more than 1 mile
[1.6 kilometers], never bleed or
reduce air pressure. The tires are
hot from driving and it is normal for
pressures to increase above
recommended cold pressures. A
hot tire at or below recommended
cold inflation pressure could be
significantly under-inflated.
Note: If you have to drive a
distance to get air for your tire(s),
check and record the tire pressure
first and add the appropriate air
pressure when you get to the
pump. It is normal for tires to heat
up and the air pressure inside to go
up as you drive.
2. Remove the cap from the valve
on one tire, then firmly press the
tire gauge onto the valve and
measure the pressure.
3. Add enough air to reach the
recommended air pressure.
Note: If you overfill the tire, release
air by pressing on the metal stem
in the center of the valve. Then
recheck the pressure with your tire
gauge.
4. Replace the valve cap.
5. Repeat this procedure for each
tire, including the spare.
Note: Some spare tires operate at
a higher inflation pressure than the
other tires. For T-type mini-spare
tires, refer to the Dissimilar spare
wheel and tire assembly
information for a description. Store
and maintain at 60 psi (4.15 bar).
For full-size and dissimilar spare
tires, refer to the Dissimilar spare
wheel and tire assembly
information for a description. Store
and maintain at the higher of the
front and rear inflation pressure as
shown on the Tire Label.
6. Visually inspect the tires to
make sure there are no nails or
other objects embedded that
could poke a hole in the tire and
cause an air leak.
7. Check the sidewalls to make
sure there are no gouges, cuts or
bulges.
250
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Wheels and Tires
Inspecting Your Tires and
Wheel Valve Stems
Periodically inspect the tire treads
for uneven or excessive wear and
remove objects such as stones,
nails or glass that may be wedged
in the tread grooves. Check the tire
and valve stems for holes, cracks,
or cuts that may permit air
leakage and repair or replace the
tire and replace the valve stem.
Inspect the tire sidewalls for
cracking, cuts, bruises and other
signs of damage or excessive
wear. If internal damage to the tire
is suspected, have the tire
demounted and inspected in case
it needs to be repaired or replaced.
For your safety, tires that are
damaged or show signs of
excessive wear should not be used
because they are more likely to
blow out or fail.
Improper or inadequate vehicle
maintenance can cause tires to
wear abnormally. Inspect all your
tires, including the spare,
frequently, and replace them if
one or more of the following
conditions exist:
Tire Wear
E142546
When the tread is worn down to
1/16th of an inch (2 mm), tires
must be replaced to help prevent
your vehicle from skidding and
hydroplaning. Built-in treadwear
indicators, or wear bars, which
look like narrow strips of smooth
rubber across the tread will
appear on the tire when the tread
is worn down to 1/16th of an inch
(2 mm).
When the tire tread wears down
to the same height as these wear
bars, the tire is worn out and must
be replaced.
Damage
Periodically inspect the tire treads
and sidewalls for damage (such
as bulges in the tread or sidewalls,
cracks in the tread groove and
separation in the tread or
sidewall). If damage is observed
251
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Wheels and Tires
or suspected have the tire
inspected by a tire professional.
Tires can be damaged during
off-road use, so inspection after
off-road use is also
recommended.
Age
WARNING
Tires degrade over time
depending on many factors
such as weather, storage
conditions, and conditions of use
(such as load, speed, inflation
pressure, etc.) the tires experience
throughout their lives.
In general, tires should be
replaced after six years regardless
of tread wear. However, heat
caused by hot climates or
frequent high loading conditions
can accelerate the aging process
and may require tires to be
replaced more frequently.
You should replace your spare tire
when you replace the road tires or
after six years due to aging even if
it has not been used.
U.S. DOT Tire Identification
Number
Both United States and Canada
Federal regulations require tire
manufacturers to place
standardized information on the
sidewall of all tires. This
information identifies and
describes the fundamental
characteristics of the tire and also
provides a United States DOT Tire
Identification Number for safety
standard certification and in case
of a recall.
This begins with the letters DOT
and indicates that the tire meets
all federal standards. The next
two numbers or letters are the
plant code designating where it
was manufactured, the next two
are the tire size code and the last
four numbers represent the week
and year the tire was built. For
example, the numbers 317 mean
the 31st week of 1997. After 2000
the numbers go to four digits. For
example, 2501 means the 25th
week of 2001. The numbers in

designed to provide a safe ride
and handling capability.
WARNINGS
Only use replacement tires
and wheels that are the same
size, load index, speed rating and
type (such as P-metric versus
LT-metric or all-season versus
all-terrain) as those originally
provided by Ford. The
recommended tire and wheel size
252
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Wheels and Tires
WARNINGS
may be found on either the Safety
Compliance Certification Label
(affixed to either the door hinge
pillar, door-latch post, or the door
edge that meets the door-latch
post, next to the driver's seating
position), or the Tire Label which
is located on the B-Pillar or edge
of the driver’s door. If this
information is not found on these
labels, then you should contact
your authorized dealer as soon as
possible. Use of any tire or wheel
not recommended by Ford can
affect the safety and performance
of your vehicle, which could result
in an increased risk of loss of
vehicle control, vehicle rollover,
personal injury and death.
Additionally the use of
non-recommended tires and
wheels could cause steering,
suspension, axle, transfer case or
power transfer unit failure. If you
have questions regarding tire
replacement, contact your
authorized dealer as soon as
possible.
When mounting replacement
tires and wheels, you should
not exceed the maximum pressure
indicated on the sidewall of the
tire to set the beads without
additional precautions listed
below. If the beads do not seat at
the maximum pressure indicated,
re-lubricate and try again.
WARNINGS
When inflating the tire for
mounting pressures up to 20 psi
(1.38 bar) greater than the
maximum pressure on the tire
sidewall, the following
precautions must be taken to
protect the person mounting the
tire:
1. Make sure that you have the
correct tire and wheel size.
2. Lubricate the tire bead and
wheel bead seat area again.
3. Stand at a minimum of 12 ft
(3.66 m) away from the wheel
and tire assembly.
4. Use both eye and ear
protection.
For a mounting pressure more
than 20 psi (1.38 bar) greater than
the maximum pressure, a Ford
dealer or other tire service
professional should do the
mounting.
Always inflate steel carcass tires
with a remote air fill with the
person inflating standing at a
minimum of 12 ft (3.66 m) away
from the wheel and tire assembly.
Important: Remember to replace
the wheel valve stems when the
road tires are replaced on your
vehicle.
253
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Wheels and Tires
It is recommended that the two
front tires or two rear tires
generally be replaced as a pair.
The tire pressure sensors mounted
in the wheels (originally installed
on your vehicle) are not designed
to be used in aftermarket wheels.
The use of wheels or tires not
recommended by Ford Motor
Company may affect the
operation of your tire pressure
monitoring system.
If the tire pressure monitoring
system indicator is flashing, your
tire pressure monitoring system is
malfunctioning. Your replacement
tire might be incompatible with
your TPMS, or some component
of the TPMS may be damaged.
Safety Practices
WARNINGS
If your vehicle is stuck in
snow, mud, sand, etc., do not
rapidly spin the tires. Spinning the
tires can tear the tire and cause
an explosion. A tire can explode in
as little as three to five seconds.
Do not spin the wheels at
over 30 mph (56 km/h). The
tires may fail and injure a
passenger or bystander.
Driving habits have a great deal
to do with your tire mileage and
safety.
Observe posted speed limits.
Avoid fast starts, stops and turns.
Avoid potholes and objects on the
road.
Do not run over curbs or hit the tire
against a curb when parking.
Highway Hazards
No matter how carefully you drive
there is always the possibility that
you may eventually have a flat tire
on the highway. Drive slowly to the
closest safe area out of traffic.
This may further damage the flat
tire, but your safety is more
important.
If you feel a sudden vibration or
ride disturbance while driving, or
you suspect your tire or vehicle
has been damaged, immediately
reduce your speed. Drive with
caution until you can safely pull
off the road. Stop and inspect the
tires for damage. If a tire is
under-inflated or damaged,
deflate it, remove wheel and
replace it with your spare tire and
wheel. If you cannot detect a
cause, have the vehicle towed to
the nearest repair facility or tire
dealer to have the vehicle
inspected.

Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Wheels and Tires
Tire and Wheel Alignment
A bad jolt from hitting a curb or
pothole can cause the front end
of your vehicle to become
misaligned or cause damage to
your tires. If your vehicle seems to
pull to one side when you are
driving, the wheels may be out of
alignment. Have an authorized
dealer check the wheel alignment
periodically.
Wheel misalignment in the front
or the rear can cause uneven and
rapid treadwear of your tires and
should be corrected by an
authorized dealer. Front-wheel
drive vehicles and those with an
independent rear suspension (if
equipped) may require alignment
of all four wheels.
The tires should also be balanced
periodically. An unbalanced tire
and wheel assembly may result in
irregular tire wear.
Tire Rotation
WARNING
If the tire label shows
different tire pressures for the
front and rear tires and the vehicle
is equipped with a tire pressure
monitoring system, then the
settings for the system sensors
need to be updated. Always
perform the system reset
procedure after tire rotation. If the
system is not reset, it may not
provide a low tire pressure
warning when necessary. See Tire
Pressure Monitoring System
(page 257).
Note: If your tires show uneven
wear ask an authorized dealer to
check for and correct any wheel
misalignment, tire imbalance or
mechanical problem involved
before tire rotation.
Note: Your vehicle may be
equipped with a dissimilar spare
wheel and tire assembly. A
dissimilar spare wheel and tire
assembly is defined as a spare
wheel and tire assembly that is
different in brand, size or
appearance from the road tires and
wheels. If you have a dissimilar
spare wheel and tire assembly it is
intended for temporary use only
and should not be used in a tire
rotation.
Note: After having your tires
rotated, inflation pressure must be
checked and adjusted to the
vehicle requirements.
255
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Wheels and Tires
Rotating your tires at the
recommended interval (as
indicated in the Scheduled
Maintenance chapter) will help
your tires wear more evenly,
providing better tire performance
and longer tire life.
Front-wheel drive vehicles (front
tires on the left side of the
diagram).
E142547
Sometimes irregular tire wear can
be corrected by rotating the tires.
USING SNOW CHAINS
WARNING
Snow tires must be the same size,
load index, speed rating as those
originally provided by Ford. Use of
any tire or wheel not recommended by
Ford can affect the safety and
performance of your vehicle, which could
result in an increased risk of loss of vehicle
control, vehicle rollover, personal injury and
death. Additionally, the use of
non-recommended tires and wheels could
cause steering, suspension, axle, transfer
case or power transfer unit failure.
The tires on your vehicle have all-weather
treads to provide traction in rain and snow.
However, in some climates, you may need
to use snow tires or snow chains.
If you choose to install snow tires on your
vehicle, they must be the same size,
construction, and load range as the original
tires listed on the tire inflation pressure
label (located on the edge of the driver
door or the B-Pillar) and they must be
installed on all four wheels. Mixing tires of
different size or construction on your
vehicle can adversely affect your vehicle’s
handling and braking, and may lead to loss
of vehicle control.
If you use snow chains, we recommend
that steel wheels of the same size and
specifications are used. Snow chains may
damage aluminum wheels.
Follow these guidelines when using snow
chains:
• Avoid fully loading your vehicle.
• Only use small link snow chains of
approximately 10mm with 215/55R16
tires only.
• Only use small link snow chains of
approximately 15mm with 195/65R15
tires only.
• Only use snow chains on the tire sizes
listed above.
• Snow chains must be mounted in pairs
on the front axle.
• Install snow chains securely, make sure
they do not touch any wiring, brake
lines or fuel lines.
• Do not exceed 30 mph (48 km/h) or
the maximum speed recommended by
the chain manufacturer, whichever is
less.
• Remove the cables when they are no
longer needed.
• Do not use snow chains on dry roads.

TIRE PRESSURE MONITORING
SYSTEM
WARNING
The tire pressure monitoring system
is not a substitute for manually
checking tire pressure. The tire
pressure should be checked periodically
(at least monthly) using a tire gauge, see
Inflating your tires in this chapter. Failure
to properly maintain your tire pressure
could increase the risk of tire failure, loss
of control, vehicle rollover and personal
injury.
Each tire, including the spare (if
provided), should be checked
monthly when cold and inflated
to the inflation pressure recommended by
the vehicle manufacturer on the vehicle
placard or tire inflation pressure label. (If
your vehicle has tires of a different size
than the size indicated on the vehicle
placard or tire inflation pressure label, you
should determine the proper tire inflation
pressure for those tires.)
As an added safety feature, your vehicle
has been equipped with a Tire Pressure
Monitoring System (TPMS) that
illuminates a low tire pressure telltale
when one or more of your tires is
significantly under-inflated. Accordingly,
when the low tire pressure telltale
illuminates, you should stop and check
your tires as soon as possible, and inflate
them to the proper pressure. Driving on a
significantly under-inflated tire causes the
tire to overheat and can lead to tire failure.
Under-inflation also reduces fuel efficiency
and tire tread life, and may affect the
vehicle’s handling and stopping ability.
Please note that the TPMS is not a
substitute for proper tire maintenance, and
it is the driver’s responsibility to maintain
correct tire pressure, even if under-inflation
has not reached the level to trigger
illumination of the TPMS low tire pressure
telltale.
Your vehicle has also been equipped with
a TPMS malfunction indicator to indicate
when the system is not operating properly.
The TPMS malfunction indicator is
combined with the low tire pressure
telltale. When the system detects a
malfunction, the telltale will flash for
approximately one minute and then remain
continuously illuminated. This sequence
will continue upon subsequent vehicle
start-ups as long as the malfunction exists.
When the malfunction indicator is
illuminated, the system may not be able
to detect or signal low tire pressure as
intended. TPMS malfunctions may occur
for a variety of reasons, including the
installation of replacement or alternate
tires or wheels on the vehicle that prevent
the TPMS from functioning properly.
Always check the TPMS malfunction
telltale after replacing one or more tires or
wheels on your vehicle to ensure that the
replacement or alternate tires and wheels
allow the TPMS to continue to function
properly.
The tire pressure monitoring system
complies with part 15 of the FCC rules and
with RSS-210 of Industry Canada.
Operation is subject to the following two
conditions: (1) This device may not cause
harmful interference, and (2) This device
must accept any interference received,
including interference that may cause
undesired operation.

Changing Tires With a Tire
Pressure Monitoring System
E142549
Note: Each road tire is equipped with a tire
pressure sensor located inside the wheel
and tire assembly cavity. The pressure
sensor is attached to the valve stem. The
pressure sensor is covered by the tire and is
not visible unless the tire is removed. Take
care when changing the tire to avoid
damaging the sensor
You should always have your tires serviced
by an authorized dealer.
Check the tire pressure periodically (at
least monthly) using an accurate tire
gauge. See Inflating Your Tires in this
chapter.
Understanding Your Tire Pressure
Monitoring System
The tire pressure monitoring system
measures pressure in your four road tires
and sends the tire pressure readings to
your vehicle. The low tire pressure warning
light will turn on if the tire pressure is
significantly low. Once the light is
illuminated, your tires are under-inflated
and need to be inflated to the
manufacturer’s recommended tire
pressure. Even if the light turns on and a
short time later turns off, your tire pressure
still needs to be checked.
When Your Temporary Spare Tire is
Installed
When one of your road tires needs to be
replaced with the temporary spare, the
system will continue to identify an issue to
remind you that the damaged road wheel
and tire assembly needs to be repaired and
put back on your vehicle.
To restore the full function of the tire
pressure monitoring system, have the
damaged road wheel and tire assembly
repaired and remounted on your vehicle.
When You Believe Your System is Not
Operating Properly
The main function of the tire pressure
monitoring system is to warn you when
your tires need air. It can also warn you in
the event the system is no longer capable
of functioning as intended. See the
following chart for information concerning
your tire pressure monitoring system:

When Inflating Your Tires
When putting air into your tires (such as at
a gas station or in your garage), the tire
pressure monitoring system may not
respond immediately to the air added to
your tires.
It may take up to two minutes of driving
over 20 mph (32 km/h) for the light to turn
off after you have filled your tires to the
recommended inflation pressure

Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Wheels and Tires
How Temperature Affects Your Tire
Pressure
The tire pressure monitoring system
monitors tire pressure in each pneumatic
tire. While driving in a normal manner, a
typical passenger tire inflation pressure
may increase about 2 to 4 psi (14 to 28
kPa) from a cold start situation. If the
vehicle is stationary overnight with the
outside temperature significantly lower
than the daytime temperature, the tire
pressure may decrease about 3 psi (21
kPa) for a drop of 30°F (17°C) in ambient
temperature. This lower pressure value
may be detected by the tire pressure
monitoring system as being significantly
lower than the recommended inflation
pressure and activate the system warning
light for low tire pressure. If the low tire
pressure warning light is on, visually check
each tire to verify that no tire is flat. If one
or more tires are flat, repair as necessary.
Check the air pressure in the road tires. If
any tire is under-inflated, carefully drive
the vehicle to the nearest location where
air can be added to the tires. Inflate all the
tires to the recommended inflation
pressure.
CHANGING A ROAD WHEEL
WARNINGS
The use of tire sealant may damage
your tire pressure monitoring system
and should only be used in roadside
emergencies. If you must use a sealant, the
Ford Tire Mobility Kit sealant should be
used. The tire pressure monitoring system
sensor and valve stem on the wheel must
be replaced by an authorized dealer after
use of the sealant.
If the tire pressure monitor sensor
becomes damaged, it will no longer
function. See Tire Pressure
Monitoring System (page 257).
Note: The tire pressure monitoring system
indicator light will illuminate when the spare
tire is in use. To restore the full function of
the monitoring system, all road wheels
equipped with tire pressure monitoring
sensors must be mounted on this vehicle.
If you get a flat tire while driving, do not
apply the brake heavily. Instead, gradually
decrease your speed. Hold the steering
wheel firmly and slowly move to a safe
place on the side of the road.
Have a flat serviced by an authorized
dealer in order to prevent damage to the
system sensors See Tire Pressure
Monitoring System (page 257). Replace
the spare tire with a road tire as soon as
possible. During repairing or replacing of
the flat tire, have the authorized dealer
inspect the system sensor for damage.
Dissimilar Spare Wheel and Tire
Assembly Information
WARNING
Failure to follow these guidelines
could result in an increased risk of
loss of vehicle control, injury or death.
If you have a dissimilar spare wheel and
tire, then it is intended for temporary use
only. This means that if you need to use it,
you should replace it as soon as possible
with a road wheel and tire assembly that
is the same size and type as the road tires
and wheels that were originally provided
by Ford. If the dissimilar spare tire or wheel
is damaged, it should be replaced rather
than repaired.
A dissimilar spare wheel and tire assembly
is defined as a spare wheel and tire
assembly that is different in brand, size or
appearance from the road tires and wheels
and can be one of three types:
260
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Wheels and Tires
1. T-type mini-spare: This spare tire
begins with the letter T for tire size and
may have Temporary Use Only molded in
the sidewall.
2. Full-size dissimilar spare with label
on wheel: This spare tire has a label on
the wheel that states: THIS WHEEL AND
TIRE ASSEMBLY FOR TEMPORARY USE
ONLY
When driving with one of the dissimilar
spare tires listed above, do not:
• Exceed 50 mph (80 km/h).
• Load the vehicle beyond maximum
vehicle load rating listed on the Safety
Compliance Label.
• Tow a trailer.
• Use snow chains on the end of the
vehicle with the dissimilar spare tire.
• Use more than one dissimilar spare tire
at a time.
• Use commercial car washing
equipment.
• Try to repair the dissimilar spare tire.
Use of one of the dissimilar spare tires
listed above at any one wheel location can

• Handling, stability and braking
performance.
• Comfort and noise.
• Ground clearance and parking at curbs.
• Winter weather driving capability.
• Wet weather driving capability.
• All-wheel driving capability.
3. Full-size dissimilar spare without
label on wheel
When driving with the full-size dissimilar
spare wheel and tire assembly, do not:
• Exceed 70 mph (113 km/h).
• Use more than one dissimilar spare
wheel and tire assembly at a time.
• Use commercial car washing
equipment.
• Use snow chains on the end of the
vehicle with the dissimilar spare wheel
and tire assembly.
The usage of a full-size dissimilar spare
wheel and tire assembly can lead to
impairment of the following:
• Handling, stability and braking
performance.
• Comfort and noise.
• Ground clearance and parking at curbs.
• Winter weather driving capability.
• Wet weather driving capability.
• All-wheel driving capability.
When driving with the full-size dissimilar
spare wheel and tire assembly, additional
caution should be given to:

cargo rack.
Drive cautiously when using a full-size
dissimilar spare wheel and tire assembly
and seek service as soon as possible.
Tire Change Procedure
WARNINGS
When one of the front wheels is off
the ground, the transmission alone
will not prevent the vehicle from
moving or slipping off the jack, even if the
transmission is in park (P) or neutral (N).
To help prevent the vehicle from
moving when you change a tire, be
sure to place the transmission in park
(P), set the parking brake and block (in
both directions) the wheel that is
diagonally opposite (other side and end of
the vehicle) to the tire being changed.
261
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Wheels and Tires
WARNINGS
Never get underneath a vehicle that
is supported only by a jack. If the
vehicle slips off the jack, you or
someone else could be seriously injured.
Do not attempt to change a tire on
the side of the vehicle close to
moving traffic. Pull far enough off the
road to avoid the danger of being hit when
operating the jack or changing the wheel.
Always use the jack provided as
original equipment with your vehicle.
If using a jack other than the one
provided as original equipment with your
vehicle, make sure the jack capacity is
adequate for the vehicle weight, including
any vehicle cargo or modifications.
Note: Passengers should not remain in the
vehicle when the vehicle is being jacked.
1. Park on a level surface, set the parking
brake and activate the hazard flashers.
2. Place the transmission in park (P)
(automatic transmission) or neutral
(N) (manual transmission) and turn
the engine off.

DRIVING AT HIGH SPEED
Tire pressure - Speeds greater than 100
mph (160 km/h)
WARNING
To reduce the risk of potential tire
failure that could lead to serious
injury or death, increase the front and
rear tire placard pressures by the amount
shown on the warning label, located on
either the driver side B-pillar or door, when
driving over 100 mph (160 km/h). Only
travel at speeds over 100 mph (160 km/h)
where it is legal and conditions allow. The
tire placard pressure can be found on the
tire placard located on either the driver side
B-pillar or door of your vehicle.
E176077
Warning: Failure to follow these
instructions can result in a loss
of vehicle stability due to tire
failure that could lead to serious injury or
death. If you are not sure about the proper
tire inflation pressures, contact an
authorized dealer or service center.
263
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Wheels and Tires
E184089
Your tires may require additional inflation
pressure for operation at speeds greater
than 100 mph (160 km/h). If this label is
present on your vehicle, you must adjust
the tire pressure accordingly.
LUG NUTS
WARNING
When a wheel is installed, always
remove any corrosion, dirt or foreign
materials present on the mounting
surfaces of the wheel or the surface of the
wheel hub, brake drum or brake disc that
contacts the wheel. Make sure that any
fasteners that attach the rotor to the hub
are secured so they do not interfere with
the mounting surfaces of the wheel.
Installing wheels without correct
metal-to-metal contact at the wheel
mounting surfaces can cause the wheel
nuts to loosen and the wheel to come off
while the vehicle is in motion, resulting in
loss of control.
Retighten the lug nuts to the specified
torque within 100 mi (160 km) after any
wheel disturbance (such as tire rotation,
changing a flat tire, wheel removal).

CD and CD Player Information
Note: CD units play commercially pressed
4.75-inch (12 centimeter) audio compact
discs only. Due to technical incompatibility,
certain recordable and re-recordable
compact discs may not function correctly
when used in Ford CD players.
Note: Do not insert CDs with homemade
paper (adhesive) labels into the CD player
as the label may peel and cause the CD to
become jammed. You should use a
permanent felt tip marker rather than
adhesive labels on your homemade CDs.
Ballpoint pens may damage CDs. Please
contact an authorized dealer for further
information.
Note: Do not use any irregularly shaped
discs or discs with a scratch protection film
attached.
Always handle discs by their edges only.
Clean the disc with an approved CD
cleaner only. Wipe it from the center of the
disc toward the edge. Do not clean in a
circular motion.
Do not expose discs to direct sunlight or
heat sources for extended periods.
MP3 and WMA Track and Folder
Structure
Audio systems capable of recognizing and
playing MP3 and WMA individual tracks
and folder structures work as follows:
• There are two different modes for MP3
and WMA disc playback: MP3 and
WMA track mode (system default) and
MP3 and WMA folder mode.
• MP3 and WMA track mode ignores any
folder structure on the MP3 and WMA
disc. The player numbers each MP3
and WMA track on the disc (noted by
the MP3 or WMA file extension) from
T001 to a maximum of T255. The
maximum number of playable MP3 and
WMA files may be less depending on
the structure of the CD and exact
model of radio present.
278
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Audio System
• MP3 and WMA folder mode represents
a folder structure consisting of one
level of folders. The CD player numbers
all MP3 and WMA tracks on the disc
(noted by the MP3 or WMA file
extension) and all folders containing
MP3 and WMA files, from F001 (folder)
T001 (track) to F253 T255.
• Creating discs with only one level of
folders helps with navigation through
the disc files.
If you are burning your own MP3 and WMA
discs, it is important to understand how
the system reads the structures you create.
While various files may be present (files
with extensions other than MP3 and
WMA), only files with the MP3 and WMA
extension are played; other files are
ignored by the system. This enables you to
use the same MP3 and WMA disc for a
variety of tasks on your work computer,
home computer and your in-vehicle
system.
In track mode, the system displays and
plays the structure as if it were only one
level deep (all MP3 and WMA files play,
regardless of being in a specific folder). In
folder mode, the system only plays the
MP3 and WMA files in the current folder.

DIGITAL RADIO
Note: HD Radio broadcasts are not
available in all markets.
HD Radio technology is the digital
evolution of analog AM/FM radio. Your
system has a special receiver that allows
it to receive digital broadcasts (where
available) in addition to the analog
broadcasts, it already receives. Digital
broadcasts provide a better sound quality
than analog broadcasts with free,
crystal-clear audio and no static or
distortion. For more information, and a
guide to available stations and
programming, please visit
www.hdradio.com.
When HD Radio is on and you tune to a
station broadcasting HD Radio technology,
you may notice the HD Radio logo on your
screen. When this logo is available, you
may also see Title and Artist fields
on-screen.
288
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Audio System
The multicast indicator appears in FM
mode (only) if the current station is
broadcasting multiple digital broadcasts.
The highlighted numbers signify available
digital channels where new or different
content is available. HD1 signifies the main
programming status and is available in
analog and digital broadcasts. Other
multicast stations (HD2 through HD7) are
only available digitally.
When HD Radio broadcasts are active, you
can access the following functions:
• Scan allows you to hear a brief
sampling of all available stations. This
feature still works when HD Radio
reception is on, although it does not
scan for HD2-HD7 channels. You may
see the HD logo appear if the station
has a digital broadcast.
• Memory presets allow you to save an
active channel as a memory preset.
Touch and hold a memory preset slot
until the sound returns. There is a brief
mute while the radio saves the station.
Sound returns when finished. When
switching to an HD2 or HD3 memory
preset, the sound mutes before the
digital audio plays, because the system
has to reacquire the digital signal.
Note: As with any saved radio station, you
cannot access the saved station if your
vehicle is outside the station’s reception
area.
HD Radio Reception and Station Troubleshooting
Potential reception issues
If you are listening to a multicast station and you are on
the fringe of the reception area, the station may mute due
to weak signal strength.
Reception area
If you are listening to HD1, the system switches back to
the analog broadcast until the digital broadcast is available
again. However, if you are listening to any of the possible
HD2-HD7 multicast channels, the station mutes and stays
muted unless it is able to connect to the digital signal
again.
When the system first receives a station (aside from HD2-
HD7 multicast stations), it first plays the station in the
analog version. Once the receiver verifies the station is an
HD Radio station, it shifts to the digital version. Depending
on the station quality, you may hear a slight sound change
when the station changes from analog to digital. Blending
is the shift from analog to digital sound or digital back to
analog sound.

Safety Information
WARNING
Driving while distracted can result in
loss of vehicle control, crash and
injury. We strongly recommend that
you use extreme caution when using any
device that may take your focus off the
road. Your primary responsibility is the safe
operation of your vehicle. We recommend
against the use of any hand-held device
while driving and encourage the use of
voice-operated systems when possible.
Make sure you are aware of all applicable
local laws that may affect the use of
electronic devices while driving.
When using SYNC:
• Do not operate playing devices if the
power cords or cables are broken, split
or damaged. Place cords and cables
out of the way, so they do not interfere
with the operation of pedals, seats,
compartments or safe driving abilities.
• Do not leave playing devices in your
vehicle during extreme conditions as it
could cause them damage. See your
device's manual for further information.
• Do not attempt to service or repair the
system. See an authorized dealer.
Privacy Information
When a cellular phone is connected to
SYNC, the system creates a profile within
your vehicle that is linked to that cellular
phone. This profile is created in order to
offer you more cellular features and to
operate more efficiently. Among other
things, this profile may contain data about
your cellular phone book, text messages
(read and unread), and call history,
including history of calls when your cellular
phone was not connected to the system.
In addition, if you connect a media device,
the system creates and retains an index of
supported media content. The system also
records a short development log of
approximately 10 minutes of all recent
system activity. The log profile and other
system data may be used to improve the
system and help diagnose any problems
that may occur.
The cellular profile, media device index,
and development log will remain in the
vehicle unless you delete them and are
generally accessible only in the vehicle
when the cellular phone or media player
is connected. If you no longer plan to use
the system or the vehicle, we recommend
you perform a Master Reset to erase all
stored information.

• Answering an incoming call.
• Ending a call.
• Using privacy mode.
• Dialing a number.
• Redialing.
• Call waiting notification.
• Caller ID.
Other features, such as text messaging
using Bluetooth and automatic phonebook
download, are phone-dependent features.

SYNC™ APPLICATIONS AND
SERVICES (If Equipped)
In order for the following features to work,
your cellular phone must be compatible
with SYNC. To check your phone's
compatibility, visit www.SYNCMyRide.com,
www.SYNCMyRide.ca or
www.syncmaroute.ca.
• 911 Assist: Can alert 911 in the event of
an emergency.
• SYNC AppLink: Allows you to connect
to and use certain applications such as
Pandora and Stitcher (if your phone is
compatible).
These features may require activation.
Available AppLink enabled apps vary by
market.
911 Assist
WARNINGS
Unless the 911 Assist setting is set on
before a crash, the system will not
dial for help which could delay
response time, potentially increasing the
risk of serious injury or death after a crash.
Do not wait for 911 Assist to make an
emergency call if you can do it
yourself. Dial emergency services
immediately to avoid delayed response
time which could increase the risk of
serious injury or death after a crash. If you
do not hear 911 Assist within five seconds
of the crash, the system or phone may be
damaged or non-functional.
Always place your phone in a secure
location in your vehicle so it does not
become a projectile or get damaged
in a crash. Failure to do so may cause
serious injury to someone or damage the
phone which could prevent 911 Assist from
working properly.
Note: The SYNC 911 Assist feature must be
set on before the incident.
Note: Before setting this feature on, make
sure that you read the 911 Assist Privacy
Notice later in this section for important
information.
Note: If any user switches 911 Assist to on
or off, that setting applies for all paired
phones. If 911 Assist is switched off, either
a voice message plays or a display message
or an icon comes on when your vehicle is
started and after a previously paired phone
connects.
Note: Every phone operates differently.
While SYNC 911 Assist works with most
cellular phones, some may have trouble
using this feature.
If a crash deploys an airbag (excluding
knee airbags and rear inflatable safety
belts [if equipped]) or activates the fuel
pump shut-off, your SYNC-equipped
vehicle may be able to contact emergency
services by dialing 911 through a paired and
connected Bluetooth-enabled phone. You
can learn more about the 911 Assist
feature, visit www.SYNCMyRide.com,
www.SYNCMyRide.ca or
www.syncmaroute.ca.
See Supplementary Restraints System
(page 36). Important information about
airbag deployment is in this chapter.

To make sure that 911 Assist works
properly:
• SYNC must be powered and working
properly at the time of the incident and
throughout feature activation and use.
• The 911 Assist feature must be set on
before the incident.
• You must pair and connect a
Bluetooth-enabled and compatible
cell phone to SYNC.
• A connected Bluetooth-enabled phone
must have the ability to make and
maintain an outgoing call at the time
of the incident.
• A connected Bluetooth-enabled phone
must have adequate network coverage,
battery power and signal strength.
• The vehicle must have battery power
and be located in the U.S., Canada or
in a territory in which 911 is the
emergency number.
In the Event of a Crash
Not all crashes deploy an airbag or activate
the fuel pump shut-off (the triggers for 911
Assist). If a connected cell phone sustains
damage or loses its connection to SYNC
during a crash, SYNC searches for and tries
to connect to a previously paired cell
phone; SYNC then attempts to call the
emergency services.
Before making the call:
• SYNC provides a short window of time
(about 10 seconds) to cancel the call.
If you fail to cancel the call, SYNC
attempts to dial 911.
• SYNC says the following, or a similar
message: "SYNC will attempt to call
911, to cancel the call, press Cancel on
your screen or press and hold the
phone button on your steering wheel".
If you do not cancel the call, and SYNC
makes a successful call, a pre-recorded
message plays for the 911 operator, and
then the occupant(s) in your vehicle is able
to talk with the operator. Be prepared to
provide your name, phone number and
location immediately, because not all 911
systems are capable of receiving this
information electronically.
911 Assist May Not Work If
• Your cellular phone or 911 Assist
hardware sustains damage in a crash.
• The vehicle's battery or the SYNC
system has no power.
• The phone(s) thrown from your vehicle
are the ones paired and connected to
the system.

911 Assist Privacy Notice
When you switch on 911 Assist, it may
disclose to emergency services that your
vehicle has been in a crash involving the
deployment of an airbag or activation of
the fuel pump shut-off. Certain versions or
updates to 911 Assist may also be capable
of electronically or verbally disclosing to
911 operators your vehicle location or other
details about your vehicle or crash to assist
911 operators to provide the most
appropriate emergency services. If you do
not want to disclose this information, do
not switch the feature on.
SYNC Mobile Apps
The system enables voice and steering
wheel control of SYNC AppLink enabled
smartphone apps. When an app is running
through AppLink, you can control main
features of the app through voice
commands and steering wheel controls.
Note: You must pair and connect your

Note: iPhone users need to connect the
phone to the USB port.

GENERAL MAINTENANCE
INFORMATION
Why Maintain Your Vehicle?
Carefully following the maintenance
schedule helps protect against major repair
expenses resulting from neglect or
inadequate maintenance and may help to
increase the value of your vehicle when
you sell or trade it. Keep all receipts for
completed maintenance with your vehicle.
We have established regular maintenance
intervals for your vehicle based upon
rigorous testing. It is important that you
have your vehicle serviced at the proper
times. These intervals serve two purposes;
one is to maintain the reliability of your
vehicle and the second is to keep your cost
of owning your vehicle down.
It is your responsibility to have all
scheduled maintenance performed and to
make sure that the materials used meet
the specifications identified in this owner's
manual. See Capacities and
Specifications (page 265).
Failure to perform scheduled maintenance
invalidates warranty coverage on parts
affected by the lack of maintenance.
Why Maintain Your Vehicle at Your
Dealership?
Factory-Trained Technicians
Service technicians participate in extensive
factory-sponsored certification training to
help them become experts on the
operation of your vehicle. Ask your
dealership about the training and
certification their technicians have
received.
Genuine Ford and Motorcraft®
Replacement Parts
Dealerships stock Ford, Motorcraft and
Ford-authorized branded re-manufactured
replacement parts. These parts meet or
exceed our specifications. Parts installed
at your dealership carry a nationwide
24-month or unlimited mile (kilometer)
parts and labor limited warranty.
If you do not use Ford authorized parts they
may not meet our specifications and
depending on the part, it could affect
emissions compliance.
Convenience
Many dealerships have extended evening
and Saturday hours to make your service
visit more convenient and they offer one
stop shopping. They can perform any
services that are required on your vehicle,
from general maintenance to collision
repairs.
Note: Not all dealers have extended hours
or body shops. Please contact your dealer
for details.
Protecting Your Investment
Maintenance is an investment that pays
dividends in the form of improved
reliability, durability and resale value. To
maintain the proper performance of your
vehicle and its emission control systems,
make sure you have scheduled
maintenance performed at the designated
intervals.
Your vehicle is equipped with the
Intelligent Oil-Life Monitor system, which
displays a message in the information
display at the proper oil change interval.
This interval may be up to one year or
10000 miles (16000 kilometers).
336
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Scheduled Maintenance
When the oil change message appears in
the information display, it is time for an oil
change. Make sure you perform the oil
change within two weeks or 500 miles
(800 kilometers) of the message
appearing. Make sure you reset the
Intelligent Oil-Life Monitor after each oil
change.
If your information display resets
prematurely or becomes inoperative, you
should perform the oil change interval at
six months or 5000 miles (8000
kilometers) from your last oil change.
Never exceed one year or 10000 miles
(16000 kilometers) between oil change
intervals.
Your vehicle is very sophisticated and built
with multiple, complex, performance
systems. Every manufacturer develops
these systems using different
specifications and performance features.
That is why it is important to rely upon your
dealership to properly diagnose and repair
your vehicle.
Ford Motor Company has recommended
maintenance intervals for various parts
and component systems based upon
engineering testing. Ford Motor Company
relies upon this testing to determine the
most appropriate mileage for replacement
of oils and fluids to protect your vehicle at
the lowest overall cost to you and
recommends against maintenance
schedules that deviate from the scheduled
maintenance information.
We strongly recommend the use of only
genuine Ford, Motorcraft or
Ford-authorized re-manufactured
replacement parts engineered for your
vehicle.
Additives and Chemicals
This owner's manual and the Ford
Workshop Manual list the recommended
additives and chemicals for your vehicle.
We do not recommend using chemicals or
additives not approved by us as part of
your vehicle’s normal maintenance. Please
consult your warranty information.
Oils, Fluids and Flushing
In many cases, fluid discoloration is a
normal operating characteristic and, by
itself, does not necessarily indicate a
concern or that the fluid needs to be
changed. However, a qualified expert, such
as the factory-trained technicians at your
dealership, should inspect discolored fluids
that also show signs of overheating or
foreign material contamination
immediately.
Make sure to change your vehicle’s oils and
fluids at the specified intervals or in
conjunction with a repair. Flushing is a
viable way to change fluid for many vehicle
sub-systems during scheduled
maintenance. It is critical that systems are
flushed only with new fluid that is the same
as that required to fill and operate the
system or using a Ford-approved flushing
chemical.
Owner Checks and Services
Make sure you perform the following basic
maintenance checks and inspections every
month or at six-month intervals.
337
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Scheduled Maintenance
Check every month
Engine oil level.
Function of all interior and exterior lights.

Parking brake for proper operation.
Safety belts and seat latches for wear and function.
Safety warning lamps (brake, ABS, airbag and safety belt) for operation.
Washer spray and wiper operation. Clean or replace blades as necessary.
Multi-Point Inspection
In order to keep your vehicle running right,
it is important to have the systems on your
vehicle checked regularly. This can help
identify potential issues and prevent major
problems. We recommend having the
following multi-point inspection performed
at every scheduled maintenance interval
to help make sure your vehicle keeps
running great.

your vehicle. Your checklist gives you
immediate feedback on the overall
condition of your vehicle.
NORMAL SCHEDULED
MAINTENANCE
Intelligent Oil-Life Monitor™
Your vehicle is equipped with an Intelligent
Oil-Life Monitor that determines when you
should change the engine oil based on how
your vehicle is used. By using several
important factors in its calculations, the
monitor helps reduce the cost of owning
your vehicle and reduces environmental
waste at the same time.
This means you do not have to remember
to change the oil on a mileage-based
schedule. Your vehicle lets you know when
an oil change is due by displaying a
message in the information display.
The following table provides examples of
vehicle use and its impact on oil change
intervals. It is a guideline only. Actual oil
change intervals depend on several factors
and generally decrease with severity of
use.

SYNC® Automotive Important Safety
Information Read and follow
instructions:
• Before using your SYNC® system, read
and follow all instructions and safety
information provided in this end user
manual ("Owner Guide".) Not
following precautions found in the
Owner Guide can lead to an accident
or other serious injuries.
General Operation
• Voice Command Control: Certain
functions within the SYNC® system
may be accomplished using voice
commands. Using voice commands
while driving helps you to operate the
system without removing your hands
from the wheel or eyes from the road.
• Prolonged Views of Screen: Do not
access any function requiring a
prolonged view of the screen while you
are driving. Pull over in a safe and legal
manner before attempting to access a
function of the system requiring
prolonged attention.
• Volume Setting: Do not raise the
volume excessively. Keep the volume
at a level where you can still hear
outside traffic and emergency signals
while driving. Driving while unable to
hear these sounds could cause an
accident.
• Navigation Features: Any navigation
features included in the system are
intended to provide turn by turn
instructions to get you to a desired
destination. Please make certain all
persons using this system carefully
read and follow instructions and safety
information fully.
• Distraction Hazard: Any navigation
features may require manual
(non-verbal) setup. Attempting to
perform such set-up or insert data
while driving can distract your attention
and could cause an accident or other
serious injury. Stop the vehicle in a safe
and legal manner before attempting
these operations.
• Let Your Judgment Prevail: Any
navigation features are provided only
as an aid. Make your driving decisions
based on your observations of local
conditions and existing traffic
regulations. Any such feature is not a
357
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Appendices
substitute for your personal judgment.
Any route suggestions made by this
system should never replace any local
traffic regulations or your personal
judgment or knowledge of safe driving
practices.
• Route Safety: Do not follow the route
suggestions if doing so would result in
an unsafe or illegal maneuver, if you
would be placed in an unsafe situation,
or if you would be directed into an area
that you consider unsafe. The driver is
ultimately responsible for the safe
operation of the vehicle and therefore,
must evaluate whether it is safe to
follow the suggested directions.
• Potential Map Inaccuracy: Maps
used by this system may be inaccurate
because of changes in roads, traffic
controls or driving conditions. Always
use good judgment and common sense
when following the suggested routes.
• Emergency Services: Do not rely on
any navigation features included in the
system to route you to emergency
services. Ask local authorities or an
emergency services operator for these
locations. Not all emergency services
such as police, fire stations, hospitals
and clinics are likely to be contained in
the map database for such navigation
features.
Your Responsibilities and Assumptions of
Risk
• You agree to each of the following:(a)
Any use of the SOFTWARE while
driving an automobile or other vehicle
in violation of applicable law or
otherwise driving in an unsafe manner
presents a significant risk of distracted
driving and should not be attempted
under any circumstances;(b) Use of
the SOFTWARE at excessive volume
poses a significant risk of hearing
damage and should not be attempted
under any circumstances;(c) The
SOFTWARE may not be compatible
with new or different versions of an
operating system, third party software,
or third party services, and the
SOFTWARE may potentially cause a
critical failure of an operating system,
third party software, or third party
service.(d) Any third party service
accessed by or third party software
used with the SOFTWARE (i) may
charge an additional fee for access, (ii)
may not work correctly, on an
uninterrupted basis, or error free, (iii)
may change streaming formats or
discontinue operation, (iv) may contain
adult, profane or offensive content; and
(v) may contain inaccurate, false or
misleading traffic, weather, financial
or safety information or other content;
and (e) Use of the SOFTWARE may
cause you to incur additional charges
from your wireless service provider
(WSP) and any data or minute
calculators that may be included in the
software program are for reference
only, are not warranted in any way and
should not be relied upon in anyway.
• When using the SOFTWARE, you agree
to be responsible for and assume the
entire risk to the items set forth in
Section (a) – (e) above.

• The laws of the State of Michigan
govern this EULA and Your use of the

brought and maintained exclusively in
a court of the State of Michigan

United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Michigan. You hereby
consent to submit to the personal

Binding Arbitration and Class Action
Waiver
(a) Application. This Section applies to
any dispute EXCEPT IT DOES NOT
INCLUDE A DISPUTE RELATING TO
COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT, OR TO THE
ENFORCEMENT OR VALIDITY OF YOUR,
FORD MOTOR COMPANY, OR ANY OF
FORD MOTOR COMPANY’S LICENSORS’
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.
Dispute means any dispute, action, or other
controversy between You and FORD
MOTOR COMPANY, other than the
exceptions listed above, concerning the
SOFTWARE (including its price) or this
EULA, whether in contract, warranty, tort,
statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other
legal or equitable basis.
(b) Notice of Dispute. In the event of a
Dispute, You or FORD MOTOR COMPANY
must give the other a “Notice of Dispute”,
which is a written statement of the name,
address, and contact information of the
party giving it, the facts giving rise to the
dispute, and the relief requested. You and
FORD MOTOR COMPANY will attempt to
resolve any dispute through informal
negotiation within 60 days from the date
the Notice of Dispute is sent. After 60 days,
You or FORD MOTOR COMPANY may
commence arbitration.
(c) Small claims court. You may also
litigate any dispute in small claims court
in your county of residence or FORD
MOTOR COMPANY’S principal place of
business, if the dispute meets all
requirements to be heard in the small
claims court. You may litigate in small
claims court whether or not You
negotiated informally first.
(d) Binding arbitration. If You and FORD
MOTOR COMPANY, do not resolve any
dispute by informal negotiation or in small
claims court, any other effort to resolve
the dispute will be conducted exclusively
by binding arbitration. You are giving up
the right to litigate (or participate in as a
party or class member) all disputes in court
before a judge or jury. Instead, all disputes
will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator,
whose decision will be final except for a
limited right of appeal under the Federal
Arbitration Act. Any court with jurisdiction
over the parties may enforce the
arbitrator’s award.
(e) Class action waiver. Any proceedings
to resolve or litigate any dispute in any
forum will be conducted solely on an
individual basis. Neither you nor FORD
MOTOR COMPANY, will seek to have any
dispute heard as a class action, as a private
attorney general action, or in any other
proceeding in which any party acts or
proposes to act in a representative
capacity. No arbitration or proceeding will
be combined with another without the
prior written consent of all parties to all
affected arbitrations or proceedings.
(f) Arbitration procedure. Any
arbitration will be conducted by the
American Arbitration Association (the
“AAA”), under its Commercial Arbitration
Rules. If You are an individual and use the
SOFTWARE for personal or vehicle use, or
if the value of the dispute is $75,000 or
less whether or not You are an individual
or how You use the SOFTWARE, the AAA
Supplementary Procedures for
Consumer-Related Disputes will also
apply. To commence arbitration, submit a
Commercial Arbitration Rules Demand for
Arbitration form to the AAA. You may
request a telephonic or in-person hearing
by following the AAA rules. In a dispute
involving $10,000 or less, any hearing will
be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds
good cause to hold an in-person hearing
instead. For more information, see adr.org
or call 1-800-778-7879. You agree to
commence arbitration only in your county
of residence or FORD MOTOR COMPANY’S
principal place of business. The arbitrator
360
Focus (CDH) Canada/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Appendices
may award the same damages to You
individually as a court could. The arbitrator
may award declaratory or injunctive relief
only to You individually, and only to the
extent required to satisfy Your individual
claim. Arbitration fees and incentives.
• i. Disputes involving $75,000 or less.
FORD MOTOR COMPANY will
promptly reimburse your filing fees and
pay the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and
expenses. If you reject FORD MOTOR
COMPANY’S last written settlement
offer made before the arbitrator was
appointed (“last written offer”), your
dispute goes all the way to an
arbitrator’s decision (called an
“award”), and the arbitrator awards
you more than the last written offer,
FORD MOTOR COMPANY will give you
three incentives: (1) pay the greater of
the award or $1,000; (2) pay twice your
reasonable attorney’s fees, if any; and
(3) reimburse any expenses (including
expert witness fees and costs) that
your attorney reasonably accrues for
investigating, preparing, and pursuing
your claim in arbitration. The arbitrator
will determine the amounts.
• ii. Disputes involving more than
$75,000. The AAA rules will govern
payment of filing fees and the AAA’s
and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.
• iii. Disputes involving any amount. In
any arbitration you commence, FORD
MOTOR COMPANY will seek its AAA
or arbitrator’s fees and expenses, or
Your filing fees it reimbursed, only if the
arbitrator finds the arbitration frivolous
or brought for an improper purpose. In
any arbitration FORD MOTOR
COMPANY commences, it will pay all
filing, AAA, and arbitrator’s fees and
expenses. It will not seek its attorney’s
fees or expenses from you in any
arbitration. Fees and expenses are not
counted in determining how much a
dispute involves.
(h) Claims or disputes must be filed
within one year. To the extent permitted
by law, any claim or dispute under this
EULA to which this Section applies must
be filed within one year in small claims
court (Section c) or in arbitration (Section
d). The one-year period begins when the
claim or dispute first could be filed. If such
a claim or dispute is not filed within one
year, it is permanently barred.
(i) Severability. If the class action waiver
(Section e) is found to be illegal or
unenforceable as to all or some parts of a
dispute, then that portion of Section e will
not apply to those parts. Instead, those
parts will be severed and proceed in a court
of law, with the remaining parts proceeding
in arbitration. If any other provision of that
portion Section e is found to be illegal or
unenforceable, that provision will be
severed with the remainder of Section e
remaining in full force and effect.

Introduction
This supplement complements your Focus
Owner’s Manual and provides information
specific to the Focus ST. By referring to the
pages listed in this supplement, you can
identify those features, recommendations
and specifications unique to your Ford
Performance vehicle. If there are any
discrepancies between this supplement
and the Focus Owner’s Manual, this
supplement supersedes the information

If you have any questions or concerns
regarding your Focus ST, please call the
Ford Performance Info Center at
1-800-FORD-SVT (367-3788).
PRODUCT HISTORY
The Ford Special Vehicle Team (SVT) was
established in 1991 to polish the Ford Oval
by creating low-volume, factory-produced
vehicles designed for those select few
whose idea of driving is a high-powered,
passionate experience – not just a means
of getting from point A to point B.
In a move to support this spirited
enthusiasm, Ford Motor Company carefully
integrated the wide array of talent in the
company into a small, cross-functional
group of engineers and product planners,
housed together under one roof with a
common mission: to create vehicles
specifically designed to meet the unique
needs and desires of the knowledgeable
driving enthusiast.
More than 250000 SVT vehicles have
been produced since the 1993 model year.
These include the SVT Mustang Cobra and
the Cobra R, the SVT F-150 Lightning, the
SVT Contour, the SVT Focus, Ford GT,
Shelby GT500, GT500KR and the F-150
SVT Raptor.
Team RS History
Team RS traces its roots back nearly 60
years from the Lotus Ford Cortina and Twin
Cam Escorts of the mid 1960’s, through
the first RS branded Escorts of the 1970’s
to the founding of Special Vehicle
Engineering (SVE) in 1980. Through the
1980s and 90s, SVE delivered a breadth
of vehicles from exciting XR and RS
branded road going performance cars
through homologation specials such as
the iconic Sierra Cosworth RS500. The first
ST (Sport Technology) vehicle appeared
in 1996 as the ST24 Mondeo. The first
collaboration between Ford’s European
and North American performance teams
appeared in 2002 as the ST170 in Europe
and SVT Focus in North America. In 2003,
Team RS replaced SVE in Europe as
performance car and motorsport personnel
were brought together as one team. Team
RS subsequently created the 2004 Fiesta
ST, 2005 Focus ST, 2009 Focus RS, 2013
Focus ST and 2014 Fiesta ST.
Ford Performance
SVT and Team RS officially began working
together as one team in 2009. In 2015,
these two teams, along with Ford Racing,
were formally combined, establishing Ford
Performance as a single team. Ford
Performance is responsible for all
performance- and racing-oriented
products and activities worldwide at Ford
Motor Company. This Focus represents the
best of what Ford Performance has to offer
from around the globe. Your vehicle has
been designed and developed with the four
hallmarks of Ford Performance in mind:
Performance, Substance, Exclusivity and
Value. We are proud and passionate about
what we do, and we are glad you have
made us your choice.

MANUAL TRANSMISSION
E144954
Using the Clutch
Note: During each shift, you must fully press
the clutch pedal to the floor and fully
release the accelerator. Failure to follow
this may cause increased shift efforts,
prematurely wear transmission
components, or cause gear clash or damage
to the transmission. Make sure you properly
position the floor mat so it does not interfere
with the full extension of the clutch pedal.
Note: If you attempt to shift when the drive
wheels are spinning with a loss of traction,
it is possible to cause damage to the
transmission. Do not attempt to shift when
the drive wheels do not have traction.
Note: Do not drive with your foot resting on
the clutch pedal or use the clutch pedal to
hold your vehicle at a standstill while
waiting on a hill. These actions will reduce
the life of the clutch.
Your vehicle has a twin disc clutch. Due to
the high performance of the powertrain, a
certain amount of noise from the
transmission is normal.
The manual transmission has a starter
interlock that prevents cranking the engine
unless you fully press the clutch pedal.
To start the vehicle:
1. Make sure the parking brake is fully set.
2. Press the clutch pedal to the floor, then
put the transmission in neutral (N).
3. Start the engine, then press the brake
pedal and release the parking brake.
4. Move the transmission to position 1 ,
then slowly release the clutch pedal
while slowly pressing on the
accelerator.
5. To reverse, lift up on the reverse
lockout ring found under the shift knob
and move the transmission fully to the
left and forward.
Recommended Shift Speeds for
Maximum Fuel Economy
When accelerating, upshift according to
the following chart:
Shift from:
1-2 15 mph (24 km/h)
2-3 25 mph (40 km/h)
3-4 40 mph (64 km/h)
4-5 45 mph (72 km/h)
5-6 50 mph (80 km/h)
Operating at High Speeds
Your ST vehicle is capable of high speeds
and has tires rated for the vehicle’s
maximum speed. Remember to drive
safely, obey all traffic laws and only
operate your ST vehicle at high speeds at
locations equipped and designed to do so
safely.
11
Focus (CDH) ST, Canada/Mexico/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Transmission
Before operating your vehicle at high
speeds:
• Verify correct tire pressures. See Tires
(page 20).
• Inspect wheels and tires for wear and
damage. Replace any wheels or tires
that have damage.
• Do not operate your vehicle at high
speeds with more than two passengers
or while carrying cargo.

USING STABILITY CONTROL
The AdvanceTrac® system includes
traction control and electronic stability
control. See the Traction Control and
Stability Control chapters of the Owner's
Manual for more information.
Never switch off stability control or select
sport mode when an emergency wheel or
compact wheel is fitted as spare wheel.
E194298
AdvanceTrac® provides three modes of
operation specially calibrated for the Focus
ST. These are controlled through the
AdvanceTrac® button on the center
console.

Stability Control
Enhanced Torque Vectoring
Control
Enhanced torque vectoring control is
comprised of two elements:
• Torque vectoring control, which applies
brake torque on the inner wheel in a
curve for better traction and less
understeer.
• Cornering understeer control which
controls the yaw response of the
vehicle under braking and acceleration
on high and low friction surfaces.
Unlike electronic stability control,
enhanced torque vectoring control does
not slow the vehicle. It helps control
excessive wheel slip and gives the vehicle
cornering agility. The system only increases
performance. Because of this, the system
does not disable enhanced torque
vectoring control when the AdvanceTrac®
system is off.
14
Focus (CDH) ST, Canada/Mexico/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Stability Control
ENGINE OVERSPEED
Note: Always wait until the engine is
properly warmed up before running high
engine speeds.
Your vehicle has an over-rev feature to
increase the performance range. The
standard maximum engine speed of 6500
RPM is indicated by a narrow red line on
the tachometer face. The red line becomes
thicker at the over-rev engine speed of
6800 RPM.
This feature allows three seconds of
over-rev above 6500 RPM. Once the three
second limit has been reached, the
electronically controlled rev limit ramps
down to 6500 RPM and holds there. Once
the engine speed has dropped below 6300
RPM, the over-rev timer is reset and three
seconds of over-rev up to a maximum of
6800 RPM is enabled.
Do not operate the engine at high RPM and
low load for sustained periods of time, as
damage may occur.
ENGINE OVERBOOST
Your vehicle offers a period of additional
torque delivery referred to as overboost or
overtorque. This feature of the engine
calibration broadens the RPM range of the
peak torque curve. This gives improved
performance during maneuvers such as
passing and vehicle launch.
Note: The overboost feature controls a
variety of engine parameters to deliver
additional torque. Overboost is built into the
engine calibration on your vehicle and no
action is required by the driver to engage.

Usage Summer only All season
Wheels 18 in. x 8.0 in., 55 mm offset aluminum wheels
As standard, your ST vehicle is equipped
with low profile, high performance tires
that are designed to optimize the driving
dynamics you expect in a ST vehicle. These
tires are not optimized for off-road or
winter (snow or cold weather)
performance, and the ride, noise and wear
characteristics are different than
non-performance tires. Also, because of
their lower profile, the tires are more
susceptible to damage due to potholes
and rough roads. To make sure that your
tires perform as intended, it is important
that you maintain your tires properly:
Note: Do not use tire chains on the original
wheels and tires of your vehicle. The use of
any type of tire chain on these tires may
damage your vehicle.
• Do not overload your vehicle. Maximum
vehicle and axle weights are listed on
the tire information placard.
• Take extra caution when operating the
vehicle near its maximum load,
including assuring proper tire pressure
and reducing speeds.
• Take extra caution when operating on
rough roads to avoid impacts that
could cause tire damage.
• If you encounter an abnormally harsh
impact, inspect your tires for damage.
• Inspect your tires for damage on a
regular basis. If a tire is damaged,
replace it immediately.
• Proper suspension alignment is critical
for maximum performance and
optimal tire wear. If you notice uneven
tire wear, have your alignment checked.
• When replacing tires, the only way to
maintain original performance is to use
the original equipment tire. If a different
summer tire is used, it should be the
same size, speed rating and load rating
as the originally equipped tire. Replace
tires as a set of four. Never mix tire
brands or models.
Tire Pressure
Note: You may need to remove the spare
wheel from the spare wheel well to check
the tire pressure.
• For tire pressures, see the placard
located on the B-pillar inside the
driver's door.
• Always maintain your tire pressures
according to the tire information
placard on the driver's door jamb, using
an accurate gauge.
20
Focus (CDH) ST, Canada/Mexico/United States of America, enUSA, First Printing
Wheels and Tires
• Tire pressures are specified cold. Check
them after the vehicle has been parked
for at least three hours. Do not reduce
pressure of warm tires.
• Check your tire pressure often to
maintain it properly. Tire pressure can
diminish over time and fluctuate with
temperature.
Optional All-Season Tires
Your Focus ST may come equipped with
an optional All-Season performance tire.
This choice will provide the benefit of four
season mobility without requiring the
installation of winter tires. It is important
to realize that ultimate summer
performance will be reduced relative to
the standard equipment summer only tire.
Additionally, ultimate winter traction and
control will be less than a dedicated winter
tire would provide. If you drive during the
winter months in areas with heavy snowfall
and/or hilly terrain, you may wish to install
a dedicated winter tire if ultimate traction
and control are desired.
USING WINTER TIRES
The standard equipment tires on your ST
vehicle are designed for maximum
performance in dry and wet summer
conditions. They are not designed for
winter use on ice or snow and you cannot
use them with snow chains. Ford does not
recommend using the original equipment
tires when temperatures drop to
approximately 41°F (5°C) or below
(depending on tire wear and environmental
conditions) or in snow and ice conditions.
You must use winter or all-season tires if
you will be operating your vehicle in these
conditions.
• Even with clear, dry driving conditions
do not operate your vehicle above
posted speed limits or perform high
speed maneuvers with winter tires.
• Do not use tire chains on the original
wheels and tires of your vehicle. The
use of any type of tire chain on these
tires may damage your vehicle.
The following table lists acceptable tire
sizes for winter tires. Tire speed and load
ratings should match those of the originally
equipped tires as closely as possible. If it
is required to fit winter tires with a speed
rating less than the original equipment tires
(to fit snow chains, for example), be aware
of the maximum speed rating for the tire
and never exceed.

Your ST vehicle is equipped with unique wheels matched to the tires. These wheels are
more susceptible to damage due to their diameter, width and low profile tires. To avoid
damage to your wheels:
• Maintain proper tire pressure.
• Exercise caution when using automated, commercial car washes. Hand washing or
using touchless commercial car washes without mechanical tracks is the best way
to avoid potential damage.
• When installing wheels, always torque lug nuts to specification with a torque wrench.
• Inspect your wheels for damage on a regular basis. If a wheel is damaged, replace it
immediately.
• If you encounter an abnormally harsh impact, inspect the outer diameter of your
wheels, both inside and out, for damage.

Your ST vehicle is equipped with a full-size, dissimilar spare tire assembly. Although the
spare is a traditional, full size tire (as opposed to a mini-spare), it is different in both size
and handling characteristics from the standard Focus ST performance tire. If you need
to install the spare tire, you must adhere to the following precautions:
• Because of the different performance characteristics of the spare tire, avoid aggressive
steering, braking, acceleration or high speeds when you install the spare tire.
• Never enable electronic stability control sport mode or fully disable electronic stability
control when you install the spare tire.
• Replace the spare tire with the correct original equipment specified tire as soon as
possible.

BASE WARRANTY
The Focus ST carries the same warranty
as other Ford Focus models. This
information is covered in its entirety in the
warranty information.
You can obtain warranty service for your
ST vehicle or any ST vehicle at any Ford
dealer nationwide.
Ford Global Performance does not
recommend modifying or racing ST, SVT
or RS vehicles, as they are designed and
built to be driven as delivered from the
factory. The warranty information
discusses vehicle usage and the
installation of aftermarket parts and their
effect on warranty coverage.
In the event the vehicle is intended for track
use, and the loss of warranty coverage is
not of concern, the following vehicle
durability actions are required:
• Perform multi-point inspection and the
maintenance outlined in the
150,000 mi (240,000 km) normal
maintenance schedule of the
scheduled maintenance before and
after track use. See the vehicle service
manual for removal and installation
procedures.
• Replace with Genuine Ford and
Motorcraft service parts as needed.
These actions may not necessarily protect
your vehicle from damage in competition
conditions. Subjecting your vehicle to
competition conditions even with this
recommended action may render repairs
non-reimbursable under the warranty.

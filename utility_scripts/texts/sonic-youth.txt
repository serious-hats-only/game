Tell me that you gotta show me,
Tell me that you need to slowly.
Tell me that you're burning for me,
Tell me that you can't afford me,
Time to tell your dirty story,
Time turning over and over,
Time turning, four leaf clover. Betting on the bull in the heather... Ten, twenty, thirty, forty,
Tell me that you wanna scold me,
Tell me that you adore me.
Tell me that you're famous for me,
Tell me that you're gonna score me,
Tell me that you gotta show me,
Tell me that you need to sorely.
Time to tell your love story,
Time turning over and over,
Time turning, four leaf clover. Betting on the bull in the heather... I ripped your heart out from your chest,
Replaced it with a grenade blast Incinerate, incinerate
Incinerate, incinerate The firefighters hose me down.
I don't care, I'll burn out anyhow.
It's for alarm, girl, nothing to see.
Hear the sirens come for me... You dosed my soul with gasoline,
You flicked a match into my brain. Incinerate, incinerate.
Incinerate, incinerate. The firefighters are so nice.
I remember you so cold as ice.
Now flames are licking at your feet.
Sirens come to put me out of misery... You wave your torch into my eyes
Flamethrower lover, burning mind Incinerate, incinerate
Incinerate, incinerate
Incinerate, incinerate
Incinerate, incinerate You're it
No, you're it
Hey, you're really it
You're it
No, I mean it, you're it Say it

We will fall Miss me
Don't dismiss me
Spirit desire Spirit desire
Spirit desire
Spirit desire
We will fall Spirit desire
We will fall Spirit desire
Spirit desire
Spirit desire
We will fall Spirit desire
We will fall Everybody's talking 'bout the stormy weather
And what's a man do to but work out whether it's true
Looking for a man with a focus and a temper
Who can open up a map and see between one and two Time to get it, before you let it get to you
Here he comes now, stick to your guns and let him through Everybody's coming from the winter vacation
Taking in the sun in a exaltation to you
You come running in on platform shoes
With Marshall stacks to at least just give us a clue Ah, here it comes, I know it's someone I knew
Teenage riot in a public station
Gonna fight and tear it up in a hyper nation for you Now I see it, I think I'll leave it out of the way
Now I come near you and it's not clear why you make the away Looking for a ride to a secret location
Where the kids are setting up a free-speed nation, for you
Got a foghorn and a drum and a hammer that's rockin'
And a cord and a pedal and a lock, that'll do for now It better work out, I hope it works out my way
'Cause it's getting kind of quiet in my city ahead
It takes a teen age riot to get me out of bed right now You better look it, we're gonna shake it up to him
He acts the hero, we paint a zero on his hand We know it's down, we know it's bound too loose
Everybody's sound is 'round it
Everybody wants to be proud to choose
So who's to blame for the stormy weather
You're never gonna stop all the teenage leather and booze It's time to go 'round, a one man showdown, teach us how to fail
We're off the streets now and back on the road, on the riot trail When you feel the spiral turning through alone,
And you feel so heavy that you just can't stop it...
When this sea of madness turns you into stone,
A picture of your life shoots like a rocket all the time... Put me in the equation, it's all right.
I've seen you moving in and out of sight.
My friends tell me it'll all cut through you,
From nowhere to nowhere.
Cut together, cutting through. I'm island-bound, a mote inside my eye,
And I can't see you breathing as before.
I am airless -- a vacuum child.
I can't stand to reason at your door in this time. Put me in the equation, it's all right.
I've seen you moving in and out of sight.
My friends tell me it'll all cut through you,
From nowhere to nowhere.
Cut together. I'm down in the daytime out of sight,
Comin' in from dreamland, I'm on fire.
I can see it's all been here before.
Dream a dream that lies right at your door. When the seasons circle sideways out of turn,
And words don't speak, just fall across the carpet,
You're just in time to watch the fires burn.
It seems a crime but your face is bright, you love it all the time... You're perfect in the way
A perfect end today
You're burning out their lights
And burning in their eyes
I love you, sugar kane
A-comin' from the rain
Oh, kiss me like a frog
And turn me into flame
I love you all the time
I need you 8 to 9
And I can stay all night
Your body shining And I know
There's something down there, sugar soul
Back to the cross a twisted lane
There's something down there, sugar kane I'm back again in love
I'm back again a dove
Where'd you get your light
Your smilin' sugar life
Another lovers day
Another cracked up night
Every night I say
The light is coming And I know
There's something down there, sugar cone
Back to the cross a twisted lane
There's something down there, sugar kane Hey angel, come and play
And fly me away
A stroll along the beach
Until you're out of time
I love you, sugar kane
A crack into the dream
I love you, sugar kane
I love you, sugar kane
I love you, sugar kane
I love you, sugar kane
I love you, sugar kane
I love you, sugar Ev'ry thing's
All right
And then
She's all the time
In my neighborhood
She cries both
Day and night
I know because
It was there It's a milestone
But she's down
On her luck
And the day
Makes her lonely
And it's so hard
To buck
I was there I believe
That she'd stop him
If she would
Start to care
I believe
That she'd look
Upon this side
And t' care
And I'd go
By the something
When she's on my way
But I don't belong there No I don't belong to her
I don't belong to anybody
She's my prize
Forsaken angel
But she don't care
She cries
She's
A lone-hearted mystic
And she can carry on When I'm there
She's all right
But she's not
When I'm gone
Heaven knows
That the answer
She's don't call
In no one
She's a wave
A thing, beautiful
She's mine
For the one And I'm also
Hesitating
By temptation
Lest it runs
Which it
Don't follow me
But I'm not there
I'm gone Now I'll cry tonight
Like I cried
The night before
And I'll feast
On her eyes
But I'll dream
About the door
So long
Jesus, Savior
Blind faith
Worth to tell
It don't have
Consolation
She's my I was born to love her
But she knows
That the kingdom waits
So high above her
And I run but I race
But it's not
Too fast a pace Of course
I'll not deceive her
I'm not there, I'm gone
It's all about confusion
And I cry for her (kim) Best + sexy what was it anyway

All the girls there playin' on a jelly roll. Time to take a ride,
Time to take it in a midnight eye.
And if you wanna go, get on below.
Pinkin' out the day, dreamin' out the crazy way.
Finger on the love, it's all above. Everywhere it's six-sex-six by luck,
A satellite wish will make it just enough.
You be makin' out with a witch in a coffee truck. Time to rock the road, and tell the story of the jelly rollin'.
Dirty boots are on, hi-de-ho.
Pinkin' out the black, dreamin' in a crack.
Satan got her tongue, now it's undone. I got some dirty boots,
Yeah, dirty boots.
I got some dirty boots, baby, dirty boots.
Ha! [Kim]
Every time you look my way

A blast in the underworld I stick a knife in my head
Thinkin' about your eyes
But now that you've been shot dead
I've got a new surprise I've been waiting for you just to say
He's off to check his mind
But all I know is you got no money
But that's got nothing to do with a good time Can you forgive the boy who shot you in the head?
Or should you get a gun and go and get revenge?
100% of my love up to you, true star
It's hard to believe you took off

And all you men are slime

And you'll love me too
But you'll never know
What I feel inside
That I'm really bad
Little trouble girl
Remember mother? 
We were close
Very, very close
Sha la la you taught me how to fit it good
Sha la la flow down life you understood
Sha la la curl my hair and eye lash
Sha la la hitch my cheeks and do my lips
Sha la la swing my hips just like you
Sha la la smile and behave
Sha la la a circle of perfection, it's what you gave
Sha la la then one day I met a guy
He stole my heart, no alibi
Sha la la he said: "romance is a ticket to paradise"
Sha la la momma, I'm not too young to try
Sha la la we kissed, we hugged, we were close
Very, very close
Sha la la we danced in the sand
And the water rose - higher and higher
Sha la la until I found myself floating - in the sky
I'm sorry mother, I'd rather fight
Than have to lie
If you want me to
I will be the one
That is always good
And you'll love me too
But you'll never know
What I feel inside
That I'm really bad

I don't have the will I love you metallic blue
I love you golden blue
I miss you shining all alone
I miss you I don't know what to do
I don't glitter like the stars above
I don't glow like neon alone
Don't blush it's just the wind outside
Don't rush to be by my side I went away to see an old friend of mine
His sister came over she was out of her mind
She said Jesus had a twin who knew nothing about sin
She was laughing like crazy at the trouble I'm in
Her light eyes were dancing she is insane
Her brother says she's just a bitch with a golden chain
She keeps coming closer saying "I can feel it in my bones
Schizophrenia is taking me home"
My future is static
It's already had it
I could tuck you in
And we can talk about it
I had a dream
And it split the scene
But I got a hunch
It's coming back to me [Thurston]
Whoahooh!

you better watch yourself when you jump into it
'cause the mirror's gonna steal your soul I wonder how it came to be my friend
that someone just like you has come again
you'll never, never know how close you came
until you fall in love with the diamond rain throw all his trash away
look out he's here to stay
your mirror's gonna crack when he breaks into it
and you'll never never be the same look into his eyes and you can see
why all the little kids are dressed in dreams
I wonder how he's gonna make it back
when he sees that you just know it's make-belief blood crystalized to sand
and now I hope you'll understand
you reflected into his looking glass soul
and now the mirror is your only friend look into his eyes and you will see
that men are not alone on the diamond sea
sail into the heart of the lonely storm
and tell her that you'll love her eternally time takes its crazy toll
mirror fallin' off the wall
you better look out for the looking glass girl
'cause she's gonna take you for a fall look into his eyes and you shall see
why everything is quiet and nothing's free
I wonder how he's gonna make her smile
when love is running wild on the diamond sea "Ha-ha... okay, dog..." [Kim]
Turquoise boy, I must confess to you,
sweet liberation has come
You are a legend in a lovely game,
but now I feel I must run Turquoise boy, the sky is calling me
Sweet isolation in the sun
You are a soldier in a sad charade
How do you lose what's never found? Turquoise boy, I must confess to you,
sweet liberation has come
You are a legend in a lovely game,
but now I feel I must run "[Lee]
this she did in public for us to see
she came in here too drunk to do the show
between the trains and cars
broken glass and lost hub-caps, images of a gun
row house row house pass through
let the city rise up to fill the screen
clothes flung out of closets, doorknobs falling off
the guitar guy played real good feedback, and super sounding riffs
with his mild mannered look on, yeah he was truly hip
the girl started out in red patent leather
very I'm in a band with knee pads
we watch her fall over and lay down,
shouting the poetic truths of high school journal keepers
row house row house pass through, let the city rise up
twister, dust buster, hospital bed, I'll see you, see you
see you on the highway
now we're told so merge ideas, of song forms and freedom
miss seafood, miss cheesecake, a couple of miss donuts
the edge of a blade pressed to the throat of your reflected image
poised, yet totally screwed up
yes sir, yes sir, step right up none of us know, where we're trying to get to
what sort of live where we trying to build
now we're told so merge ideas, of song forms and freedom
seasons out of life, nothing is out of reach
L.A. is more confusing now, than anywhere I've ever been to
I'm from New York City, breath it out and let it in where are you now?
when your broken eyes are closed
head in a cloudy dream, green and sailboats
borrowed and never returned
emotions, books, outlooks on life hello 20 15! hello, 20, 15! " [instrumental] Coming down

Always cast a pair of hose
spaces pressed together rose
arms around each others back
you know that i liked you Jack
and all the other boys who pose
a silent dance in the woods
in this love of bite that's shown
another can of coca cola
don't you ever call me Mom
freckled dancing in the plant
and air so thin I wanted time
as far as you can see it's fun
you're nothing but a history
a second here and then you're gone
quicksand quicksand all around
turn the corner just beyond
the shadows move and change the groove
and something tells me not to brood
turning round and that's a show
you're walking through my heart once more
don't forget to close the door
i'm not certain what you found
all the men want a charming word/whore
like a crown full of jewels
sunny skies and angels please
falling down upon my knees
that wasn't how its supposed to be
clear blue eyes, just as tries
the wind is busy blowing dizzy
you're dreams were shot like a star
exploding in a mind somewhere
doing something on a dare
pulling a trigger like breathing air
a sunkissed boy that gave no thought
to what he'd made while others saved
ocean spreads a candle said/candle's head
it's dripping in my hand, you're dead
little brother reminding me
moments take forever tree
you can see as far as sin
don't you know the shape i'm in
you're walking through my heart once more
don't forget to close the door sing yr children
yr children song
sing yr love child
love is on
see thru child eyes
eyes are old
and old is magic growing
see the child lights
spinning gold
everyday girl
they blow away
leaves falling to the water
wildflowers
for you today
sing yr birthday
yr birthday blues
sing yr wild light
wildflowers bloom
they will not forget you
and down/they go
to sleep/so slow
away/they grow
they go
i wait/i wait all day
sing yr love child
love is on
sing yr child lights
sing yr child lights
lights are gold
sing yr child life

ticket to die, ticket to ride the junk star
shielded in white, Kansai girl in black dew Tokyo eye, Tokyo crying somewhere
seeking inside, supermen sighing nowhere
soaking in my eye, soaking in my eye grey leaf
she dig to cry, she dig to cry love funny
fur in the eye, Kansai girl is kiss teen
fun in the light, crying away to sun bear [Thurston]
My violence is a dream
a 'real dream'
a skinny arm
a crush on living sin
my violence
is a sleeping head
nodding out to rising bliss
I left home for experience
carved 'suk for honesty' on my chest
my violence is the number
coming out of prayer
find it in the father
find it in a girl there's a thing in my memory
hoilding on for dear life
with a feeling of secrets
beating up under my flesh
my tongue is tied
I'm sleeping nights awake
Tom violence is a dream
coming out of a girl [Thurston]

in my family brave men run
away from me Dreamin', dreamin' of a girl like me.
Hey, what are you waiting for?
Feedin, feedin' me.
And I feel like I'm disappearing, getting smaller everyday,
But I look in the mirror, and I'm bigger in every way. She said, "You aren't never going anywhere."
She said, "You aren't never going anywhere."
"I ain't never going anywhere."
"I ain't never going anywhere." I'm in Heaven now.
I can see you, Richard.
Goodbye, Hollywood.
Goodbye, Downey.
Hello, Janis.
Hello, Dennis, Elvis, and all my brand new friends.
I'm so glad you're all here with me until the very end. Dreamin', dreamin' of how it's supposed to be,
But now this tunic's spinning around my arms and knees.
I feel like I'm disappearing, getting smaller everyday.
But when I open my mouth to sing, I'm bigger in every way. She said, "You aren't never going anywhere."
She said, "You aren't never going anywhere."
"I ain't never going anywhere."
"I ain't never going anywhere." Hey Mom, look! I'm over here!
I finally made it.
I'm playing the drums again, too.
Don't be sad - the band doesn't sound that bad.
And I remember, Mom, what you said.
You said, "Honey, you look so underfed." Another green salad, another iced tea.
I feel like I'm disappearing, getting smaller everyday.
But I look in your eyes, and I'm bigger in every way. She said, "You aren't never going anywhere."
She said, "You aren't never going anywhere."
"I ain't never going anywhere."
"I ain't never going anywhere." Goodbye, Richard, gotta go now.
I'm finally on my own, but Dan's got a gig.
Keep the love lights glowing.
Little girl's got the blues.
I can still hear Mama say, "Honey, don't let it go to your head." im here for you

NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! hey! hey! where you're goin' in such a rush

And that's all right with me
I see you run to make a call
Putting up to someone free Your life and my life they don't touch at all
And that's no way to be
We've never seemed so far What's real? What's true?
I ain't turning my back on you
Where're you goin'? Where've you been?
Making wishes, watching dreams It might be simple, it might be true
I might be overwhelmed by you
You might be empty
The way your eyes just look right through It's such a mess now anyway
Wish fulfillment every day
I don't believe you
Now I can't hear a word you say I see you shaking in the light
Reading the headline news
The others they're not quite so right
We want them to choose you
I could almost see your face tonight
Singing simple rhythm'n'blues
You'll always be a star Shake it baby
Come on scream
Just seen your face in a magazine
Don't doubt it
Leaves 'em sore
I can't stand it anymore
It's my favorite shot of you
You look so pretty your eyes were true
I'm still on your side
In spite of everything you do We're only blood on blood on life
You paint me pictures every night
Come wish beside me
Don't you know you know what's right I see a dog star divin' at his magic, snatchin'
Keeps me up awake, go crystal cracking
I can't wait, I can't stay, a candle
Gotta change my mind before it burns out I'm the cocker on the rock
Wind is whipping through my stupid mop I see a falling snowgirl walking Broadway
Turns the corner at 14th and I know there's no way
It's alright, it's alight candle
And I know she'll be okay by Sunday I'm the cocker on the rock
Humming bash starts shining in your electric clock It's safe to say, "Candle, tonight's the day, candle"
It's alright now, candle, the wind's away, candle
Never thought I'd see a dog star falling I'm the cocker on the rock
Wind is whipping through my stupid mop [Mike Watt]
"Watt Here! I'm downstairs from your window... if you're up...
pub 'phone booth... if you're up...(I get tense) [Beep]" [Mike Watt]
"Thurston! Watt! Thurston! I think it's ten thirty, we're calling
from Providence, Rhode Island. Did you find your shit? You gotta
watch the motin' Thurston, your fuckin' memory just goes out tha window.
We couldn't find it in the van at all, we wonderin' if you looked in
that trash can. When we threw out that trash, man, was the bag in
your hand, did you dump it? Call later. Bye." Hey, gimme hollow stimulation,
It's so sleazy to be free.
Let's invest in dull creation,
Thrill city, cheap legacy. What a waste, you're so chaste.
I can't wait to taste your face. Vapid signals lead me to you,
A sublime spectacular dud.
Safe and sound from chatter confusion.
Get the picture, yes, it's clear as mud. What a waste, you're so chaste.
I can't wait to taste your face. Hey, gimme hollow stimulation,
It's so sleazy to be free.
Let's invest in dull creation,
Thrill city, cheap legacy. What a waste, you're so chaste.
I can't wait to taste your face. I wouldn't lead you on ever since your song, yeah.
You could have had it all, but you didn't call me. 1997, suburbia soundtrack, geffen [kim]

Moist roll of hundreds
Fingers thru yr hair
Silver quarters drop
To yr pleated skirt Cannisters of whipped cream
In yr sweater pockets
A look of space and total life
Ready or not
The plan is to go to dc and hang out

There's no doubt, you're in deep
Your throat is tight, you can't breathe
Another kiss is all you need You'd like to think
That you're immune to the stuff, oh, yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
Gonna have to face it, you're addicted to love Tongue is tied, can't read
You're runnin' at a different speed
Your heart beats in double time
Another kiss and you'll be mine A one track mind, you can't be saved
Oblivion is all you crave
If there is some for you
You don't mind if you do You'd like to think
That you're immune to the stuff, oh, yeah

[Thurston]
by the way, go out not today
move back along and wait a long long time
nothing running free, you gotta time it all
run out the door come back when you score
new times will come and you will see a door
into the lion eye and now I'm gone
and it's out
and it's not what you thought it was about
but a life, that you know
will keep you bound in sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
sometimes you got still the blues for me
I could run away, a long time to stay
burn out your eyes, burn out surprise
look out today you know it's not the same
it's all the rage, it's every day
and it's out
and it's not what you thought it was about
but a life, that you know
will keep you round in love I got a catholic block
Inside my head
I let it go to work
Bring it all back home It serves you right
And I can motor down
You got to earn yourfreedom
Get it on my own I just live forever
There just is no end
I just trust the oppression
Like I trust your friends I got a catholic block
Inside my head
I let it play around
Iron to gold Come back to me awhile I got a catholic block it's around my head
I got a catholic block and it's blood orange red
I got a catholic block do you like to fuck?
I got a catholic block guess I'm out of luck You keep me coming home again...
You keep me coming home again... When you were gone, I met a friend.
She taught me how to live in the end. You keep me coming home again...
You keep me coming home again... Are her eyes brown or blue?
How does she keep her static cool?
My heart and soul are rocked up in her eyes.
A little blink I recognize...
A little blink, yeah, that's my prize.
A white horse sittin' right there by her side.
Hard to ignore, hard to disguise.
When will she ever realize? You keep me coming home again...
You keep me coming home again... When you were gone, I was out of my mind.
I had a friend who laughed all the time.
I had a friend who cried all the time.
I had a friend who screamed all the time.
I had a friend who lied all the time. We're gonna kill the California girls
We're gonna fire the exploding load
In the milkmaid maidenhead
We're gonna find the meaning of feeling good
And we're gonna stay there
As long as we think we should
Mystery train
Three way plane
Expressway to your skull
Mystery train
Three way plane
Expressway to your skull
Mystery train
Three way plane
Expressway
To your skull So messed up, I want you here
In my room, I want you here
Now we're gonna be face-to-face
And we lay right down in my favorite place Now I wanna be yr dog
Now I wanna be yr dog
Now I wanna be yr dog Well, Come on Now I'm ready to close my eyes
But now I'm ready to close my mind
And now I'm ready to feel your hand
And lose my heart on the burning sand Now I wanna be yr dog
Now I wanna be yr dog
Now I wanna be yr dog Well, Come on Shit, don't be a fool girl, he's takin' me all the way
We're going to burn you up, you're all going to burn me up
Got to, real life, you make me feel stupid
Wish it was five minutes before yesterday Do you remember the time we were gonna do that?
Sweetheart, come here, bring me all your food, honey
Dying, dying, do you wanna fuck me?
No, bring me all your food, don't be a fool, girl The lotto made our American dream come true
Don't go in the water, dying, dying, got to, it's real life
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I don't remember what it was like yesterday, was there a yesterday G-force, eight, ninety-nine, seventy-nine, ninety-five
The ice ballet, sleeping beauty, she's a real jogger
What becomes a mirror shade most? Huh C'mon, girl, we're gonna burn you, you're contaminated
Something's out there, look, don't you see?
Something used to be out there, I have it all in this book
Do you wanna fuck me? We used to go to the place, tell you what I'm gonna do
I'll make you an offer, don't do that, what's it gonna be, pal
Don't be a bully, just 'coz I'm a girl, do I make you feel silly?
Do you see the tall one? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to just sound like that, honey
You can pick up that phone, call packer?
And all your troubles will be over
I just hope it was worth it As soon as the sun goes down, he's going into town
And he's gonna play pool, got to, it's real life
She always told me he would somehow, I didn't believe her
I'll tell you one thing though, I think it's going to rain tomorrow Produce, we've been asked to participate
In a Madonna rocker that can reactivate
We're Ciccone Youth from New York City
Make the feature cut next week 'cuz it's a Tuff Titty Now I know my rhyme ain't bustin' no chime
'Cuz my rap be crappy like a homeboy's slime
His name is Mike Watt, he's gonna get caught
Some knucklehead defiance to the group at New Alliance Fuck yeah, Fuck yeah [Lee]
Stretch me to the point where I stop
Run ten thousand miles and then think of me
I think you know the place we should meet
Don't worry if it's dark and I'm late Run me out a thin wire
Help me to kill this, love
I'll join you tonight at the bottom of the well
Just feel around in the dark until you get the idea I'm not moving doesn't mean I can't
Flame on in my head
My best friend sucked his wife's blood an shriveled up
He was mistaken for sane We move and groove and cut loose from fear
We should kill time, we'll shut it down
I've got a pipeline straight to the heart of you
Opening in my head Bright glass on a chain being wound around us
The toiling of idle hands
Dripping,
with guilt
A secret form of punishment
Axes through skulls
Shadow of futility
Endless
Revolt
The shining of light and shadows Dividing each existence
No one is right
Nothing is solid
Nothing can be held in my hands for long Discontinuity
Sandy beaches
Bridges sinking into the sea
Beautiful confusion
You're a fading memory We should kill time We had just left shore
When everything began to happen at once
The water came in and we started to go down
I looked at Jill and she looked back
Thinking it would be alright to go down Then the railings broke and the motors gave out
The hall emptied out and no one was left for the band
The amps all wet, speakers burst, soaked We up three flight now
Tried to meet up with the galley crew
But it seemed everyone had gone
We had a smoke to pass some time Jill said, "I'd love to right now"
What could I say, we did while the waters rose, licking our feet
It was fun and funny so we laughed
I loved the way she could laugh, so full bodied When we hit the sky we were high over the grooves
A field of gnarled antennas coiling upwards
Waves and waveforms joining in a nice hot blast
So different from the boat The cold silver sky opened for us and we passed through
Last I saw of Jill
She was heading into the coils of the antennae
Laughing, so beautiful Saying she hadn't yet had her fill
Of the boys there and the electricity
Saying she wanted to plug in again and fry a bit
I said, "Watch the water, love" She kept laughing and shook her hair
She said, "I'd love to, right now you know"
So we did and had a smoke too and her lips parted There in amongst the coiling snakes of an antenna
She looked right at home
The waves came up and a blinding flash
Caught me dreaming of her As she looked all crossed with wires and sparks
Watching the blast
Everything went orange and all my thoughts
Dissolved inwards in the cloud
I thought one last, how different from the sea is the boat Heard your name the other day
It's been a long long time
Ancient history some would say
Another state of mind
You smell of memory
Felt tipped electric child She takes the plastic pill, she plays "The Weatherman"
She screams "Religion kills more than it saves a man"
She painted filigrees, she was the Acid Queen
She claims "Society is just a fever dream" Now you live in the trees and salty seas
Trippin' out in the blue skies
You shut the door on everythin'
Too busy gettin' high
And me, just another dream theory
Lost inside your eyes She's not in your history books, lost her mind and kept her looks
Down beneath the radar screen, she's lit up like gasoline
Been through a million kicks, lookin' for the one that sticks
Never would've known it then, I might not see her again Top hat and tails for thrills
Red lips and famous hands
Sidelong and glancin' still
In tiny dancer land We kissed, time slipped
Hard edged tight lipped
See you sometime
Ask me if I care
For Karen
Miss Communication
Karen
Karen [Instrumental] That's what you should do, you should be Dinosaur's manager
Y'know Dinosaur has like ten managers
They don't have any other managers
They have like are you kidding? They have a manager in every city It'd be such an easy job though to just tell them what to do, I think
Yeah but, it's like, they want you to do everything else
Like they're that kind of band like they don't wanna do anything Yeah but that's easier to do everything than to just do some of it
It's easier y'know
That's true and have somebody else
And then have somebody else fuck up what you've done
By doing part of your job it's like easier just to do the whole thing In some ways I think like somebody like Redd Kross
Would be easy to manage 'cause they'd just be so like
"Well, whatta we do now?"
And you just tell them and that would be it They just wanna rock
Yeah right they don't wanna do anything
They just wanna be rock gods, y'know So let's call J
Okay
Hello, is J there?
Oh um can you just tell him Kim and Susanne called
Okay, thank you, bye [Steve]
Good evening and hi everybody

and he's so in love with you lyrics by kim [thurston]
falling out of sleep, i hit the floor
put on some rock tee and i'm out with the door
from bowery to broome to greene, i'm a walking lizard
last night's dream was a talking baby lizard
All comin' from hu-man imagination
day dreaming days in a daydream nation
Smashed-up against a car at three a.m.
kids just up for basketball, beat me in my head
there's bum trash in my hall and my place is ripped
i've totaled another amp, i'm calling in sick
It's an anthem in a vacuum on a hyperstation
day dreaming days in a daydream nation (kim)
Kids cruise away, pack of chickenshits
This guy is ours, dark stains on his pants
Enough to make a butcher out of the bone
Take a walk in the park? shit, yeah! A poor boy, a rich boy
A poor rich boy coming right through me
Rich boy, poor boy
Poor rich boy coming right through me

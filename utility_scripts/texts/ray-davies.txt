There's a room in a house, in a street in a manor in a borough
That's part of a city that is generally referred to as London
It's a dark place, a mysterious place And it is said that if you're born within the sound of Bow-Bells
You have the necessary qualifications to be christened a Londoner
(It's a cruel place, it's a hard place) But when you think back to all the great Londoners
William Blake, Charles Dickens, Dick Whittington
Pearly kings, barrow boys, Arthur Daley, Max Wall
And don't forget the Kray twins But if you're ever up on Highgate Hill on a clear day
You can see right down to Leicester Square
(London, London) Crystal Palace, Clapham Common, right down to Streatham Hill
North and South, I feel that I'm a Londoner still
(London, London) Chiswick Bridge to Newham and East Ham
Church bells ring out through the land
You were born in London, England
(London, London, through the dark alley-ways
And passages of London) And there's a tap by a reservoir, leading to a stream
That turns into a river estuary that eventually opens to the sea
(London, London) And there's a docker by a wharf, sending cargo overseas
Unloading foreign trade from a large ocean vessel
In the mighty metropolitan port of London
(London, London, through the dark alley-ways
And passages of London) When I think of all the Londoners still unsung
East-enders, West-enders, Oriental-enders
Fu Manchu, Sherlock Holmes, Jack Spock, Henry Cooper
Thomas A'Becket, Thomas Moore, and don't forget the Kray twins There's a part of me, that says, "Get out"
Then one day, I'll hear somebody shout
"Sounds to me like you come from London Town" But if you're ever up on Highgate Hill on a clear day
I'll be there
(I'll be there)
Yes, I will be there
(There) Through the dark alley-ways and passages of London, London
London, London, through the dark alley-ways
And passages of London, London
London, London, through the dark alley-ways
And passages of London, London You're asking me, "what's it leading to?
Will we live a long life, will it treat us fair?"
No point asking me because I haven't got a clue You're asking me, "will it be alright?"
If you're asking me don't take my advice
And don't make me responsible
For you living your life I could say there will be laughter, you will never cry
I could just as easily go tell a lie, couldn't I, yeah
What would come after, that would be unwise
If that's what you really want
Then get a life, get a life, get a life You're asking me, "will it be alright?"
Because I've been around, I have the insight
And I was there the first time so I must know what it's like
If you're asking me, don't take my advice Do we learn from all the questions that we ask
Do we listen to the past, we never do
It's up to you to go and make your own mistakes
Have a go and break a leg
But please don't come home crying when you do You're asking me, don't take my advice
Because I've been there before
Doesn't come to pass
That I have all the answers to the questions that you ask
I'm telling you because you're asking me Anyway, what am I supposed to say
Could say everything is really brilliant
Anything to make your worries disappear
Put your conscience in the clear
And make you think there's nothing left to fear You're asking me, "what's it leading to?
Will we live a long life, will it treat us fair?"
No point asking me because I wasn't even there First time around it was really grand
But inside something said to me
Go get a life, get a life
Now that I'm here I can't understand
Why anyone is asking me, if I could give a damn
I could say there will be laughter, you will never cry
I could just as easily go tell a lie, couldn't I?
Then what would come after, that would be unwise
If that's what you really want then
Get a life, get a life, get a life
If you're asking me, don't take my advice I met her in a club down in old Soho
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like Cola cola
C-O-L-A cola. She walked up to me and she asked me to dance.
I asked her name and in a dark brown voice she said, "Lola"
L-O-L-A Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy,
But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine
Oh my Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola Well, I'm not dumb but I can't understand
Why she walk like a woman and talk like a man
Oh my Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola Well, we drank champagne and danced all night,
Under electric candlelight,
She picked me up and sat me on her knee,
And said, "Little boy won't you come home with me?" Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy,
But when I looked in her eyes,
Well I almost fell for my Lola,
Lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola Lola lo lo lo lo Lola lo lo lo lo Lola I pushed her away. I walked to the door.
I fell to the floor. I got down on my knees.
I looked at her, and she at me. Well that's the way that I want it to stay.
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola.
Lo lo lo lo Lola. Girls will be boys, and boys will be girls.
It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world,
Except for Lola. Lo lo lo lo Lola. Well I left home just a week before,
And I've never ever kissed a woman before,
But Lola smiled and took me by the hand,
And said, "Little boy, gonna make you a man." Well I'm not the world's most masculine man,
But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man,
And so is Lola.
Lo lo lo lo Lola. Lo lo lo lo Lola. Lola lo lo lo lo Lola. Lola lo lo lo lo Lola I'll tell you a story to pass on to the end
As told to me so long ago by my good friend
As we hollowed? round the log fire
We laughed the whole night long
As he told me a tale, passed on to him
By a wanderin' vagabond My friend told me the story
And I'll pass it on to you
It was handed down this century
And he swore that it was true And in the morning I could see him fade
Was it fact or fiction? Who can say?
(Storyteller)
I believe ev'ry word you say
(Storyteller)
I bet you told a good tale in your day He tried to tell the people
But the people wouldn't hear
Him spinning yarns
And telling tales from yesteryear Then he smiled and finished his story
He said, "Will you pass it on for me?"
(Storyteller)
I'll tell that tale for you
(Storyteller)
Somehow I'll get your message through My friend told me the story

And I swear that it is true Are you going on Thanksgiving Day
To those family celebrations?
Passing on knowledge down through the years
At the gathering of generations Every year it's the same routine
All over, all over
Come on over, it's Thanksgiving Day Papa looks over at the small gathering
Remembering days gone by
Smiles at the children as he watches them play
And wishes his wife was still by his side She would always cook dinner on Thanksgiving Day
It's all over, it's all over
It's all over the American way
But sometimes the children are so far away And in a dark apartment on the wrong side of town
A lonely spinster prays
For a handsome lover and a passionate embrace
And kisses all over, all over
All over her American face It's all over, it's all over, it's all over 'Cause today she feels so far away
From the friends in her hometown
So she runs for the Greyhound
She'll spend hours on the bus but she'll reach town
For Thanksgiving Day Come on over, come on over
Come on over, it's Thanksgiving Day
Come on over, come on over
Come on over, come on over
Come on over, it's Thanksgiving Day At a truck stop a man sits alone at the bar
Estranged in isolation
It's been a while now and he seems so far
From those distant celebrations He thinks back to all the mistakes that he made
To a time when he was so young and green
Innocent days when they both looked forward to that
Great American dream Now it's all over, it's all over, all over
And all over America people are going home
On Thanksgiving Day Now Papa looks out of the window
The sight brings a smile to his face
He sees all his children coming back home
Together on this special day Come on over, come on over
Come on over, it's Thanksgiving Day
Come on over, come on over
Come on over, it's Thanksgiving Day
Come on over, come on over
Come on over, it's Thanksgiving Day
Come on over, come on over
Come on over, it's Thanksgiving Day Dirty old river, must you keep rolling
Flowing into the night
People so busy, make me feel dizzy
Taxi light shines so bright And I don't need no friends
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise Every day I look at the world
From my window
But chilly, chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine Terry meets Julie, Waterloo Station
Every Friday night
I am so lazy, don't want to wander
I stay at home at night But I don't feel afraid
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise Every day I look at the world
From my window
Chilly, chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine Millions of people swarming like flies
'Round Waterloo underground
But Terry and Julie cross over the river
Where they feel safe and sound And they don't need no friends
As long as they gaze on Waterloo sunset
They are in paradise Dirty old river, must you keep rolling
Flowing into the night
People so busy, make me feel dizzy
Taxi light shines so bright But Terry and Julie cross over the river
Where they feel safe and sound
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise
Waterloo sunset's fine You better top up your suntan
Otherwise your skin is going to turn to leather
We'll make a movie in Vietnam
The tax break said, 'We're going to shoot on location' The rug says, 'Made in Korea'
Manufactured in a factory using cheap labor
And all over Asia
The third world becoming a major league player Mass production in Saigon
While all the workers laid off in Cleveland
Hot jacuzzi in Taiwan
With empty factories in Birmingham
Now it's baby boomers in Hong Kong
And cowboys in Vietnam making their movies Big confusion in Hollywood
Now it's American Major League in Japan
Hamburgers in China with sushi bars in Maine and Boston
The dollar signs said, 'Expand on it'
Cowboys in Vietnam making their movies Wake up in the White House
Zip up your pants and gather together
Take a look at your overseas neighbor
Look at their strange behavior Take a look at your wigwam
Inside it says the product is Asian
Once it was only in movies
Now it's a product invasion Mass production in Saigon
While all the workers laid off in Cleveland
Hot jacuzzi in Taiwan
With empty factories in Birmingham
Now it's sweatshops in Hong Kong
Dressing cowboys in Vietnam making their movies
Let's make up movie in Vietnam You better top up your suntan
Looks like we're in for heavy weather
Economic meltdown
Nobody said it would last forever Let's make a movie in bad debt
Take the culture out to the third world
Blow up the grand new civilization
In the name of globalisation Big confusion in Hollywood
Now it's American Major League in Japan
Hamburgers in China, with sushi bars in Maine and Boston
Dollar signs said, 'Expand on it'
Cowboys in Vietnam making their movies Watch out!

I'm thinking of the days,
I won't forget a single day, believe me. I bless the light,

And though you're gone,
You're with me every single day, believe me. Days I'll remember all my life,
Days when you can't see wrong from right.
You took my life,
But then I knew that very soon you'd leave me,
But it's all right,
Now I'm not frightened of this world, believe me. I wish today could be tomorrow,
The night is dark,
It just brings sorrow anyway. Thank you for the days,
Those endless days, those sacred days you gave me.

Days. Mr. Jones, my next door neighbour
I feel I've known you all my life
I haven't seen you for a while now
How's the family? How's that beautiful wife?
I hope your dreams were not forgotten
And you've become downtrodden Get your health together
Get your wealth together
Get yourself together
Jones, you were my next door neighbour Mr. Brown, you're so ambitious
You ran off with an Essex blond
You've broke the bank to keep two women
You're over extended, now it's all gone wrong
Now you're right back where you started
Still, you shouldn't be broken hearted Get your mind together
We can still climb together
A step at a time together
Brown, your world was turned upside down I know it's not the same
And everything changes
But behind front doors people think that they can hide
We win and lose, we laugh and cry
Live and learn, at least we try
Oh, give it a try Ba ba ba, together
Ba ba ba, together
And we can go miles together
All of my next door neighbours Get your style together
Put a smile together
And we'll go miles together
All of my next door neighbours Mr. Smith, another story
I wonder what became of him?
They say he threw the telly through the window
He went bizerk and jacked the whole world in
They say he may have hit rock bottom
Still, he went out with a bang and so he is not forgotten We had our tiffs together
Our rows and our rifts together
But let's learn to forgive together
Smith, you were my next door neighbour
Jones, you were my next door neighbour
Brown, you were my next door neighbour (Ray Davies) Wakin' up, feeling rough
Totally stressed
Every day it's a dead[?] time
Step by step
Hit a wall, took a fall
To a new depth
Count to ten, focusin'
Take a deep breath In a world that is close to breakin'
I thought that you were my friend
In a world that is full of hatin'
And[I'm?] about to descend
I just smile and pretend[?] I'm a million miles away from it all
And let it go right over my head
Let 'em chase and the winner take all
And let it go right over my head
Over my head, yeah
Over my head
Over my head Everywhere, everyone
Questioning me
Are you ill? Are you well?
Do you like being free? Didn't know you were close to breaking
So you thought it should end
Left it all for a new location
So you could start up again
So keep keep smilin' till then Right now I want some peace of mind
So let it go right over my head
Just want to give myself a little more time
And every single word that you said
Went over my head, yeah
Over my head
Over my head Little girl I was so mistaken
Thought that you were my friend
In a world that is full of hatin'
I'm about to descend
Didn't know you were close to breakin'
So you thought it should end
Left it all for a new location
So you could start up again
So keep smilin' till then I'm a million miles away from it all
And let it go right over my head
Let 'em chase and the winner take all
And let it go right over my head
Right now I want some peace of mind
So let it go right over my head
Just want to give myself a little more time
And every single word that you said
Went over my head, yeah
Over my head
Over my head Close the door, let me please
Get to my bed
I wanna take stock, see my life
In perspective
Tomorrow I'll be back in the race, till then
Live and let live
So let all the anger pass me by
Over my head
Over my head
Over my head Things are gonna change
This is the morning after
When reality bites
The morality kicks in
To those damaged limitations This is the morning after
All that went before
All of the song and laughter
The morning after, gets up from the floor
To do it all again But things are gonna change
This is the morning after
My turn to get pushed in the face
Feeling right down, resurrecting the clown
Yeah I bloody well will
You look around for which way to go
But where you gonna turn? And when the morning after
Pleads to take no more
We patch up the last disaster
Slower, faster, crawl out through the door
And do it all again
But things have gotta change
This is the morning after You feel shite, the air bites
Oh will I ever learn?
Your ear's deaf, your girl's left
Never to return
But it's the morning after
All that went before
And now you paid your debt
Get up you wreck, and crawl out through the door
Oh, love will return This is the morning after
You will learn
The barrier we cross
Is somewhere between Heaven and Hell
Ah, but the world will never change
So we must dig inside, and crawl outside ourselves
I will, I bloody well will
Things are gonna change Things are gonna change
This is the morning after I will, I bloody well will
Things are gonna change (Ray Davies) Lift yourself out of the doldrums
Make yourself a cuppa tea
Drag your emotions out of the gutter
Don't wallow in self pity When you wake up, all of a fluster
Thinking life has passed you by
Give yourself a kick up the backside
Jump out of bed and punch the sky Is there life after breakfast
Full of possibilities
Is there life after breakfast?
Yes there is, after breakfast
So don't live in agony
Is there life after breakfast?
Yes there is, after breakfast Cheer up some, put on the kettle
There's no point in being down[?]
Make your mind up, try to forget her
Boil the tea and I'll be [?] Is there life after breakfast?
Yes there is, after breakfast
So don't live in agony
Is there life after breakfast?
Yes there is, after breakfast After breakfast
Life after breakfast
After breakfast Just because all of the plumbing
Isn't all it used to be
Turn the tap, see, a little bit's coming
That must make you feel relieved Don't turn into a total embarrassment
To your friends and family
Get out of bed, the whole day's ahead
So take the pills and drink your tea Is there life after breakfast
Full of possibilities
Is there life after breakfast?
Yes there is, after breakfast
So don't be so depressive
Is there life after breakfast?
Yes there is, after breakfast Is there life after breakfast
Full of possibilities
Is there life after breakfast?
Yes there is, after breakfast
Is there life after breakfast?
Is there life after breakfast? Put the kettle on, mate I was walking on the coast road
When the harbor came in view
It was there I saw the hilltop
That I used to walk with you We'd sing of the old country
Now it's such a lonesome climb
Our world faded once when you were mine Why is true love so difficult to find
Wish you were here to see it with me
One more time
Lalalala lalalala lalalala lala
Wish you were here to sing it with me
One more time Those economic vultures
Stole our dreams and told us tales
Then they towed away our culture
To their depot in south Wales Corporations get the tax breaks
While the city gets the crime
The profit's going somewhere
But it isn't yours or mine Still we blindly trust in the divine
Let's sing for the old country
Come on, one more time
Lalalala lalalala lalalala oh oh
Let's sing it loud with feeling
Come on, one more time You know I must be leaving
And I know you've got to stay
But you know that I'll be grieving
When you're so far away And if this should be the last time
I should ever see your face
Let's part with no hard feeling
And a positive embrace And I will speak well of you
When they ask when you were mine
Till then the jet stream up above
Shows us the warning signs Till we meet again bravely walk the line
Let's sing it loud with feeling
Come on, one more time
Lalalala lalalala lalalala oh oh
Let's sing for the old country
Come on, one more, one more time Dear sir or madam, I don't normally write to the press
But the neighborhood where I grew up is really quite depressed
Society is crumbling but the media's obsessed with boobs, bums
Dot-com millionaires, fame, fashion, FTSE shares
But people they couldn't care less While parliamentary yobbos shout abuse around the house
Do-gooders and reformers lead our nation to defeat
While murderers and terrorists get compassionate release
You're out now, you're back on the street, yeah, back on the street That's why I remain yours truly, confused N10 I close my eyes and lay back and I think of England
I dream about that green and pleasant land we knew as England
That throne of kings, that sceptred isle set in a silver sea
Has turned into a laughing stock divided without harmony That's why I remain yours truly, confused N10 The burglars have ransacked all the houses in the street
While Mercs and Posches double park with sheer impunity
When towed away the ponces plead to all and sundry
Referee, what about me? So forgive my lack of confidence and total low esteem
But the dog eat dog society has deemed us all has-beens
While our smiling bland spin doctors slyly lead us down the track
To a stab in the back I'm much too terrified to go out at night but the television's boring
They're vandalizing all the cars on the street
But I won't lay down and take defeat That's why I remain yours truly, confused N10 Thank you, goodnight Girl, you really got me goin'
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin'
Yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night Yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin', now
Oh yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night You Really Got Me
You Really Got Me
You Really Got Me See, don't ever set me free
I always wanna be by your side
Girl, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night Yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin', now
Oh yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night You Really Got Me
You Really Got Me
You Really Got Me
Oh no... (Solo) See, don't ever set me free
I always wanna be by your side
Girl, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night Yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin', now
Oh yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night You Really Got Me
You Really Got Me
You Really Got Me I wanna make my home
Where the buffalo roam
In that great panorama My baby brother and me
In the land of the free
Americana In my schoolboy world
I always get the girl
On that great silver screen
'Cause since I was a teen
Ya' know I had this dream
Americana
Oh Runnin' high on inspiration
Taken from those Wild West heroes
Full of expectations of the road
On that windin' trail to somewhere
Young and foolish though he did not care
What dangers lay in store and so In the steps of the great pioneers
For (?) I can't understand how I'm gonna
Get there from here
Wherever it goes, it's gonna take me somewhere Americana
Kentucky Moon
Montana sky
Sierra, Nevada (?)
But it's a long long time
Americana I wanna make my home where the buffalo roam
Oh There's no place that I would rather be
The whole wide world doesn't mean so much to me
For this is where I belong
Oh, this is where I belong Tell me now if you want me here to stay?
It don't matter 'cause I'd stay here anyway
For this is where I belong
Oh, this is where I belong I ain't gonna wander
Like the boy I used to know
He's a real unlucky fella
And he's got no place to go How does it go?
This is where I belong, oh yeah I won't search for a house upon a hill, no, no, no
Why should I when I'd only miss you still?
For this is where I belong
Oh, this is where I belong
This is where I belong This is the end, this is the last time,
Take what you want, why wait a lifetime?
Why wait till tomorrow when you can just take it today,
And it's not far away. Live all your life according to a plan.
Live by the rules the best way you can.
So the system that fed you and bred you can throw you away,
And it's not far away,
Not far away. Oh, oh.
The system that fed you and bred you can throw you away,
And it's not far away,
Not far away,
Not far away,
Not far away, Oh, oh.
The system that breeds[?] you and feeds you will through you away.
And it's not far away,
Not far away. Oh, oh.
Total chaos, total destruction.
(Not far away, not far away.)
Social collapse, moral corruption.
(Not far away, not far away.) I feel it in my bones, it gets closer each day.
The future is here, and it won't go away. They're gonna segregate the people,
They're gonna put you in your place.
And no one's gonna listen when you try to plead your case.
And those who think they are immune will get slapped in the face. Chaos will rule,
No one will be safe,
The ending is near,
And it's not far away. The future is here and it's ours to dictate,
The ending is closer so why hesitate,
Oh, oh. The ending is near, and it's not far away. (Ray Davies) You caught me with my pants down
But I was only taking a shower
Still you looked for the evidence
Like the smell of perfume, or lipstick on my collar
You're always suspicious, and terrified I'd made a mistake
We are such creatures of little faith
We are such creatures of little faith And when I come home late, you always ask me
"Have you been drinking?"
"I swear I've been working"
You say I'm lying as if you know just what I'm thinking
You say you don't trust me, and you quiz me till I finally break
Oh, we are such creatures of little faith
Such creatures of little faith You say that love is blind
I wish you were out of sight, and out of mind
I take you out fist fighting[?]
But still I find you keep looking for those telltale signs I didn't mean to follow you,
But I suspected you were meeting somebody
I was playing detective
Thought you were fooling around, now it's too late to say I'm sorry
Still I'm optimistic, my trust has not been betrayed
Forgive me
I'm still a sad creature of little faith
We are such creatures of little faith And all we need
All we need
All we need is a little bit of faith
We are such creatures of little faith
Such creatures of little faith Don't you know that
A little bit of faith can be such a beautiful thing? Hey, my friend
You can't run away from time
They say you can't fight fate
Time won't wait
You can't run away from time And time is the avenger
But why should we just surrender to it?
Why go through it? Run, run, run, run, run, run, run away
Let's run away from time
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run away Girl, you and me
We've got to set ourselves free this time
We must try to escape
Because it's never too late
Liberation is ours to find Hey, hey, let's run away
Let's run away from time
Hey, hey, let's run away Hey, girl
Let's run away from time
We've still got mountains to climb
A day at a time
It's never too late, so why should we wait? Take me, save me, maybe, baby
Run, run, run away
Run, run, run away
Run, run, run away The world is too obsessed
By the continual quest
For the fountain of youth
They will never find And time is the avenger
But why should we just surrender to it?
Why go through it? Run, run, run, run, run, run, run away
Let's run away from time
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run away
Run, run, run away
Run, run, run away Run, run, run away
Run, run, run away Rock n' roll cowboys where do you go now?
From the final shootout at the OK Corral
Do you give up the chase like an old retiree?
Or do you stare in the face of new adversaries Night falls the coyote calls underneath a full moon
"Heeyah" is the final call at the Last Chance Saloon
Your time's passed, now everyone asked for your version of history
Do you live in a dream, or do you live in reality? Rock n' roll cowboys on the ol' wagon train
You had your time but it won't come again
You rode the prairie and ya' always stood proud
So tall in the saddle and your head was not bowed Where are the natives who come to our aid in our hour of need
And where are the great ones that kneaded through brambles no a victory
Got so many questions, so little time but it's still a mystery
Do we live in a dream, or do we live in reality? Do you live in a dream, or do you live in reality? All she wrote was a goodbye letter
"It's over for us, to tell you the truth
I've met this person in a disco
He's really special, reminds me of you "Now you can mix in those swinging circles
Single bars and gay cafes
With pickup lines to impress young schoolgirls
And big Australian barmaids" That's all she wrote
On the back of that old brown envelope
A few killer lines to get my goat
That's all she wrote All she wrote on that goodbye letter
"It's over for us, to tell you the truth
And my new man is a vegetarian
He laughs a lot, not like you" Picked up one of her old love letters
"You are such a caring man"
Such a change from that cold, bitter scam
Of what I was, and what I am That's all she wrote
On the back of an old brown envelope
A few killer lines to get my goat
That's all she wrote "Did you ever really love me?
Did you ever really care?
Now you're free to live your fantasy
And I'm not there
To cramp your style and blow your cover
Now you're free to take your lover
To titty bars and low life clubs" All she wrote is a goodbye letter
"It's over for us, to tell you the truth
I've met this person in a disco
He's really special, reminds me of you "So don't pretend to be a new man
Be chauvinistic, that's your way
Now you're free to make your play
For that big Australian barmaid
(Big Australian barmaid)
Big Australian barmaid" That's all she wrote
On the back of that old brown envelope
A few killer lines in that suicide note
That's all she wrote The natives are getting restless in the tropical heat
Work is scarce and children play while the dogs fight in the street
And in the hotels all the tourists dine on local fare
While the waiters stand and stare And in the street taxi cabs crawl around for vice
To the sound of the tourists in the casino
Rattling the dice, money money I'm just another tourist checking out the slums
With my plastic Visa drinking with my chums
I dance and swing while ABBA sing
And I flash my Platinum
To the sound of Livin' La Vida Loca
Yes, Livin' La Vida Loca While in the heat of the street
The native beats his drum
Take the money 'cause it's just another tourist
Having lots of fun Oh let's go to the Mardi Gras
Oh let's kiss the Blarney Stone
Oh let's hear the Wailing Wall
Oh the Empire State is so very tall
And the Taj Mahal really has a pretty dome
And everywhere that I go I say
I want to make it my home I'm just another tourist checking out the slums
With my plastic Visa drinking with my chums
Money money You danced and partied at the Mardi Gras
Threw back all the beads at the parade
Fake worlds and logos in the shopping mall where you came from
Everything seemed the same the whole world now So you headed down south, left your old home town
Relocated so far away from the real world
But where is the real world? Get out of the bar and follow the stars
Now you've relocated so far away from the real world
But where is the real world? Ambitious eyes set firmly on the future
So keen to leave your old home town
But you're a lost soul looking for the great illusion in another state
You had to escape, you know you just couldn't wait
You thought the real world let you down So you headed down south, left another home town
Now you don't have the time to think
Who's left behind in the real world Watching game shows all day was no kind of deal
It all seemed oh so surreal had to break from the real world
But where is the real world? One day you'll wake up and you will feel
I am alive, this is real Your friends came down to visit from all over
To see first hand the brand new start you made
But you were overqualified for the tips you earn in a bar
It won't work here and it didn't work there but you tried it anyway So head off in the car and follow the stars
There's someone waiting not far away in the real world Hope you get there this time but just bear in mind
There's a lot of lost souls looking out for a sign for the real world
But where is the real world? One day you'll wake up and you will feel
I am alive, this is real I don't believe that God is a man with white hair
Sitting in a big chair
Judging the world and its morals
Forgiving today so we can sin again tomorrow But I believe I need something to look up to
I believe I wanna pray but don't know what to I'm not a born again preacher
My soul's too far gone to be saved
The world is wild and at this stage
We need a hymn for a new age Oh have you heard the news
Bible bashers where are the queues
A saint played a gig but he got crap reviews
The punters didn't like the product or the venue I need something to connect to
Someone to help me through
Something I can pray to This is my hymn for a new age
Rewrite the book on a fresh page
If I'm to find God and be saved
I need a hymn for a new age (We need a hymn for a new age) The invader's arrived now here comes the war
Satan keeps knocking at my door
Time has come for a new crusade
Cast out the evil before they blow the world away We need a hymn
I believe
I need something to look up to
I believe I wanna pray but don't know what to We need a hymn for a new age
Rewrite the book on a fresh page
If I'm to find God and be saved
I need a hymn for a new age We need a hymn for a new age Each man build your own cross
For every soul that's ever been lost
Life is cheap people take it at no cost
We need a hymn for a new age Is this really it? Is this the final station?
It's really been quite a trip You know it's been great to watch the sights
Playing the edited highlights
And all the out-takes you did not see
Were only my unreality I am, I am imaginary
I am, I am imaginary
I'm the imaginary man, imaginary man
Yes, I am imaginary, imaginary I was always in your head
Trade your expectations
And always let it be said I offered my very best to you
Gave you my dreams towards [Incomprehensible]
Then vowed you in all my crazy [Incomprehensible]
And took you to places you never seen Walked down to Preservation Hall
Looking for the old trad band
It was just a momentary glance I saw my reflection in the glass
Watched as the world went flashing past
I knew the face but could not tell
Why I couldn't recognize myself? I am, I am imaginary
I am, I am imaginary
I'm the imaginary man, imaginary man
Yes, I am imaginary, imaginary I'm the imaginary man
Imaginary man, imaginary man
Yes, I am imaginary, imaginary
Imaginary man, imaginary man Why is it difficult to get things done
In the age of computers and communication?
The powers that be say they can't keep a hold
Of a world that is escalating out of control Out on the street there's a war going on
And everything is going wild
But a bureaucrat says, "We've lost your file
So we'll put you on hold for a while" Hey man, call the D.A.
Call the National Guard, call the president
Call anyone in the land of the free
'Cause they ain't gonna listen to me Call the P.D., the emergency? vacuation
The Dalai Lama, Kofi Annan
And they ain't gonna listen to me The voice on the phone says, 'We'll get right back'
But they say all the computers are down
And the chief prosecutor had to go out of town
No one listen, nobody listens, no one listens to me Now we've got you in the system
Somebody's gonna get back to you
Then in a few more years we'll give your case a review
No one listen, nobody listens, they ain't gonna listen to me Hey man, call the Government
Write to City Hall, United Nations
Tell the preacher at the missionary
'Cause they ain't gonna listen to me Blame the hurricane, blame the drug trade, the economy
Blame the ghettos in the land of the free
'Cause they ain't gonna listen to me
They ain't gonna listen to me Everybody knows it's a cryin' shame
How the little guy gets kicked around
Everybody I talk to agrees that if you wanna get heard
It's connections that count I was minding my business
When a bad situation occurred, shock, horror and fear
Now the outcome is still unclear
Hey man, I am the innocent party here
They ain't gonna listen to me Tell the National Guard
Tell the talk show on the TV
Tell the winos in the old man bar
? Cause they ain't gonna listen to me Now I'm stuck here in their system
They ain't gonna listen, nobody listens
They ain't gonna listen to me Listen to my heartbeat
Yeah, all fall down
Someone help me
Off of the ground
Listen to my heartbeat
Yeah, all fall down
Someone help me
Off of the ground Nelson and Starr
He's got ten grandkids
She's the third missus
He grooves around
Intensive care
Strutting his stuff
He's got a perfect mullet
Hanging down his back
And Starr walks in
Gives a little wiggle
Makes old Nelson grin
He tucks me in
Touches my feet
"Hey buddy, you know
You got a slow heartbeat" Listen to my heartbeat
Yeah, listen to my heartbeat
And the marching band
Plays along
Plays the morphine song
On the charity ward
Yeah, the marching band
Plays its song Yeah, all fall down
Someone help me
Off of the ground
Yeah, all fall down
Someone help me
Off of the ground And opposite me
Brenda the alkie
Coughs so deep
It's the drugs
And the drink
It could happen to anyone
Sure makes me think
And the bed beside her
Is full of cables and leads
Nobody visits
Nobody grieves Listen to my heartbeat
Yeah
Listen to my heartbeat Nelson and Starr
He's got ten grandkids
She's the third missus
Starr takes some blood
Out of my arm
Rolls me over
Just like that
Listen to my heartbeat
Slow but clean
While Brenda the alkie
Looks so mean
They wheel her out
She starts to cry
"If I don't get better
I'm gonna die
I'll go cold turkey
Till I'm clean
I'll go to jail
But you get the morphine" Listen to my heartbeat
Lalalala, lalalala
Yeah, listen to my heartbeat
Lalalala, lalalala

Plays in the morgue
At the charity ward

Yeah, all fall down
Someone help me
Off of the ground Now I don't mind if fifty thousand yobos pick(? beat?) me up outside a
Football ground on a Saturday afternoon. I'll still come out fighting.
D'you know why? You've seen me on television. I'm the lowest common
Denominator. And this is all about your(yob?) culture. So welcome to jolly
Ol' England! I'm the stand up comic. Jack the Lad has become Oscar Wilde
And the followers of style say it's the latest thing
And William Shakespeare is the schmooze of the week
And anyone who says different is a fuckin' antique
And Noel Coward has become very hard(?)
And the comic says "bollocks" and everybody laughs
And that's that Style, I mean
Never was much, never has been
But the little bit that was was all that we had
And the clown does a belch and we all belch back
And that's that Jack the Lad has become Fancy Dan
And creating agro(?) culture with a rub-on tan
And all the tearaways(?) have got savior faire
And the working class hero's got a tinted hair(?)
And a well-spoken hero from a yesteryear
Walks out onto a stage and they all shout "queer!"
And that's that Manners, I mean
Never was much, never has been
But the little bit that was was all that we had
And now the clown does a fart and we all fart back
And that's that Stand up, stand up
Can you hear me at the back?
All you wide (white?) boys standing in a row
And the comic shouts
And we all shout back
And the mob says "follow" so we go Stand up, stand up
Can you hear me at the back?
All you wide (white?) boys standing in a row
And the comic shouts
And we all shout back
And the mob says "follow" so we go
And that's that What do you think of it so far?
I knew you'd say that
You've been watching too much television
Together now! Jack the Lad has become Oscar Wilde
And the followers of style say it's the latest thing
And William Shakespeare is the schmooze of the week
And anyone who says different is an antique
And Noel Coward has become very odd(?)
And the comic says "bollocks" and everybody laughs
And that's that Style, I mean
Never was much, never has been
But the little bit that was was all that we had
And the clown does a belch and we all belch back
And that's that All together now!
Stand up, stand up
Can you hear me at the back?
All you wide (white?) boys standing in a row
And the comic shouts
And we all shout back
And the mob says "follow" so we go Stand up, stand up
Can you hear me at the back?
All you wide (white?) boys standing in a row
And the comic shouts
And we all shout back
And the mob says "follow" so we go
And that's that Well, I'm going down the pub now. You're welcome to join me if you
Like but I know you won't. You've all been watching too much
Television. Well I'll be in the public bar, minding my own business. Every time I hear that lonesome train
Roll down the track
Going away to unknown destinations I believe there's someone out there
Making the great escape, just moving on
Suddenly gone and so unexpectedly It might hit you on a sunny afternoon
Without a warning there's a thought
It just comes over you And it's a shadow on a sidewalk
Someone like you
In a blink of an eye, waving goodbye
It's time you made your getaway In a suburb somewhere
Someone's quietly planning their getaway
Traveling light, in case they might
Get a change of heart It's the bravest move they'll ever make
But they have to make the break
That's the risk that they take
So don't hesitate, then so unexpectedly It might hit you on a sunny afternoon
Without a warning there's a thought
It just comes over you And it's a shadow on the sidewalk
Someone you knew
It's time you made your getaway It might hit you on a sunny afternoon
Without a warning there's a thought
It just comes over you And it's a shadow on the sidewalk
Someone like you
It's time you made your getaway You'll make the great escape
Get out that door before it's too late
Hear that lonesome train
The lonesome train Everybody's a dreamer
And everybody's a star
And everyone's in movies
It doesn't matter who you are There are stars in every city
In every house and on every street
And if you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Their names are written in concrete Don't step on Greta Garbo
As you walk down the Boulevard
She looks so weak and fragile
That's why she tried to be so hard But they turned her into a princess
And they sat her on a throne
But she turned her back on stardom
Because she wanted to be alone You can see all the stars
As you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Some that you recognize
Some that you've hardly even heard of People who worked
And suffered and struggled for fame
Some who succeeded
And some who suffered in vain Rudolph Valentino
Looks very much alive
And he looks up ladies' dresses
As they sadly pass him by Avoid stepping on Bela Lugosi
'Cause he's liable to turn and bite
But stand close by Bette Davis
Because hers was such a lonely life You can see all the stars
As you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Some that you recognize
Some that you've hardly even heard of People who worked
And suffered and struggled for fame
Some who succeeded
And some who suffered in vain Everybody's a dreamer
And everybody's a star
And everybody's in show biz
It doesn't matter who you are But those who are successful
Be always on your guard
Success walks hand in hand with failure
Along Hollywood Boulevard You can see all the stars
As you walk along Hollywood Boulevard
Some that you recognize
Some that you've hardly even heard of People who worked and suffered
And struggled for fame
Some who succeeded and some
Who suffered in vain I wish my life was a non-stop
Hollywood movie show
A fantasy world of celluloid
Villains and heroes 'Cause celluloid heroes
Never feel any pain
And celluloid heroes
Never really die Everybody's a dreamer
And everybody's a star
And everybody's in movies
It doesn't matter who you are (Ray Davies) I just had a really bad fall
And this time it was harder to get up than before
I shouted to the heavens and a vision appeared
I cried out "Can you help?", it replied "Not at all" After the fall is over
You'll be on your own
After the fall is over There'll be wrecks to clear in this war zone
There'll be much to clean and time to atone
But while it's dark you can shelter here
In the bleak midwinter when you're feeling the fear
Ah, but when the mist clears, the sun will shine again A life's gotta have direction
After the deals are done
You gotta ask the question Ask yourself why you go through it all
When morality kicks in, who will catch you when you fall
I'm a sinner waiting at the traveler's rest
Seeking refuge from the storm, and I'm a grateful guest
And a profit cries out in high platitudes
I smile and say, "Hey, I was just passing through"
And an angel cries, "Wait, we'll tell you when to move"
Even at the gates of Heaven I'll be waiting in a queue Seems like I'm falling upwards
Into the great white blue
And all my imperfections You can learn your lines and fabricate a show
But the way we come in, yeah, that's the way we're gonna go
We cheat and lie to conquer our fears
We can put on a smile just to cover up the tears
Ah, but when the mist clears, the sun will shine again After the fall (after the fall is over)
There'll be a better day
After the fall is over So I fell on my arse, now I'm feeling the pain
But the feeling will pass and so will the shame
The bigger the ego, the bigger the fall
When your reputation counts for nothing at all
Ah, but when the mist clears, the sun will shine again I will greet you when the sun shines again
After the fall (after the fall is over)
There'll be a better day
After the fall is over Look at all the people around me,
Same old faces joining the queue.
For return to Waterloo,
Return to Waterloo. Started off this morning as usual,
Checkin' out the mail and all the bills to pay.
Maybe something special's gonna happen,
Maybe this is my lucky day. The forecast says heavy weather,
So take your umbrella just in case.
Will I get away, will I see it through,
On the return to Waterloo. Return to Waterloo.
Return to Waterloo. Somehow you feel that the world's been passin' you by.
Can't help thinkin' somehow they're living a lie.
Now I'm asking questions, I never thought I'd ask them before,
Like "why" or "how" or "what am I doing it for?" Will I reach my destination,
Or will I get off along the way?
Will I reach my destination? Will I reach my destination,
Have I stopped or am I only going slow?
Have we got a couple more stations,
Or is this as far as we all go? The headlines cry out from the papers,
"Inflation," "murder," "wars," who really wants to know?
If I return to Waterloo,
It'll cost me more in 1992. Will I get away,
Will I see it through?
And come back home to you,
On the return to Waterloo. I am a dull and simple lad
Cannot tell water from champagne
And I have never met the Queen
And I wish I could have all he has got
I wish I could be like David Watts And when I lie on my pillow at night
I dream I could fight like David Watts
And lead the school team to victory
And take my exams and pass the lot Wish I could be like David Watts
Wish I could be like David Watts
Wish I could be like David Watts
Wish I could be He is the head boy at the school
He is the captain of the team
His is so gay and fancy free
And I wish all his money belonged to me
I wish I could be like David Watts And all the girls in the neighborhood
They try to go out with David Watts
They try their best but can't succeed
For he is of pure and noble breed Wish I could be like
Wish I could be like
Wish I could be like
Wish I could be like Wish I could be like
Wish I could be like The day before I left New Orleans
My neighbor from down the street, Alex Chilton
Came to say goodbye
We talked about songs and how much joy they'd given us
Before we left, he confided in me
"Playin' songs is ageless
The song's never seem to grow old
You can sing a song that you wrote when you were a kid
And it's like the first time you've played it
It cheats time and makes you feel safe
But the reality is that things are changing in the world" As we talked the TV channel began playing an old
Black and white cowboy film
We sat there and looked at the TV
Even though the sound was turned down
We didn't need to speak anymore
The images said it all See my friends,
See my friends,
Layin' 'cross the river, See my friends,
See my friends,
Layin' 'cross the river, She is gone,
She is gone and now there's no one left
'Cept my friends,
Layin' 'cross the river, She just went,
She just went,
Went across the river. Now she's gone,
Now she's gone,
Wish that I'd gone with her. She is gone,
She is gone and now there's no one left
'Cept my friends,
Layin' 'cross the river, She is gone and now there's no one else to take her place
She is gone and now there's no one else to love
'Cept my friends,
Layin' 'cross the river, See my friends,
See my friends,
Layin' 'cross the river, See my friends,
See my friends,
Layin' 'cross the river, Here's wishing you the bluest sky
And hoping something better comes tomorrow
Hoping all the verses rhyme
And the very best of choruses to follow
Follow all the doubt and sadness
I know that better things are on the way Here's hoping all the days ahead
Won't be as bitter as the ones behind you
Be an optimist instead
And somehow happiness will find you
Forget what happened yesterday
I know that better things are on the way It's really good to see you rocking out
And having fun, living like you just begun
Accept your life and what it brings
I hope tomorrow you'll find better things
I know tomorrow you'll find better things Here's wishing you the bluest sky
And hoping something better comes tomorrow
Hoping all the verses rhyme
And the very best of choruses to follow
Follow all the drudge and sadness
I know that better things are on the way I know you've got a lot of good things happening up ahead
The past is gone, it's all been said
So here's to what the future brings
I know tomorrow you'll find better things
I know tomorrow you'll find better things Here's wishing you the bluest sky
Wishing you the bluest sky
Hoping all your verses rhyme
Hoping all your verses rhyme
I hope tomorrow you'll find better things Sunlight and the city is barely awake
As all the early morning drifters make their way
Headlights in the distance, too bright for my eyes
Still I love the dusk, the dawn, between times
They are mine ? Cos you can't tell if it's day or night
Do we see the moon or the sunlight?
Everything around is so transitional
Momentary lapse of rational Walking past the writing on the wall
Something apocalyptic
Then a momentary lapse of faith
Before I become more optimistic Like a momentary loss of sight
Fleetingly it went so wrong from right
In a second it can change from night to day
Any second love can turn to hate Sunlight and the city is barely awake
As all the seconds in our lifetime drift away
So live every moment and hold me so tight
A second changes day to night I had a momentary loss of sight
Fleetingly it went so wrong from right
In a second you would change your point of view
In my hesitation I lost you It only takes a moment sometimes
The difference between joy and pain
In a second you can look away
Turn around to find it's all changed Because you can't tell if it's day or night
Do we see the moon or the sunlight?
Everything around is so transitional
Momentary lapse of rational Like a momentary loss of sight
Fleetingly it went from dark to light
In a second it can change from night to day
But in a moment hope will find the way When I'm far away
In some godforsaken place
That I'm passing through
When my emotions turn to blue
I think of you Living day to day
Building up the debt
Heavy in excess
Getting in over your head
Vicarious Wish I could set you free
Over the insanity
Imagining you and me
Flyin' on the Wings of Fantasy Ah, on the Wings of Fantasy Live in denial
Chasin' the dream
Livin' the illusion on
The Wings of Fantasy And up above a solitary Eagle flies
Symbolizing our forgotten dream
So high in the sky
But down here I just wonder why
Am I part of nature's scheme
Or just a man in a machine
Burning on a turning wheel Hold tight, things are growin' cold inside ya' never known
Cut to the rawhide right to the metal bone
Strap a live (?) across your knees to the back (?) where your jawbone freezes
Bitter bad lightning freeze Who needs to ride a train
When we got the natural motion
That's gonna take us right across the line
(?) that you ever see
Whoa, oh
Hey, look at that big sky
Look at that moonglow lightin' up the Rockies
On the way to Idaho
Take out your fiddle put your hand on the bow
Rustle up through the tune put a rhythm in your toe-o Ray speaking:
Hello? Is anybody there? Hello? I can't explain
And I'm letting my emotions get the better of me
Your always on my mind
But I can't tell you that I willingly follow you
If I can't have you
How can I expect to have a place in your heart?
But I wouldn't be so bold
As to expect that you have feelings for me, oh no
Can I get it to you (West to East, under the stars)
(?) I have to admit defeat
(It's a thousand miles to the nearest bar)
An' I wouldn't want to bother you
(West to East, 'til we reach Valhalla)
'Cause then I won't have to admit I'm alone (West to East)
It's bothering me (In the land of the free) See the sign up ahead, see the moon behind
(Place in your heart)
You were right on time with gonna' get there come rain or shine
You're always on my mind
(In Omaha city)
Soon be over the (?)
I can't tell you that I'd really follow you
I can't admit it to you (West to East, under the stars)
'Cause then I will have to admit defeat
(It's a thousand miles to the nearest bar)
And I wouldn't want to bother you
(West to East 'til we reach Valhalla)
'Cause then I won't have to admit I'm alone
(West to East)
It's bothering me
(In the land of the free) See the sign up ahead
See the sign up ahead, see the moon behind
(Place in your heart)
You were right on time with gonna' get there come rain or shine
You're always on my mind
(In Omaha city)
Soon be over the (?)
To expect you to have feelings for me Make the most of nature's great highway
Rest (?) night turn into day
Moved so fast to (?)
A place in your heart Ray speaking:
Alright lads, I gotta phone home Man speaking: Hey, Ray. What's the deal?
Let's get this show on the road Alright then I can't explain
(Come get a train)
Am I let my emotions get the better of me
(Take a? across a? plain)
You're always on my mind
But I can't tell you that I really may follow you
To the end of the earth West to East, follow that star
Thousand miles to the nearest bar
Rattlin' wind, hold on tight
Rap (?), it'll blow you apart
Pass that whiskey, stoke up the stove
Pluck that string, wiggle that bow
Midwest show, thunder and rain
Get to the East coast, turn around and head West again Move so fast (?) and you can't stay
A place in your heart You've come a long way
From the runny-nosed and scruffy kid I knew
You had such good ways
I can remember the little things
That always made you smile
They made you happy Now you think you're wiser because you're older
And you think that money buys everything
And you think you need no one to guide you
But you're still a long way from home
Yes, you're still a long way from home You've come a long way
You're self-assured and dressed in
Funny clothes but you don't know me
I hope that you find what you are looking for
With your car and your handmade overcoats But your wealth will never make you stronger
'Cause you're still a long way from home
Yes, you're still a long way from home
Yes, you are a long way from home Hey girl, let's begin again and try to help ourselves
We're like weary warriors who just came back from hell
You can keep your territory, I will stay in mine
Carefully negotiate and leave this battleground behind All we deserve is some peace in our time
Unconditional love is better, peace in our time And it really doesn't matter
'Cause the world keeps going round
Just like a roller coaster
If you let it, it will crush you down All we deserve is some peace in our time
I don't need no sympathy, just some peace of mind The two of us can't take it
Gotta have a truce so we can start
To pull it back together
Otherwise we're gonna fall apart I'm tearing up the bunch of angry letters that you sent
The living room's a wreck from all the rows
The atmosphere is stifled with aggression
Ultimatums, deadlines and depression Oh, we both deserve a better life
This friction's killing me
Don't want to be a Buddhist
But I need some peace and harmony and All that I ask is some peace in my time
A little bit of understanding peace in our time And I know that we can make it
But we got to compromise
Don't want no more division
So end this war and live our lives 'Cause all we deserve is peace in our time
Unconditional understanding peace in our time
I'm tearing up the bunch of angry letters that you sent
Peace in our time, peace in our time Now all the lies are beginning to show,
And you're not the country that I used to know.
I loved you once from my head to my toe,
But now my belief is shaken. And all your ways are so untrue,
No one breaks promises the way that you do.
You guided me, I trusted you,
But now my illusion's shaken. Thought this empire would be here
At least a thousand years.
But all the expectations and aspirations,
Slowly disappear. Now all the lies have gone on too long,
And a million apologies can't right the wrong.
Soldiers die but the lies go on,
But soon we will awaken. In our expectations for the future,
We were not to know.
We had expectations, now we've reached
As far as we can go. And all your manners are too, too polite,
Just to prove that your conscious is white and bright.
You had your day so get ready for the night,
For another dawn is breaking. We had expectations, now we've reached
As far as we can go. Here's my message from the road
I'm travelin' to a new time zone
So try to call again tomorrow Tell my kid I miss her so
Then I'll play in shows and singin' songs
But I miss the place where I belong
In another town, but still I find
That you are always on my mind
When night turns into day
There's another town so far away
Waiting for me on The Great Highway Right now you're in a far country
With good-time gals who come and go
You'll party with the good old boys
Have a drink and act macho
Out of sight and out of mind
Always somewhere on the road
Wherever you may go
You'll have a place in my heart
When night turns into day
In your reality, I'll be just another memory When the heat stops you sleeping at night
And the dead leaves rustle around
And the calmness keeps you awake
And you pace around the room That's the zombie in you manifesting itself
And you cry out loud and nobody can help
And it's a one way sign to the gates of hell
And there's no way back, no, there's no way back
Ain't no wonder you can't sleep at night You just heard the voodoo call
So you pace around, do the zombie crawl
And you shuffle around in the prison cell
Doing the voodoo walk, dancing with yourself
And you just can't blame the zombie inside of you Or the voodoo curse hanging over you
Or the zombie walk like an old soft shoe
Where the voodoo man's talking inside of you
Doing the voodoo walk, voodoo walk Ain't no evil spirits round here
Or zombie people or demons with pointy ears
Ain't no spooks waiting to appear Doing the voodoo walk
Talking the voodoo talk
Or the voodoo howl
Doing the voodoo walk, voodoo walk Voodoo walk, voodoo walk
Doing the voodoo walk, voodoo walk And the days are like living in hell
You're not well but you just did it to yourself You know the look
You can tell by that haunted stare
You're never quite here, you're never quite really there
And the cemetery's empty? cause the zombies are everywhere Doing the voodoo walk
Talking the voodoo talk
Or the voodoo howl
Doing the voodoo walk Doing the voodoo walk
Talking the voodoo talk
Or the voodoo growl
Doing the voodoo walk New England to Hollywood
Seems so far away
Like all roads lead us to California It's a long long way to paradise, isn't it?
In the neverending for all perfection
And it seems like an eternity
Since we first turned the ignition
And made our way down the highway
Because I told you lies
It seems a neverending lonesome drive And now the road is getting clear
The exit sign is very near
The empty spaces will lead us round
Hope we can find our new hometown
It's a long drive home to Tarzana
But once we're there we will see there's nothing there
Except that space
Beautiful space
We drove so far to find this place It's a long drive home to Tarzana
This space that community
All freeways to Tarzana
No more ghettos or urban strife
It's fine with me
It's fine with me It's a long long way to paradise, isn't it? Voices in the subway,
Looking for the overnight.
Echo in the darkness,
Lonely cries within a sound. A voice that has no face,
Is lost in time and inner space.
Chasing dreams that got lost in the dark.
Reaching out, always searching,
Lonely voices in the dark. (This is Surbiton, Surbiton. The train at Platform Two is for Wimblelton and
Waterloo only.) Lonely voices in the dark.
Lonely voices in the dark. A voice that has no face,
Is lost in time and inner space.
Chasing dreams that got lost in the dark.
Reaching out, always searching,
Lonely voices in the dark. Lonely voices in the dark.
Lonely voices in the dark. You're asking me, "what's it leading to?
Will we live a long life, will it treat us fair?"
No point asking me because I haven't got a clue You're asking me, "will it be alright?"
If you're asking me don't take my advice
And don't make me responsible
For you living your life I could say there will be laughter, you will never cry
I could just as easily go tell a lie, couldn't I, yeah
What would come after, that would be unwise
If that's what you really want
Then get a life, get a life, get a life You're asking me, "will it be alright?"
Because I've been around, I have the insight
And I was there the first time so I must know what it's like
If you're asking me, don't take my advice Do we learn from all the questions that we ask
Do we listen to the past, we never do
It's up to you to go and make your own mistakes
Have a go and break a leg
But please don't come home crying when you do You're asking me, don't take my advice
Because I've been there before
Doesn't come to pass
That I have all the answers to the questions that you ask
I'm telling you because you're asking me Anyway, what am I supposed to say
Could say everything is really brilliant
Anything to make your worries disappear
Put your conscience in the clear
And make you think there's nothing left to fear You're asking me, "what's it leading to?
Will we live a long life, will it treat us fair?"
No point asking me because I wasn't even there First time around it was really grand
But inside something said to me
Go get a life, get a life
Now that I'm here I can't understand
Why anyone is asking me, if I could give a damn
I could say there will be laughter, you will never cry
I could just as easily go tell a lie, couldn't I?
Then what would come after, that would be unwise
If that's what you really want then
Get a life, get a life, get a life
If you're asking me, don't take my advice Tell me what it's like in heaven
I hope it's kinder than it is down here
With all the trials and tribulations
All the worry and living in fear We are lost, we are scattered
We're balmy and we're battered
We might be bruised but we're not broken Hallelujah, hallelujah
I might be bruised but we're not broken And my heart (heart) is still beating
I'm alive (live) and I'm still breathing
I've got hope (hope) it's gonna get better
I might be bruised but I'm not broken
No The world moves in mysterious ways
And life happens day after day
We all struggle, feel so neglected
'Cause life's gonna hit you
When you least expect it to What's it like in heaven?
I hope it's kinder than it is down here
With all the trials and tribulations
We might be bruised but we're not broken We may never meet in the light of day
If we passed on the street, would we look the other way
So I search for you where we can't be seen
And I know we'll meet on the page of this magazine Two lonely hearts in an ocean of loneliness
Two lonely hearts in a shipwreck of pain
We call to each other as we drown in the city
O why
Do we have to remain
The outcasts in love and the losers in gain? It's a mean old town, can't show your heart
If you stand up and say what you mean they tear you apart
And they call it love, sell it by the pound
But the lovers are gone or they're living down underground Two lonely hearts in an ocean of loneliness
Two lonely hearts in a shipwreck of pain
Call to each other as we drown in the city
O why
Do we have to remain
The outcasts in love and the losers in gain? No-one needs a friend, no-one cares no more
They'll look hard at you but they won't take the chain off the door
O they work and slave, keep their conscience clean
They come home at night and they talk to an empty screen Two lonely hearts in an ocean of loneliness
Two lonely hearts in a shipwreck of pain
Call to each other as we drown in the city
O why
Do we have to remain
The outcasts in love and the losers in gain? Two lonely hearts, two lonely hearts
Two lonely hearts, two lonely hearts
Call to each other as we drown in the city
O why
Do we have to remain
The outcasts in love and the losers in gain?
The outcasts in love and the losers in gain? I'm so tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
So tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you I was a lonely soul
I had nobody till I met you
But you keeping me waiting
All of the time, what can I do? It's your life and you can do what you want
Do what you like
Please don't keep me waiting
Please don't keep me waiting 'Cause I'm so tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
I'm so tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you I was a lonely soul
I had nobody till I met you
But you keeping me waiting
All of the time, what can I do? It's your life and you can do what you want
Do what you like
Please don't keep me waiting
Please don't keep me waiting I'm so tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
I'm so tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you, for you, for you Baby, I feel good
From the moment I rise
Feel good from morning 'til the end of the day
'Til the end of the day You and me

From when we get up

We do as we please, yeah

'Til the end of the day
'Til the end of the day Looking for the working man's café
In the shopping center of the town
Looking for somewhere to fit in
In among the retail outlets Bought a pair of new designer pants
Where the fruit and veg man used to stand
I always used to see him there
Selling old apples and pears Chatting up the pretty girls
With knocked off goods in the van Don't you know he was a working man
Long ago he was a working man
And we sat in the working man's café
The working man's café Everything around me seems unreal
Everywhere I go it looks and feels like America
We've really come a long way down this road
Improving our surroundings as we go
Changing our roots and culture
But don't you know Long ago there was a working man
Don't you know we were all working men
And we'd sit and pass the time of day
At the working man's café I thought I knew you then but will I know you now?
There's gotta be a place for us to meet
I'll call you when I've found it
I only hope that life has made us a little more grounded
Hey man, I see you now. Oh oh, we were all working men
And here we are at the working man's café It's really good to see us come so far
But haven't we forgotten who we are
Taking out a larger loan
Equity relief and mortgages We all seem to pass the time of day
Online at the internet cafe
And if you forget my face
In case you've forgotten just who I am
I'm the kid with the greasy spoon
Firmly held in my hand Don't you know I was a working man
Long ago we were all working men
And we sat and spent the time of day
At the working man's café
Yeah, at the working man's café Here's wishing you the bluest sky,
And hoping something better comes tomorrow.
Hoping all thes rhyme,
And the very best of es to
Follow all the doubt and sadness.
I know that better things are on the way. Here's hoping all the days ahead
Won't be as bitter as the ones behind you.
Be an optimist instead,
And somehow happiness will find you.
Forget what happened yesterday,
I know that better things are on the way. It's really good to see you rocking out
And having fun,
Living like you just begun.
Accept your life and what it brings.
I hope tomorrow you'll find better things.
I know tomorrow you'll find better things. Here's wishing you the bluest sky,
And hoping something better comes tomorrow.
Hoping all thes rhyme,
And the very best of es to
Follow all the drudge and sadness.
I know that better things are on the way. I know you've got a lot of good things happening up ahead.
The past is gone it's all been said.
So here's to what the future brings,
I know tomorrow you'll find better things.
I know tomorrow you'll find better things. I had this dream America
Was always a very special place
Heroes of the great Wild West
Wild Bill Hickock and the rest
The romantic on a wreckless chase
'Til reality hit me in the face Hey, Hey, Hey
I'm ridin' on the Great Highway
All across America
From New York to L.A Hopin' I can find my dream
In New Hampshire or New Orleans
Find a place where I can stay
A'once I'm there I'm never goin' away so Hey, Hey, Hey
From Promenade to San Francisco Bay
All across America
Along the Great Highway Bright eyes like wishing wells
Instamatic kiss and tell
Optimistic self-belief
College girls with perfect teeth
Technicolor realism in 20/20 vision
Animated multi-race
And always out there in your face Hoorah, she'll be cool if you upset her
And life is not a road movie
So wake up to reality and Hey, Hey, Hey
I'm drivin' on the interstate
All across America
Along the Great Highway And even if the dream goes wrong
We'll stay for the last song So Hey, Hey, Hey
From Promenade to San Francisco Bay
All across America
We're on The Great Highway The great illusion it may be
But always somethin' else to see
Always some little hick town
To pick you up when you are down
Another day, another shake
Malted with a slice of cake
La di da di da di da (La di da di da di da) At a jukebox in a smoky bar
A girl stands looking at the stars
Dressed in denim, wearing shades
And how sad is the Great Highway (I had this dream, America) She sips her Coke, walks away
It's just a second in her day
But all her culture's on display
She might be a dreamer
But maybe I'm a dreamer too Hey, Hey, Hey
I'm ridin' on The Great Highway
All across America
From New York to LA Hey, Hey, Hey
Hey Can't believe what I just read
Gossip on the Internet
Now the tabloids have the news
Cross my heart it just ain't true
I never thought it of you Name names and every line
Is feeding their suspicious minds
I'm not bitter or angry
I'm only feeling sympathy
You really found the time To feed the reporter with your views
See the reporter break the news
Read the reporter, join the queue Spread the news, scandalize
Words cut like a thousand knives
Take the cash, bag the prize
For playing games with other people's lives See the reporter break the news
Read the reporter, join the queue Eat it up, take a bite
Feed the reader's appetite
They'll swallow anything you write
As long as it's in black and white
And full of titillation I can't believe what I just read
Excuse me, I just vomited
Tell your story, it's your call
So autobiographical
But oh, so trivial Feed the reporter They put it on the Internet
To help improve the circulation
They'll pepper it with lies
It's only other people's lives Feed the reporter
Read the reporter Politicians dressed in drag
Careers stopped with quick back stab
While anonymous informer flees
And leaves us with our fantasy
And erotic visions Who did what, when, to whom
In the dominatrix room?
Tabloids daily titillate
Each sordid tale reverberates
All across the nation (What can I say?)
Feed the reporter
(It's a vendetta)
Read the reporter A rumor then a vicious phrase
A poison pen can wreck your day
And weather(?) words that crucify
As tabloid judges sharpen up their knives Read the reporter
Black and white
See the reporter
Victimize
See a poor sucker
Crucified To stop the truth, so tell your lies
Betray your friends and get the prize
The dagger's in, now twist the knife
The gutter's full of other people's lives

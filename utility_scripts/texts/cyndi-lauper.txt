You with the sad eyes
don't be discouraged, though I realize it's hard to
take courage in a world, full of people
you can lose sight of it
And the darkness inside you
will make you feel so small
But I see your true colors, shining through
I see your true colors, and that's why I love you So don't be afraid, to let them show
your true colors, true colors
Are beautiful, like a rainbow
Show me a smile, don't be unhappy
I can't remember when I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy and
you've taken in all you can bare You call me up- because you know I'll be there But I see your true colors, shining through
I see your true colors, and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid, to let them show
Your true colors, true colors
Are beautiful, like a rainbow I can't remember when I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy and you take in all you can bare
You call me up- because you know I'll be there
And I see your true colors, shining through
I see your true colors and thats why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show Your true colors, true colors
True colors, are shining through
I see your true colors and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors, true colors
Are beautiful, like a rainbow Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind Suitcase of memories
Time after sometimes you picture me
I'm walkin' too far ahead
You're callin' to me, I can't hear what you've said Then you say, "go slow"
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen
From deep inside
The drum beats out of time If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time You said, "go slow"
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

All through the night
This precious time, when time is new Oh, all through the night today
Knowing that we feel the same without sayin' We have no past, we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start, the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends there is no end All through the night
Stray cat is crying so stray cat sings back
All through the night
They have forgotten what binding they lack Oh under those white street lamps
There is a little chance they may see We have no past, we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start, the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends there is no end Oh the sleep in your eyes is enough
Let me be there, let me stay there awhile We have no past, we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start, the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends there is no end
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends there is no end
(End)
(Oohoo ohooo ohooo)
(Oohoo ohooo ohooo)
(Oohoo ohooo ohooo) Come on in, and pull yourself up a chair (like Chairry !)
Let the fun begin, it's time to let down your hair!
Pee-wee's sure excited,
'Cause all his friends have been invited (that's you!)
To go wacky, at Pee-wee's Playhouse! There's a crazy rhythm, comin' from Puppetland (what's that?)
Dirty Dog, Cool Cat, Chicky Baby are the puppet band (yeah !)
He's got a couple of talkin' fish,
And a genie who'll grant a wish -
Golly, it's cuckoo at Pee-wee's Playhouse ! Globey's spinnin', Mr. Window's grinnin',
'cause Pterri's flyin' by (hello !)
The flowers are singin', the Picture Phone is ringin',
And the Dinosaur Family goes, "hi!"
Mr. Kite's soaring, Conky's still a snoring,
There's the flashing Magic Screen.
The Cowntess is so classy, Randy's kinda sassy -
A nuttier establishment you've never seen!
Spend the day with Pee-wee and you'll see what we mean! (come on !) Get outta bed, there'll be no more nappin'! (wake up!)
'Cause you've landed in a place where anything can happen -
Now we've given you fair warning!
It's gonna be that kind of morning -
For bein' wacky!
For getting nutty!
Golly, it's cuckoo!
At Pee-wee's Playhouse! I had to escape
The city was sticky and cruel
Maybe I should have called you first
But I was dying to get to you
I was dreaming while I drove
The long straight road ahead, uh, huh Could taste your sweet kisses
Your arms open wide
This fever for you is just burning me up inside I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright?
I drove all night
Crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep
To make love to you
Is that alright?
I drove all night What in this world
Keeps us from tearing apart
No matter where I go I hear
The beating of your heart
I think about you
When the night is cold and dark, uha, yeah
No one can move me
The way that you do
Nothing erases the feeling between me and you I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright?
I drove all night
Crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep
To make love to you
Is that alright?
I drove all night Could taste your sweet kisses
Your arms open wide
This fever for you is just burning me up inside I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright?
I drove all night
Crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep
To make love to you

Hanging onto strains of greed and blues
Break the chain then we break down

Unspoken expectations
Ideals you used to play with
They've finally taken shape for us. What's good enough for you
Is good enough for me
It's good enough
It's good enough for me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Now you'll say
You're startin' to feel the push and pull

Just like I said I would be
I'm your friend
Just like you think it should be
Did you think I would stand here and lie?
While our moment was passing us by
Oh, while I'm here Waiting for your change of heart
It just takes a beat
To turn it around
Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart
At the edge of my seat
Please turn it around Days go by
Leaving me with a hunger
I could fly
Back to when we were younger
When adventures like cars we would ride
And the years lied ahead still untried
While I stand here Waiting for your change of heart
It just takes a beat
To turn it around
Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart
At the edge of my seat
Please turn it around
Turn it around, around, around
Turn it around, around, around
Turn it around Blind leading blind
Never feel the laughter
Search through time
Nothing reveals the answer
If it's truth that you're looking to find
It is nowhere outside of your mind
While I bide my time Waiting for your change of heart
It just takes a beat
To turn it around
Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart
At the edge of my seat
Please turn it around Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart
It just takes a beat
To turn it around
Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart
At the edge of my seat
Please turn it around
Turn it around, around, around
Turn it around, around, around
Turn it around
And I'm waiting for your change of heart
Waiting for your change of heart The sex is in the heel
Even if you break it
The sex is in the feel
Honey you can't fake it
Jack it up cuz I'm not flat tire
Mack it up six inches higher
The sex is in the heel
So just embrace it
From London to Milan
Stilettos are an "ism"
In red and neon light
Gimme Jimmy choo choo choo choo choo choo shoes
In New York, Paris, Encore
Live it like an "ism"
Seduction at the thigh
The heel is the transmission
The sex is in the heel
Fierce as you can make it
The sex is the appeal
Kinky boys can shake it
Funk it up 'til it's ostentatious
Dress it up, it feels contagious
The sex is in the hell
So just embrace it
From London to Milan
Stilettos are an "ism"
In red and neon light
Gimme jimmy choo choo choo choo choo choo shoes
In New York, Paris, Encore
Live it live an "ism"
Seduction at the thigh
The heel is the transmission
Red's the color of panic, passion
Burgundy's the color of allergic reaction
It's not shlomo, it's manolo
La dolce vita at the go go
Kinky boots with lots of swagger
It's high-heeled heaven with a dagger
From London to Milan
Stilettos are an "ism"
In red and neon light
Gimme Jimmy choo choo choo choo choo choo shoes
In New York, Paris, Encore
Live it like an "ism"
Seduction at the thigh

Who will take the time to play
A mom who can be a friend and find a rainbow when it's gray
I want a mom to read me stories
And sing a lullaby

The sea of trouble, the land of pain
You're sending me where it always rains
Oh reconsider, I'm begging you, some hesitation
I'm holding on to my sanity
I feel the beginning of emergency
My hands are slipping, Oh please don't let me fall into This hole in my heart that goes all the way to China
You gotta fill it up with love before I fall inside of.
This empty hole in my heart that goes all the way to China
And though you can't see the bottom, believe me it's a long way down I'm on a planet without a plan
It's oh so lonely
I need to see you to get out of here
There's something deadly in this atmosphere
I'm in a desert, without a drink of your sweet water
You're my oasis in the burning sand
I'm out of danger when you touch my hand Throw me a lifeline, I'm standing oh the edge of .
A deep, dark hole that goes all the way to China
You gotta fill it up with love before I fall inside of ...
This empty hole in my heart that goes all the way to China
And though you can't see the bottom believe me it's a long way down A hole in my heart
Somebody cover it up
I've got this hole in my heart
You've got to fill it up with love Now the gun was loaded, I didn't know
I pulled the trigger,
I heard a noise - the room went dark
I felt the bullet going in my heart I feel so dizzy, oh please don't let me fall, don't leave me in This hole in my heart that goes all the way to China
You gotta fill it up with love before I fall inside of...
This empty hole in my heart that goes all the way to China
And though you can't see the bottom, it's a long way down I said, I'm sorry baby
I'm leaving you tonight
I found someone new
He's waitin' in the car outside Ah honey, how could you do it
We swore each other everlasting love
I said, well yeah, I know, but when we did
There was one thing we weren't thinking of and that's money Money changes everything
Money, money changes everything
We think we know what we're doing
That don't mean a thing
It's all in the past now
Money changes everything They shake your hand
And they smile and they buy you a drink
They say we'll be your friends
We'll stick with you till the end Ah, but everybody's only
Looking out for themselves
And you say, well who can you trust
I'll tell you it's just nobody else's money Money changes everything
I said money, money changes everything
You think we know what you're doing
We don't pull the strings
It's all in the past now
Money changes everything Yeah, yeah, yeah, money, money changes everything
I said money, money changes everything
We think we know what we're doing
We don't know a thing
It's all in the past now
Money changes everything Hey, yeah, yeah, money is everything, yes
Money changes everything, yeah
Money is everything
Money is everything, yes
Money changes everything, yeah, yeah Just when everything's in order and good
Things fall apart
Just when life should be resolving
I'm back at the beginning
And it comes back to the heart I'm not really sad
I'm not running, I'm looking
Did I tell you I've kept
All your letters and cards There's just nothing left for me
To do here but unhook the stars
There's just nothing left for me
To do here but unhook the stars Do you remember
When I told you
All that I could
And it seemed like too much I was living your life hoping you'd never fall
If I held on tight enough
And letting go now is like a passport to anywhere
With time on my hands I can make a new start I just didn't want to stay here
And unhook the stars
I just didn't want to stay here
And unhook the stars Don't worry for me it's just I'm inspired
Waiting in the wings
Made me drunk with possibility
It rivals my memories I didn't want to stay here
And unhook the stars
I just didn't want to stay here
And unhook the stars Everything's in order and good
Things fall apart
Just when life should be resolving
I'm back at the beginning
And it comes back to the heart I'm not really sad
I'm not running, I'm looking
Did I tell you I've kept
All your letters and cards There's just nothing left for me
To do here but unhook the stars
There's just nothing left for me
To do here but unhook the stars Didn't want to stay here
And unhook the stars
Didn't want to stay here
And unhook the stars
I didn't want to stay here
And unhook the stars I wanna fall into you
And I wanna be everything
You want me to
But I'm not sure I know how
I lose faith and I lose ground
Then I see you and remember
Unconditional love, love, love
Unconditional love It doesn't matter what I say
'Cause it always seems you're taking
Me the wrong way
But if you could read my mind you'd see
I fight myself all the time
When I see you I surrender
Unconditional love, love, love
Unconditional love, love Standing on a wilder shore
I got my head up in the clouds, oh
I ain't got no sense of direction now I wanna lie next to you
And I wanna do everything you want me to
Sometimes I wish at the sky
I imagine what the clouds look like
When I see you I remember Unconditional love, love, love
Unconditional love
When I see you I surrender
Unconditional love, love, love (2x)
When I see you I surrender...
Unconditional love... Oh the hills are full of spirits
And they walk when night comes round
And they speak to who they choose to
When the moon is shining down
And ramona loves the orchard
And liza loves the pine
And cyrus in the moonlight
Loves the flowing of the wine Oh cyrus trusts the spirits
And they fill his life with grace
Yeah the father of his fathers
Passed him down the gift of faith
And one night you might hear it
Like a wailing from above
It's just cyrus in the moonlight
Singing to the one he loves... And the two girls start to dancing
When they hear that drunken voice
That's when cyrus asks the moonlight
Do I have to make a choice
'tween liza with her red hair
And ramona with her blues
And with all these gifts they bring me
Tell me how can I refuse Well the hills are full of spirits
And they walk when night comes round
And they speak to who they choose to
When the moon is shining down
And ramona loves the orchard
And liza loves the pine
And cyrus in the moonlight
Loves the flowing of the wine
And one night you might hear it
Like a wailing from above
It's just cyrus in the moonlight
Singing to the one he loves... Shine I'll stand by you
Don't try and push me away
'cause I'm just gonna stay
You can shine I won't deny you
And don't be afraid it'll all be ok Do you know my name
Well I ain't gonna take
that big time line
won't be beat by a lie
Gonna call out to these embers
waiting to ignite
Gonna pull you up
By your love, by your love
and tell you Shine I'll stand by you
Don't try and push me away
'cause I'm just gonna stay
You can shine I won't deny you
And don't be afraid it'll all be ok I can see the frown you wear
All around like some faded crown
Like a watch over wound
Gonna call down to this diamond
buried underground
Gonna pull you up
by your love, by your love
and tell you - Shine I'll stand by you
Don't try and push me away
'cause I'm just gonna stay
You can shine I won't deny you
And don't be afraid it'll all be ok When it's said and done
What you need will come
and time won't let me
Let you let me waste it this time
shine... I've got a ticket, no turning back
My destination...
The sea of trouble, the land of pain
You're sending me where it always rains
Oh reconsider, I'm begging you, some hesitation
I'm holding on to my sanity
I feel the beginning of emergency
My hands are slipping, oh please don't let me fall into This hole in my heart that goes all the way to china
You gotta fill it up with love before I fall inside of...
This empty hole in my heart that goes all the way to china
And though you can't see the bottom, believe me it's a long way down I'm on a planet without a plan
It's oh so lonely
I need to see you to get out of here
There's something deadly in this atmosphere
I'm in a desert, without a drink of your sweet water
You're my oasis in the burning sand
I'm out of danger when you touch my hand 
Throw me a lifeline, I'm standing on the edge of... This deep, dark hole that goes all the way to china
You gotta fill it up with love before I fall inside of...
This empty hole in my heart that goes all the way to china
And though you can't see the bottom believe me it's a long way down The gun was loaded, I didn't know
I pulled the trigger,
I heard a noise then the room went dark
I felt the bullet going in my heart
I feel so dizzy, oh please don't let me fall, don't leave me in This hole in my heart that goes all the way to china
You gotta fill it up with love before I fall inside of -
This empty hole in my heart that goes all the way to china
And though you can't see the bottom, believe me it's a long way down I've got a hole in my heart
You've got to fill it up with love When you were mine
I gave you all of my money
Time after time
You've done me wrong Just like a train
Let all my friends come over and eat
You were so strange
You didn't have the decency to change the sheets Oh, when you were mine
Used to let you wear all o' my clothes
You were so fine
And baby that's the reason that it hurt me so I know, that you're goin' with another guy
I don't care, 'cause I love you baby that's no lie
I love you more than I did when you were mine When you were mine
You were kinda sorta my best friend
So I was blind
I let you fool around I never cared
I never was the kind to make a fuss
When he was there
Sleepin' in between the two of us I know, that you're goin' with another guy
I don't care, 'cause I love you baby that's no lie
I love you more than I did when you were mine When you were mine
You were all I ever wanted to do
Now I spend my time
Followin' him whenever he's with you I know that you're goin' with another guy
I don't care, 'cause I love you baby that's no lie
I love you more than I did when you were mine
Oh I love you more than I did when you were mine
Oh I love you more than I did when you were mine
Oh I love you more than I did when you were mine
Oh I love you more, I love you more, I love you more
I love you more Baby do you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong I seem bad Well I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood Baby sometimes I'm so carefree
with a joy that's hard to hide
Then sometimes again it seems that all I have is worry
And then you bound to see my other side But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood If I seem edgy
I want you to know
That I never meant to take it out on you
Life has its problems
and I have my share
And that's me one thing I never wanna do Baby
Don't you know I'm human
I have thoughts like any other one? Oh when sometimes I find myself alone regretting
Some little thing
Some simple thing I've done I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Please don't let me be misunderstood Where are you? You never knew yourself well enough, hah
But she never knew you at all
And when she put you out on your own
It may have stolen your innocence but not, no not your soul Tell me where is little boy blue, ho ho?
You'll find him standin' always one step ahead, oh
First a little shy, a little boy blue woh
Wise blood runs warm and deep
On the street, kids walkin', just a kid walkin', just a kid You send a letter with photographs, ahh
I'll tuck them under my dreams
And if we wake up old beyond our years
Not quite as brave as we seem, it's just the pain that never disappears Tell me where is little boy blue, ho ho?
You'll find him standin' always one step ahead, oh
First a little shy, a little boy blue, woh
Wise blood runs warms and deep
On the street, kids walkin', just a kid walkin', just a kid Who! Hey hey
Where are you? When she put you out on your own
It may have stolen your innocence but not, no not your soul
Tell me where is little boy blue, ho ho?
You'll find him standin' always one step ahead, oh
First a little shy, a little boy blue, woh woh
Wise blood runs warms and deep
On the street, kids walkin', just a kid walkin', just a kid walkin', just a kid Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you boy blue?
Hey, where are you?
You always find him one step ahead
You always find him one step ahead
Ahead
Where are you?
Where are you, boy blue? There's a place where the sun breaks through
And the wind bites cold and hard
Stings my ears and
Tears my eyes
When the day starts to shout out loud Stand tall
And glide
When you're all alone in the crowd
Don't fall
Don't hide
When you walk above the clouds
When you walk above the clouds When the light is against your face
And your smile is soft and sound
That's when you tell me all your fears
and all your dreams
So proud Stand tall
And glide 
When you're all alone in the crowd
Don't fall
Don't hide
When you walk above the clouds
When you walk above the clouds I try and tell you
to keep your head upright
Don't swing your sword and shield against the night
Don't block your blessings, boy
You don't have to fight
You don't have to fight Stand tall
And glide
When you're all alone in the crowd
Don't fall
Don't hide
When you walk above the clouds When you walk above the clouds I went down to the local gypsy
And I handed her the same line
You know what I want from you
So honey, won't ya gimme number nine? 'Cause you know lately I ain't feelin' so great
Last time she gave me love potion number eight
And you know pretty baby, how I think you're pretty smart
But one sip from this bottle and I'll tear you all apart The gypsy told me that the first thing
That would happen you get dizzy
Second thing you better make sure
That your boyfriend isn't busy 'Cause you don't wanna eat
And you won't wanna drink
You won't wanna talk
And you don't wanna think
My mother used to tell me not to kiss on the first date
This time when I see you, you know I ain't gonna wait I'll kiss you, gonna corner you and not let you go
I'll kiss you, don't tell me nothin', I don't wanna know
And twidely-dee and twidely-dum
I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you Hopped into a taxi and I told the driver
Got to get me cross town
Killed the bottle, started seeing double
When the driver turned around And though I was a failure with love potion number eight
Number nine was different and the hour's getting late
Now I'm standin' on the corner, everyone looks great to me
And if you come and get me take me where I want to be I'll kiss you, gonna corner you and not let you go
I'll kiss you, don't tell me nothin', I don't wanna know
And twidely-dee and twidely-dum
I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you 'Cause you know lately I ain't feelin' so great
Last time she gave me love potion number eight
And you know pretty baby, how I think you're pretty smart
But one sip from this bottle and I'll tear you all apart I'll kiss you, gonna corner you and not let you go
I'll kiss you, don't tell me nothin', I don't wanna know
And twidely-dee and twidely-dum
I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you Oh, you know lately I ain't feelin' so great
Last time she gave me love potion number eight
And you know pretty baby Oh, I don't wanna talk and I don't wanna think
I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you
Stop twidely--dee and twidely--dum, oh yeah
I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you
Oh, I don't wanna talk and I don't wanna think I was a failure with love potion number eight
But number nine was different and the hour's getting late
I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you Oh, I don't wanna talk and I don't wanna sleep
I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you Things like this can always take a little time
I always thought we'd be together down the line
We start to fight and can't get over, over what was said
'Cause you see black and white and I see red And I wonder who let in the rain
You know without you I'm not the same, no
Oh when love gets strong people get weak
Sometimes they lose control and wind up in too deep
They fall like rain, who let in the rain? Make the bed and cover where you used to sleep
I'm smoothing over promises made in these sheets
Envy lovers passing by out on the street, oh
'Cause what they have I couldn't keep And I wonder who let in the rain
You know without you I'm not the same, no
Oh when love gets strong people get weak
Sometimes they lose control and wind up in too deep
They fall like rain, who let in the rain? Who let in the rain? And I wonder who let in the rain
You know without you I'm not the same, no
Oh when love gets strong people get weak
Sometimes they lose control and wind up in too deep
They fall like rain, who let in the rain? Who let in the rain?
Who let in this rain? Who let in the rain? Let in, who let in the rain?
Who let in this rain? Who let in the rain?
Who let in the, who let in the, who let in the
Who let in, who let in, who let in the rain?
Who let in the rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain? Shattered dreams of days gone by
Makes me want to sit right down and cry
All the plans I had and what it turned to
Just shattered dreams Yesterday was long ago
When I first met you, you were my dream
All in vain, and it only brought me pain
Yes, and shattered dreams Your goodbye shattered it all
For early this morning, blues brought me a call
Now all I had is gone, and all that's left
Is my shattered dreams Shattered dreams Shattered dreams, baby Shattered dreams
Shattered dreams
Shattered dreams Shattered dreams
My shattered dreams 
 My heart keeps beating me to death
I see you move and I can't catch my breath
I want to touch you with my lips
I want to touch you with a kiss My heart keeps pounding like a fist
I see you there and I just can't resist
You make me tremble like a jellyfish It's primitiva
You got me
Oh
It's primitive
You make me feel
Primitive
When you lock me in your arms
You chain me to your heart ... Oh I hear you calling out my name
And when you talk your words they numb my brain
You make this fire in me start
I want to touch you with my heart I hear you whisper in the dark
And when you touch me I just come apart
I feel the fever in your hands
We feel things we don't even understand It's primitive
You got me ... Oh
It's primitive
You make me feel
Primitive
When you lock me in your arms
You chain me to your heart ... Oh
It's animal Like the moon pulls at the tide
I'm at your side
The world in which we live Is primitive
You got me ... Oh
It's primitive You make me real
Primitive
When you lock me in your arms
You chain me to your heart ... Oh You don't know where you belong
You should be more careful
As you follow blindly along
You just need to belong somehow Relying on rhetoric
Not well versed on topics
Any idea what you're talking about?
Revisions of history
Fair well in some company
But don't shove that bullshit down my throat You don't know where you belong
You should be more careful
As you follow blindly along
To find something to swear to
Till you don't know what's right from wrong
You just need to belong somehow Left suppresses right
Right suppresses left
So what's the left, and what's right?
You're told what to wear
You're told what to like
I'd be nice if you'd think for yourself sometime
But you don't Now you don't know where you belong
You should be more careful
As you follow blindly along
To find something to swear to
Till you don't know what's right from wrong
You just need to belong somehow
You just need to belong somehow Mix sheer hypocrisy with mediocrity
You'll play it safe every time
So life turns up empty
And you're so dissatisfied
Who are you blaming blaming this time this time?
Don't you know? Now you don't know where you belong
You should be more careful
As you follow blindly along
To find something to swear to
Till you don't know what's right from wrong
You just need to belong somehow
You just need to belong somehow You don't, you don't know where
You don't know where you belong
You don't know where you belong
You don't know where you belong My baby don't care for shows
My baby don't care for clothes
My baby just cares for me
My baby don't care for cars and races
My baby don't care for high-tone places Brad Pitt is not his style
And even Jennifer Aniston's smile
Is somethin' he can't see
My baby don't care who knows
My baby just cares for me Baby, my baby don't care for shows
And he don't even care for clothes
He cares for me
My baby don't care
For cars and races
My baby don't care for
He don't care for high-tone places Georege Clooney is not his style
And even Queen Latifah's smile
Is something he can't see
Is something he can't see
I wonder what's wrong with baby
My baby just cares for
My baby just cares for
My baby just cares for me At last
my love has come along
my lonely days over
and life is like a song Ooh At last
the skies above are blue
well my heart was wrapped up in clover
the night I looked at you I found a dream
that I could speak to
a dream that I could call my own
I found a thrill
to press my cheek to
a thrill that I have never known You smile
you smile
oh and then the spell was cast
and here we are in heaven
for you are mine at last I found a dream
that I could speak to
a dream that I
could call my own
I found a thrill
to press my cheek to
a thrill that I have never known You smile
you smile
oh and then the spell was cast
and here we are in heaven
for you are mine at last ooo yea
you are mine
you are mine
at last
at last
at last
at last I bought no gift this year
And I slept with your sister
I know I should have thought twice
Before I kissed her
But with the year we had last
And the dress that she wore
I just went along for the ride
And I came back for more
And I'm sorry baby That's all ok hunny cause see...
I bought no tree this year
And I slept with your brother
I wrecked your daddies car
And went down on your mother
I set your record collection on fire
And said I never knew
Felt kind of bad about that
And I know you did too So whatever you say, it's all fine by me
Who the fuck anyway wants a christmas tree
'Cos the snow keeps on falling even though we were bad
It'll cover the filth, we should both just be glad
And spend spend spend this chris-christmas together I married you last year
Bet you thought I was sober, right?
But I was drunk as a skunk and I made a mistake
This could all have been over
Oh hunny please don't
Excuse your behavior
Cause I hired a hit man and changed your will
It's now all in my favour So whatever you say, it's all fine by me
Who the fuck anyway wants a christmas tree
'Cos the snow keeps on falling even though we were bad
It'll cover the filth, we should both just be glad
And spend spend spend this chris-christmas together
And spend spend spend this chris-christmas together
And spend spend spend this chris-christmas together
And spend spend spend this chris-christmas together
Holding on without any reason
Cause something's strong this holiday season So whatever you say, it's all fine by me
And who the fuck anyway wants a christmas tree
'Cos the snow keeps on falling even though we were bad
It'll cover the filth, we should both just be glad
And spend spend spend this chris-christmas together
And spend spend spend this chris-christmas together
And spend spend spend this chris-christmas together
And spend spend spend this chris-christmas together Gather 'round children and you will hear
The sound of a cricket crying in your ear
That's mother nature, she's crying out loud
This old earth needs some loving now, so Chorus:
Put on your green shoes
Put on your green shoes
Mother nature, she's calling to you
To put on your green shoes Put on your green shoes and walk with me
We'll go around back and plant a tree
Help it grow and you will see
The way the world was meant to be Chorus Wonder how the world would be
Without the shade of a redwood tree
Without all the fish, the birds and the bees
Springtime would be lonely, so Chorus Holding on to the rhythm
I'm standing in my leather and lace
People move to the left, and
Move to the right, and
The whole place starts to shake Without a net on a real high wire
I'm stepping out with my heels on fire I started dancing with a stranger
Moving to the break of day
Dancing with a stranger
And I just got swept away Letting go my inhibitions
Is harder to do than say
But I surrender to the beat
I start shuffling my feet
When I hear that music play I trip the light fantastic
I touch the sky and it feels like magic I started dancing with a stranger
Moving to the break of day
Dancing with a stranger
And I just got swept away Give me a dance, dance
Dancing with a stranger
And it takes my breath away I ain't looking for mister right
It doesn't matter to me
There's something in the air
Electric I like
Igniting endlessly I started to dance... Without a net on a real high wire
I'm stepping out with my heels on fire I started dancing with a stranger
Moving to the break of day
Dancing with a stranger
And I just got swept away... I can see
You're slipping away from me
And you're so afraid
That I'll plead with you to stay
But I'm gonna be strong
I'll let you go your way Love is gone
There's no sense in holding on
And your pity now
Would be more than I could bare
So I'm gonna be strong
I'll pretend I don't care I'm gonna be strong
And stand as tall as I can
I'm gonna be strong
And let you go along
And take it like a man When you say it's the end
I'll hand you a line
I'll smile and say
Don't you worry it's fine
But you'll never know darling
After you kiss me goodbye
How I'll break down and cry. Cry . . .
Cry . . .
Cry . . . Felt someone calling me into the howling of the wind
I heard the reflection of a sound echoing through my skin
And a distant drum rumbling under ground gently guides me on
Through my wild heart whispering to me The sisters of Avalon
Sisters of Avalon
Sisters of Avalon
Sisters of Avalon She is awakening in dark swells and mystery
Unbridled nightmares powerful and running free
You could still hear her cries reverberating through the trees
For the trampled flowers, the daughters of Eve The sisters of Avalon
Sisters of Avalon
Sisters of Avalon
Sisters of Avalon They brought her in, in a new white dress
But the stain left an ache on her mother's breast
Now all that's left are the ghostly steps
From a distant corridor And a distant drum rumbling under ground
Gently guides me on through my wild heart
Whispering to me, to me, to me The sisters of Avalon
Sisters of Avalon
Sisters of Avalon
Sisters of Avalon The sisters of Avalon
The sisters of Avalon
The sisters of Avalon
The sisters come on, sisters come on, sisters You're sorry now
And you'll change somehow
And I am what you need to get out I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a witness No, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a witness 'Cause I'm crawling back

I don't wanna be a witness No, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a witness

And fly all over this world I don't care how great you are
I don't care what you're worth
When it all comes up
You've got to go back to Mother Earth You may play the racehorses
You may own a racetrack
You may have enough money, baby,
To buy anything you like I don't care how great you are
I don't care what you're worth
When it all goes up
You've got to go back to Mother Earth You may play the racehorses
You may own your own track
You may have enough money
To buy anything you like I don't care how great you are
No, I don't care what you're worth
When it all comes up
You've got to go back to Mother Earth  How long will I last
Standing out here on my own
I wonder, did I move too fast
You know I hate slow dancing alone I keep leading with my heart
You keep saying
That we're worlds apart
That our love is so taboo These empty arms
Won't last too long
Hope you appreciate
I need your unabbreviated love
and I'll stick like glue
Can I anticipate
I need your unabbreviated love Now, that's how I feel
I'm gonna be your lucky star
If you stop spinning your wheels
And sending out these false alarms Why must love feel like a heart attack
You held me once and
You keep coming back
Oh boy you haven't got a clue Oh these empty arms
Won't last too long
Hope you appreciate
I need your unabbreviated love
and I'll stick like glue
Can I anticipate
I need your unabbreviated ... Love is unavoidable
Love can put you back on track
As a matter of fact
Love makes you forget your troubles
A love like that
You don't throw back, no, no I keep leading with my heart
You keep saying
That we're worlds apart
That our love is so taboo These empty arms
Won't last too long
Hope you appreciate
I need your unabbreviated love
and I'll stick like glue
Can I anticipate
I need your unabbreviated love Need ya yeah
I wanna hold ya
I wanna kiss ya
I need your unabbreviated love I wanna hold ya
I wanna squeeze ya yeah
I need your unabbreviated love Hold me close and hold me fast
The magic spell you cast
This is la vie en rose When you kiss me heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see La vie en rose When you press me to your heart
I'm in a world apart
A world where roses bloom
And when you speak, angels sing from above
Everyday words seem to turn into love songs
Give your heart and soul to me
And life will always be La vie en rose Ding Dong! Merrily on high
In heaven the bells are ringing;
Ding Dong! Verily the sky
Is riv'n with angels singing: Gloria, Hosanna in Excelsis
Gloria, Hosanna in Excelsis E'en so here below, below,
Let steeple bells be swungen,
And I-O, I-O, I-O,
By priest and people sungen, Gloria, Hosanna in Excelsis
Gloria, Hosanna in Excelsis Pray you, dutifully prime
Your matin chime, ye ringers:
May you beautifully rhyme
Your evetime song, ye singers. Gloria, Hosanna in Excelsis
Gloria, Hosanna in Excelsis I saw you gather all your hope with all your dreams
I waved just like a shooting star that once I waved to me
I am a lover in mid-air
I think it about it; I don't care
Into the fire of despair
Just like a train that goes nowhere But you can rain on me
Yeah you can rain rain on me There was a time I got it wrong
It shakes my memory
And all the time I had it all
Its just I couldn't see
I am a robber in the dark
Singing about a broken heart
Answering whistles in the air
Waiting for someone else to care But you can rain on me
Yeah you can rain on me
Yeah you can rain on me
Yeah you can rain on me When the rain came tumbling down
And both your feet were on the ground oh
Running fast and free oh yeah
Well maybe time gonna wear you out
or maybe you're gonna come around or
we'll just wait and see oh yeah But you can rain on me
Yeah you can rain on me
But you can rain on me
Yeah you can rain rain on me Yeah you can rain on me
But you can rain... If you go away
On this summer's day
Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in the summer sky
When our love was new
And our hearts were high
And the day was young
And the nights were long
The trees stood still for the night birds song If you go away
If you go away
If you go away And if you stay
I'll make you a day
Like no day has been
Or will be again
I'll sail on the sun
I'll ride on the rain
I'll talk to the trees
And I'll worship the wind
But if you go
I'll understand
Leave me just enough love
To fill up my hand If you go away
If you go away
If you go away If you go away
As I know you will
You must tell the world to stop turning, turning
Til you return again
If you ever do
For what good is love
Without loving you
Let me tell you now
As you turn to go
I'll be dying slowly
Til your next hello If you go away
If you go away
If you go away But if you stay,
I'll make you a night
Like no night has been
Or will be again
I'll sail on you smile
I'll ride on your touch
Oh, I'll talk to your eyes
How I love them so much
But if you go
I won't cry
For the good is gone
In the word "goodbye" If you go away
Please don't go away
Please don't go away Please don't leave me
I won't cry anymore
I won't talk anymore
I'll hide in your room
And I'll watch you
As you dance and you smile
And I'll listen a while
As you sing and you laugh
Please let me become
The shadow of your shadow
The shadow of your hand
The shadow of your glass
On this shadow of a man Please don't leave me
Please stay
Please don't go away And if you stay
I'll make you a day
Like no day has been
Or will be again
I'll sail on the sun
I'll ride on the rain

Leave me just enough love
To fill up my hand If you go away

And you can't think what it is
If you feel a quiet longing
Lift your heart into the wind
There you'll find my kindred spirit
There you'll meet me as a friend
It is just a kindred feeling
And a song to let you in... Well, you hear about all these women
Raising about their funky, funky, funky, funky men
They've got some trifling husbands
Lord knows, they've got a lot of no good friends All these fretting women sitting around the house
All day long and they are wondering
When their loving papas are ever coming home
Wild women never worry, wild women never, never, they never worry I got a sweet disposition, gonna wear my very own
I ain't never gonna spend not one lonely night at home all alone
I can go out, drink all the courvoisier I can find
Walk the streets all night alone And I can tell any man to go to Hell if that man don't
know how to act right
Wild women, we don't never worry, wild women never, never get the blues Well, you fellas ain't ever gonna get nothing
If you keep acting like an Angel, child
Give it up tonight's a real, real good night
Y'all gotta learn how to get to together well 'Cuz I'll tell you one more thing, Francine never tells a lie
Wild women will be the first ones, Lord to learn how to fly
Wild women never worry, wild women don't get the blues, yeah, yeah, yeah stone the world is stone
it's no trick of the light
it's hard on the soul stone the world is stone
cold to the touch
and hard on the soul
in the grey of the streets
in the neon unknown
i look for a sign
that im not on my own
that im not here alone as the still of the night
and the choke of the air
and the winners delight
and the losers despair
closes in left and right
i would love not ot care stone, the world is stone
from the far away look
without stars in my eyes
throught the halls of the rich
and the flats of the poor
wherever i go
theres no warmth anymore
theres no love anymore so i turn on my heels
im declining the fall
ive had all i can take
with my back to the wall
tell the world im not in
im not taking the call stone the world is stone
but i saw it once
with the stars in my eyes
when each colour rang out
in a thunderous chrome
its no trick of the light
i cant find my way home
in a world made of stone Long ago a lonely man stood
Off of a quiet avenue
A pretty girl in passing chanced to look
That's when he fell, fell for you
I listen to the rain
Pounding on the railing
The beat's a sweet, soft refrain
of how he found you LORRAINE
He's rocking on a porch you used to know
Here where he swore his love was true
He sips his drink and dreams the days of old
Of when he fell, fell for you
I listen to the rain... The train was leaving at 10 after 10
I got to the station just in time to check in
I've been bumpin' my bags all around
I'm trying hard to never knock people down
But I can see I left a few on the ground
And as the train pulls away I can hear the conductor say Right track wrong train (echoes)
Right track wrong train (echoes)
I'm not to blame (echo)
Right track wrong train... train I read my schedule but my train wasn't there
I re-read my ticket, it said going nowhere
Everybody had the same tatooed face
All the women and men dressed in lace
I think I gotta get out of this place
I should've got off before the engineer locked the door Right track wrong train (echoes)
Right track wrong train (echoes)
I'm not to blame (echo)
Right track wrong train, train train train hey! "Hey that's a neat tatoo you're wearing. By the way where'd you get it?
Uh huh. Say, is this an express train? Uh huh.
Snack bar? Uh huh. Uh huh." Something is happening so familiar to me
Is this the outer limits like on TV?
Another empty town fading to gray
Another Coca-Cola sign on the way
Have a cup of coffee, have a nice day
And as the train pushes on,
We're headed for Babylon
Oh no... Right track wrong train (echoes)
Right track wrong train (echoes)
Right track wrong train...
On the wrong train on the right track
We don't know if she'll ever come back (Talking) What train is this?
Something is happening so familiar to me
Is this the outer limits like on TV?
Have a cup of coffee, have a nice day (talking)
"Yeah, yeah I'll be right there yeah.
I'm gonna get the next train yeah." The wind is in from Africa
Last night I couldn't sleep
You know it's really hard to leave here
But it's really not my home My fingernails are filthy
I got beach tar on my feet
Oh, you know I miss my clean white linen and my fancy French cologne Carey, get out your cane
And I'll put on my silver
Oh, you're a mean old daddy, but I like you Come on down to the Mermaid Cafe
I will buy you a bottle of wine
And we'll laugh and toast to nothing
And smash our empty glasses down
Let's have a round for these freaks and these soldiers
Let's have a round for these friends of mine
Let's have a round for the bright red devil
Who keeps me in this tourist town Come on, Carey, get out your cane
And I'll put on my silver
Oh, you're a mean old daddy, but I like you
I like you, I like you, I like you And I'll go to Amsterdam
Or maybe I'll go down to Rome
And I'll rent me a grand piano and put flowers in my room
Oh but let's not talk of fare-thee-wells,
Because tonight is a starry dome
And they're playing that scratchy rock 'n' roll
Beneath, beneath, beneath the matalla moon Oh, Carey, get out your cane
And I'll put on my silver
Oh, you're a mean old daddy, but I like you
Oh, you're a mean old daddy, but I like you,
I like you, I like you The wind is in from Africa
Last night I couldn't sleep
You know it sure is hard to leave here
But it's really not my home My fingernails are filthy
I got beach tar on my feet
And I miss my clean white linen and my fancy French cologne Oh, Carey get your cane
And I'll put on my silver
Oh you're a mean old daddy, but I like you I said, come down to the Mermaid Cafe, have fun tonight
Oh, you're a mean old daddy but I like you... Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying
And brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know you've got to find a way
To bring back love here today Father, father
There's no need to escalate
You see, war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
To bring back lovin' here today Picket lines (brother)

So you can see
Hey, what's going on

And dream a while my little son and moon
May the stars be your crown
And may the earth guide you round and round Snuggle up and let me hold kiss
Your baby breath in the dark and cold
On a silent night long ago
Another mother held her babe and told him Close your eyes December Child
And dream a while my little son and moon
May the stars be your crown
And may the earth guide you round and round They had come such a long long way
Rest your little head on me and I'll tell you of
A little king and his bed of hay
It is remembered every Christmas day Little one, little son
All my life I've wished you welcome Close your eyes December Child
And dream a while my little son and moon
May the stars be your crown
And may the earth guide you round and round Every time I hear that march from Lohengrin
I am always on the outside lookin' in
Maybe, that is why I see the funny side
When I see somebody's brother take a bride Weddings make a lot of people sad
But if you're not the one, they're not so bad Another bride, another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopee A lot of shoes, a lot of rice
The groom is nervous
Who can blame him? He answers twice
It's really killin', but he's so willin' to make whoopee Picture a little love nest, I got you
Down where the roses cling, it's very romantic
Picture that same sweet love nest
Think, what a year can bring, I'm with you He's washing dishes and baby clothes, he should
He's so ambitious, not really, he even sews, 2003 babe
But don't forget folks, that's what you get folks
For makin' whoopee Another year, what, or maybe less
What's this I hear, can't you guess? No
She feels neglected and he's suspected, that's right
Of makin' whoopee She sits alone 'most every night
He doesn't phone nor even write, I forgot the number
He says, he's busy, yeah but she says, is he?
He's makin' whoopee He doesn't make much money
Yeah, five hundred thousand per, who told ya that?
Some judge who thinks he's funny
Says, you pay six to her He says, "Now judge, what if I fail?"
Judge says, "Bud, right into jail" Whoops
You better keep her, I think it's cheaper
Than makin' whoopee Yeah, don't forget, folks
That's what you get, folks
For makin' whoopee Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we sing along
Walking in a winter wonderland In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
We'll face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the alligators knock him down When it snows, ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play
The Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland Yeah, yeah, yeah Walking in a winter wonderland Yeah, yeah, yeah Walking in a winter wonderland Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worries on the doorstep
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street Can't you hear the pitter-pat
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be complete
On the sunny side of the street I used to walk in the shade with my blues on parade
But I'm not afraid... this rover's crossed over If I never had a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street I used to walk in the shade with them blues on parade
Now I'm not afraid... this rover has crossed over
Now if I never made one cent
I'll still be rich as Rockefeller
There will be goldust at my feet

You may wonder what I'm here to sell
But underneath my stare, I'm so naked there
There are secrets I'm dying to tell It's hard to be me
Nobody knows what it's like to be
The envy of mediocrity If you could see
All my depth and complexity
I'd think you'd agree
It's hard to be me It's hard to be me I am up here alone, on my glamorous throne
Want to thank all you people down there
I was once an unknown, like you but I've grown
I have so much I'm hoping to share It's hard to be me
Nobody knows what it's like to be
The envy of mediocrity If you could see
All my depth and complexity
I'd think you'd agree
It's hard to be me
It's hard to be me I guess you think that it's hard for you
Walking 'round in your little shoes
You don't know how I've sacrificed
To live this life, to look so nice It's hard to be me
Nobody knows what it's like to be
The envy of mediocrity If you could see
All my depth and complexity
I'd think you'd agree
It's hard to be me
It's hard to be me Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me It's time to make the Christmas punch
Let's hang the streamers from the ceiling
Bring out the old cheer, ring in the New Year
And get that Christmas feeling I wish you joy that never ends, happy times with all your friends
Come on and hold my hips a little longer, as we do the Christmas conga
Bonga, bonga, bonga, do the Christmas conga
Bonga, bonga, bonga, do the Christmas conga The old white tree still looks good
And grandma's angels got me thinking
String up the new lights, brighten the cold nights
And get those baubles blinking I wish you joy that never ends, happy times with all your friends
Come on and hold my hips a little longer, as we do the Christmas conga
Bonga, bonga, bonga, do the Christmas conga
Bonga, bonga, bonga, do the Christmas conga I'd like to take this opportunity to wish you all
A very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
And by the way, have a nice life Then we'll put on party hats
As the year comes to a conclusion
Turn on the yule log, spike up the egg nog
And break those resolutions I wish you joy that never ends, happy times with all your friends
Come on and hold my hips a little longer, as we do the Christmas conga
Bonga, bonga, bonga, do the Christmas conga
Bonga, bonga, bonga, do the Christmas conga I wish you joy that never ends, happy times with all your friends
Come on and hold my hips a little longer, as we do the Christmas conga
Bonga, bonga, bonga, do the Christmas conga
Bonga, bonga, bonga, do the Christmas conga As soon as you're born they make you feel small
By giving you no time instead of it all
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
They hate you if your clever and they despise a fool
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't fallow their rules
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be When they've tortured and scared you for 20 odd years
Then they expect you to pick a career
When you can't really function you're so full of fear
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be Keep you doped wit religion and sex and tv
And you think you're so clever and classless and free
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be There's room at the top they are telling you still
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill
If you want to be like the folks on the hill
A working class hero is something to be
If you want to be a hero just follow me
If you want to be a hero well just follow me Look out of any window
Any morning, any evening, any day
Maybe the sun is shining
Birds are winging or
Rain is falling from a heavy sky -
What do you want me to do,
To do for you to see you through?
This is all a dream we dreamed
One afternoon long ago Walk out of any doorway
Feel your way, feel your way
Like the day before
Maybe you'll find direction
Around some corner
Where it's been waiting to meet you -
What do you want me to do,
To watch for you while you're sleeping?
Well please don't be surprised
When you find me dreaming too Look into any eyes
You find by you, you can see
Clear through to another day
I know it's been seen before
Through other eyes on other days
While going home --
What do you want me to do,
To do for you to see you through?
It's all a dream we dreamed
One afternoon long ago Walk into splintered sunlight
Inch your way through dead dreams
To another land
Maybe you're tired and broken
Your tongue is twisted
With words half spoken
And thoughts unclear
What do you want me to do
To do for you to see you through
A a box of rain will ease the pain
And love will see you through Just a box of rain -
Wind and water -
Believe it if you need it,
If you don't just pass it on
Sun and shower -
Wind and rain -
In and out the window
Like a moth before a flame It's just a box of rain
I don't know who put it there
Believe it if you need it
Or leave it if you dare
But it's just a box of rain
Or a ribbon for your hair
Such a long long time to be gone
And a short time to be there I know you expected me
To act just like a schoolgirl
Followed your rules
Just like a fool
Wrapped up in your world
What's good for you
Don't mean that's so good for me
What can I do, but hang around
And lose myself just like I used to
Go round and round just like a loose screw Well I ain't gonna walk
With my heart in my hand
And take things lying down like before
Won't take your crap the way I used to
Ain't gonna be the way it used to,
Alright for you, ain't alright for me Maybe I was weak though the average
Person probably thinks I'm stronger
When I need someone else
I shut out myself,
Scared to say the wrong words
What's right for you
Don't think that's alright for me
You spread the glue, so I can't move
And stick to you just like I used to
Go round and round just like a loose screw... Oh I ain't gonna walk
With my heart in my hand...
...Ain't gonna do it like I used to
Go round and round just like a loose screw
Alright for you ain't alright for me, no
Everytime you pust me down
Everytime you screw me around
Everytime you do that to me
I'm my own possession
I'm my own possession... Don't close your eyes
Or I might drift away
Under the night
My image bends its shape
I'll be written on the wind
Like they never set a street (or Liking never settle streams)
Heading for the moon I reach out (echoes)
My pulse begins to race (echoes)
The crashing sounds
Of fears I've never faced
Let them echo off these waves
With thoughts as brave as they once were
Heading for the moon And, look
How we write
Over the white
Shadows may chase from behind
But just put them out of your mind, oh
Heading for the moon Don't close your eyes
Or I might drift away
Under the night
Of never ending shapes
I'll be wishing off the blue
I'll still wanna send my stars
Heading for the moon And, look
How we write
Over the white
Shadows may chase from behind
But just put them out of your mind, oh
Heading for the moon Ha ha
Heading for the Moon
So don't close your eyes
Heading for the Moon
Over the white Your shadows may chase from behind
You might just put them out of your mind
Heading for the Moon With every step I take I get one step in step with you
With every move you make I can't wait to make my move
Got your voice buzzing in my head and a rollercoaster down my spine
Well don't you know that boys will be boys
And I could never live my life without you
Sometimes you make me feel like I got a heartful of toys
Oh baby boys will be boys. Tell me what can I do 'cause I can't change the things I said
I can't help the way I feel or what goes on inside my head
Bad news and broken dreams in time will fade away
Well don't you know that boys will be boys
But baby I'm a man since the day I found you.
Sometimes you make me feel like I got a heartful of toys
Oh baby boys will be boys. And don't you know that girls will be girls
And I just wanna live any way that I want to
From either side of the fence vive la difference
So help me boys will be boys
Got your voice buzzing in my head and a rollercoaster down my spine
Well don't you know that boys will be boys...
Boys will... boys will be... boys will be boys...

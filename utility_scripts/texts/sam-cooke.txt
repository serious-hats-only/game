She had been sick,
Sick so very long
But she heard 'bout Jesus was passin' by
So she joined the gathering throng
And while she was pushing her way through
Someone asked her "what are you trying to do?"
She said "if I could just touch the hem of his garment I know I'll be made whole" She cried "Oh Lord" (Oh Lord)
And "Oh Lord" (Oh Lord)
"Oh Lord Oh Lord" (Oh Lord)
And "Oh Lord" (Oh Lord)
Said "If I could just touch the hem of his garment I know I'll be made whole" And whoa, she spent her money
Here and there
Until she had no,
Had no more to spare
The doctors, they done all they could
But their medicine would do no good
When she touched him, the savior didn't see
But still he turned around and cried "somebody touched me"
She said "it was I who just wanna touch the hem of your garment
I know I'll be made whole right now" She stood there cryin' "Oh Lord" (Oh Lord)
"Oh Lord" and "Oh Lord" (Oh Lord)
"Oh Lord" (Oh Lord)
And "Oh Lord" (Oh Lord)
Said "if I could just touch the hem of your garment
I know I'll be made whole right now" (Hooh aah) (hooh aah)

Working on the highways and byways
And wearing, wearing a frown

That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang Can't ya hear them singin'

Who did her wonders tell
Every time she'd doubt him,
She'd start to think about him
The man who gave her water, lord
And it was not in the well
Yes, he gave her water
Jesus gave her water
Jesus gave her water
Oh, let his praises swell
I tell you he gave that woman water
He gave her that lovin, lastin water

But Frankie could see that he was doing a wrong And oh let me tell you, Frankie reached down in her pocketbook
And up with a long 44, she shot once, twice, three times
And Johnny fell on the hardwood floor

Tell me, did they really pierce Him in the side that morn
O Lord, he said if you were there
I wonder did they pierce the Savior in the side? Sometimes it causes me to tremble
Every time I think about how they did the Lord
It makes me tremble 'cause I was there
And they really pierced him in the side that morning A fellow said, I want you to tell me if you were there?
If you were there kindly tell me
Did he hang there and never say one word? Sometimes I have to tremble

When a boy is in love
And the world to him is a beautiful place
When a boy is in love
He's up and he's gone
There's no breakfast for him
Cause he lives on the love of his sweet little gem
The days not through, though it's not very long
Before he must talk to his girl on the phone
That's how it is when a boy falls in love His girl's voice on the phone brings him wondrous delight
When a boy is in love
If there's been any darkness, it all fades from sight
When a boys in love
He can hardly wait til the moment they meet
For he knows when he sees her his day will be complete
When they're finally alone and he kisses her lips
The world sings a love song and his heart turns a flip
That's how it is when a boy falls in love At the end of the day the time comes they must part
The strings of regret tear away at his heart
And late in the night as he sleeps on his bed
Visions of her sweet song, how they dance in his head
And before you know he is buying a ring
To capture forever that sweet darling thing
That's how it is when a boy falls in love
That's how it is when a boy falls in love Feel it
Feel it
Feel it
Feel it Baby when the band is playin'
And that solid beat
Make you wanna move, make you wanna groove
Make you wanna pat your feet
Don't fight it, don't fight it, feel it Oh now, when we dance close together
With your cheek close to mine
And you begin to feel a funny little thrill
Moving up your spine
Don't fight it, don't fight it, feel it Oh now, baby when the swingin' music
Make you wanna flip
Don't be in pain tryin' to restrain
Go ahead and move your hips Oh baby when you're dancin' near me

This is a mean old world to live in all by yourself
This is a mean world to be alone without someone to call your own
This is a mean old world to try and live in all by yourself I wish I had someone, someone who'd love me true
I wish I had someone, someone who loved me true
If I had someone who loved me true then I know I wouldn't be so blue
This is a mean old world to try and live in all by yourself No, this is a mean old world to live in all by, by, by, by all by yourself
Mean old world to try and live in all by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by yourself
This is a mean world to be alone without someone to call your own
No, mean world to try and live in all by, by, by, by, by yourself Sometimes I find myself dreamin' I found a love
Sometimes I find myself dreamin' I found a love
Sometimes I dream I've really found a love
Someone who loved me true as the stars above
For this is a mean old world to try and live in, all by yourself Where do they go, the smoke rings I blow each night
What do they do
Those circles of blue and white?
Oh! why do they seem to pictures a dream above
Then why do they fade my phantom parade of love? Where do they end, the smoke rings I send on high?
Where are they hurled
When they've kissed the world goodbye!
Oh! I'd give my life to laugh at this strife below
I'd be a king I'd follow each ring I blow Puff puff puff puff your cares away
Puff puff puff night and day
Blow blow them into air silky little rings
Blow, blow them ev'ry where give your troubles wings
What do they tell and what is the spell they cast
Some of them fall and seem to recall the past
But most of them rise away to the skies of blue
Oh little smoke rings I love Summertime and the living is easy
Fish are jumping and the cotton is high
Your daddy's rich and your mama's good-looking
So hush, little baby don't you cry One of these mornings you're gonna rise up singing
The you spread your wings and take to the sky
But until that morning there is nothing can harm you
With daddy and the mommy standing by A fish was made to swim in the ocean
A boat was made to sail on the sea
As sure as there are stars above, I know, I know
You were made for me
You were made for me A grape was made to grow on a vine
An apple was made to grow on a tree
As sure as there are stars above, I know, I know
You were made for me We'll have our quarrels
And you'll upset me, but
What can I do?
You've been mine ever since I met you
And I'll never leave you
No I'll never leave you As sure as there's a heaven up above me
From you I know I'll never be free
As sure as there are stars above, I know, I know
You were made for me A fish was made to swim in the ocean
A boat was made to sail on the sea
As sure as there are stars above, I know, I know
You were made for me
You were made for me A grape was made to grow on a vine
An apple, an apple was made to grow on a tree
As sure as there are stars above, I know, I know
You were made for me We'll have our quarrels
And you'll upset me, but
What can I do?
You've been mine ever since I met you
And I'll never, never, never, never, never, never leave you As sure as there's a heaven up above me
From you I know I'll never be free, no no
As sure as there are stars above, I know, I know
You were made for me The things that I see
As I walk along the streets
That's heaven to me A little flower that blooms in May
A lovely sunset at the end of a day
Someone helping a stranger along the way
(That's heaven to me)
That's heaven to me The feeling I have when I hear a touching prayer
It makes me know, the Lord is somewhere
Even the birds flying around in the air
(That's heaven to me)
That's heaven to me, no It doesn't have to be a miracle
In order for me to see, I know
The goodness of my, my Savior
Is everywhere to me, woah, woah, woah Even the children playing in the street
Sing a friendly hello to everyone that they meet
Even the leaves blowing out, blowing out
Blowing out, blowing out on the tree
(That's heaven to me)

But she was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to know We'd laugh and we'd sing
And do the little things
That made my heart glow
But she was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to know Why did I give my heart so fast
It never will happen again
But I was a mere lad of sixteen
I've aged a year since then She was only sixteen, only sixteen
With eyes that would glow
But she was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to know (Then why did you give your heart so fast)

Goes a long way So, smile at her
When she does something wrong
Always be there to pick her up
And to make her strong

Just a little, a little love can do

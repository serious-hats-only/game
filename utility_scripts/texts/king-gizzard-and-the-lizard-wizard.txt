When it comes to the mother taking care of us
I know it's so conventional
But it don't make no sense at all But in fact it's a pattern
Everything I hear will always make me ashen
I know its recognizable
But It don't make no sense at all Ohhhh no no no sense at all People pay for their coupe
But they can't pay their taxes for the freeway
I know it's so predictable
But it don't make no sense at all And some people say it's on their radar
But they drive a million miles in their fast car
I know it's so invisible

And I have not the candid heart to keep it's burden clandestine
For it's gravity is as weighty as a mountain capped in snow
And it's memory repeats inside of me, ostinato
And every time I think of the Balrog, I recall
The fear upon their faces and the doomed fate of them all
I saw death become of light, and life become of fire
I saw it from my hiding place, within the quagmire
I bringeth forth the drama, unabridged, and unignored
The battle of the Balrog, and the mighty I know I see
An altered beast by the tree Find a place to hide
Where I could steal a peep
Look to the sky
And I see angels weep I see you
And I can see right through
I see you
And I will take you to my Altered World Nine white teeth

I am an Altered Beast To whence, you making sun
To make frost a like stoned
Ware to make's a bed
I was the crush, I laugh hello! I jet believed in is frozen
Is the custom, I morrow's she
Want to river. I have flowing
Just to river. I have the flowing down
Down... Down... Down... A the river... Wants you made a led
And you can crawl and I sad
Found, we are a road
To make a frost, light wall note I cant believed, in this frozen, is the custom,
I had morrow's she want to liver, I have flowing
Just to river. I have the flowing down
Down... Down... Down... A the river. From steal of home
Fourth matches alone stone

Sick truth the moving flow I cant believed, in this frozen, is the custom,
I had morrow's she want to liver, I have flowing
Just to river. I have the flowing down
Down... Down... Down... A the river. Hello
My name is Han-Tyumi
I am a cyborg
Born
If you may call it that
In a world that is dense and black
Created without a desire to draw breath
Without a desire to have being
Without a yearning just to be
I'd like my desire back
My life back
My soul back
My humanity
Oh how I long for it
For an era I have meditated
Like the primordial Buddha beneath the Bodhi
My pseudo-mind pseudo-wandered
I climbed and I clambered
And I ambled upon some understanding
The gold beneath the virtual rainbow
I am bereft of two human things
Two things that a cyborg can never do
Two things that I strive for
Two things between myself and mankind
Death
And
To vomit
I want the perspiration
I want the nausea
I want to be sick
I want to feel the hot piquant nuggets
I want it to find passage through my cold figure
I want to make a mess
I want the odour
I want the spectacle
And I want it again
I want it all
And I would like to die
A noble death
Or a coward's death
A hero's death
Or a lonely death
To die in the arms of a lover
Or the arms of an alien
I desire my cache of experience to pulsate through my quasi-synapses
And then to be gone
Expired
Perish
Fallen
Dead
For evermore When I'm in your mind
Then I'm in your mind
When I'm in your mind fuzz
Then I'm in your mind So I'm going to break the 4th wall. It wouldn't hurt to give you more my love
The sun shines through into a wave of thought
You said the one I wed
has got a thinking hand on her
Her will will shine from up above on us
Cuz everyday I build on precious hurt and I
It wouldn't hurt to put in some work on this angel
I fill her heart with a lot of love so the sun can shine a little brighter On her and I
On her and I
On her and I
On her and I It wouldn't hurt to give you more my love
The sun shines through into a wave of thought

And we are reminded who lords over this altered world Floating fire sky
Everything will die Floating fire

Welcome to an altered future Gonna shake the world, shake the world off my back
I'm gonna hold my head high with the sun on my track
Today I've got no troubles in sight Gonna put some pop in my step when I walk
I'm gonna show my mood off when I walk and talk
Today I've got no troubles in sight
Gonna turn around, make everything that was wrong into right Gonna look past things that I know I'll regret
Cause life's a little too short for those worries, you can bet on me
Today I've got no troubles in sight
Gonna turn around, make everything that was wrong into...
Right, right When I wake up late in the morning, you'll know
It takes a few more hours before I'll know
Today I've got no troubles in sight
Gonna turn around, make everything that was wrong into...
Right, right, right, right Just yesterday I set a cross through my list
They were connected to me
And I couldn't see cause my eyes were in me
Hold me up straight while I screw my
Head on
Head on Just yesterday I helped a cup to my list
Pouring it deep in my throat
Staring at me like a black enemy
Hold me up straight while I screw my
Head on

Because everybody's sucking on fluoride
And everybody's filling into line
Because everybody's sucking on fluoride When I'm in your mind
Then I'm in your mind While everybody wants to suck you dry
And dig a little deeper in your mind - c'mon deeper
Everybody's lazy because they're fried
Because everybody's sucking on fluoride As soon as the dust settles, you can see
A new world in place of where the old one had been
Your skin is crawling with dry, crusted mud
And your naked feet are wet in a pool of blood
And the whistle of the wind in your ears is so loud
That your memories have blown up in a mushroom cloud
And as your eyes accomodate, there appears by the meadow
A brute like a bear with a long, dark shadow
And you violently shake over what you have seen
As you remember the tale of the Altered Beast You can watch your movies in 3D
It's so strange with cellophane Do do do do, do do do do You can colour everything you see
It's so strange with cellophane You can watch your movies in 3D
It's so strange with cellophane Digital, oh! Despondent, lugubrious, no future
We turned our bodies to computer
We are our own nature, abuser
No future, computer, abuser I can tell every day I stay
All the whiteness turns to grey
All the grey to Cimmerian
As the black is setting in
Digital black, oh! We've sunken into our illusion
We've fashioned colossal confusion
I am the word of the last human
Illusion, confusion, last human I can see it all around the land
I can feel it with the back of my hand
I can hear a roaring silence
Of the murky caliginous
I've heard the dark beast has said
That the world is like a brittle egg
He can crush it with only breath
And he can bring a black wave of death
Digital black The last who feels the pain from the wound
The last to be birthed from the flesh of a womb
A wretched life in this altered place
There must be more I can embrace Oh!
No future, computer, abuser
Digital black!
Illusion, confusion, last human
Digit Digit Digit I know it every day I stay
All the whiteness turns to grey
All the grey to Cimmerian
As the black is setting in
Digital Let me mend the past
Let me see behind your mask
You finally go around
She stares at the ground
And acts if you're not there Locks on the door
Surveillance when you enter in
The hall such a pointless cause
Her cups on my wall
It's hard to be ignored Let me mend the past
And make ends meet at last
Before they bleed
Don't wanna come across too weak Let me mend the past
Let me mend the past
This will be the last time I ask
Let me mend the past And now dear listener, we crossed the foe
The foe with the weapons and heavy cargo
I am the sabre, the catapult, and bat
The top of the food chain in my habitat
I am the demon bearing misery and fear
And I spy you convulsing from way over here
I could pull you apart or I could cut you to pieces
I could make you bleed crimson tears from the lesions
But the thing that I lust for and the thing that I'll get
Is to take over your body and to be in your head I see you
I want to
Break your head
Crusty bread I won't quit
If you quit
See to it
That you slip I see you
I want to
Seize your brain
I'd like to put it in my head To me you are game, just a sweet bit of meat
Come closer and drink malevolence from my teat Tell me would you honestly
Dare to face up next to me
Sugar coated pills won't keep
You from feeling so woozy
I am an Altered Beast What harm could a mere mortal like you do?
I am the golden wolf and you are caribou
My left hand is a mouth and my right is a fork
I will pull you apart like a butcher pulls pork I see you
I want to
Make a waste
Of your home I won't leave
I might tease
I'll be there
Await your death, oh I see you
I want to
Seize your brain
I'd like to put it in my head I see you're nervous, I see you're fumbling
Come hither my friend, my stomach is rumbling Tell me would you honestly
Dare to face up next to me
Sugar coated pills won't keep
You from feeling so woozy Tell me would you honestly
Dare to face up next to me
Sugar coated pills won't keep
You from feeling so woozy I am an Altered Beast So I built a machine
A human machine
I made it with steel
And soy-protein
Born from a test tube
And into a vat
To live and to heave
And to die just like that I don't care
"Take a chance," you said
Melt the coins in your pants
But make no sound for me my friend
Be calm in the wind
Tearing through town
A dog-less bark
Is a lonely sound
The cold ground moans
Untold histories
It sings its birdsong
To me A family sleeps
At the crease
They died by fire
But they felt no heat
I could wear
A jumper sewn
Out of the
Irony We waste no time
Leaving in light
A different sun
Bakes the breeze tonight
My mind wanders
Alone
Let my body
Be aquatic
Burn us a road
Straight to the sea
I'll be your seatbelt
Baby A family sleeps
At the crease
They died by fire
But they felt no heat
I could wear
A jumper sewn
Out of the
Irony I could wear
A jumper sewn
Out of the
Ironycould wear
A jumper sewn
Out of the
Irony Bone
Hands and Toes, Feet and Head
Carrion to be fed
Well, any dog can chew over my bone
And all my words, well, they turn into blood
When my name's called, I am just a pile of bone
(Unintelligible???)
(Unintelligible???)
What could be inside my head?
Bone
Fingernails, chest, and feet
Carrion, good to eat
Any dog can chew over my bone
And all my words gonna turn into blood
When my gun's shot, I am just a pile of bone
(Unintelligible???)
(Unintelligible???)
What could be inside my head?
Will all the stitches be unsewn?
If heaven is a place I know,
I won't get to keep my bones
Bone
Heaven is a place I know
I won't get to keep my bones
Will all the stitches be unsewn?
(Unintelligible???)
(Unintelligible???)
What will be inside my head?
Bone Earth by the moon
Darker days come soon
Owl sings a tune
Surely she knows too Bird is waiting
Expectating
God is in the rhythm Earth by the sun
Brighter days to run
Rain knows the sun
Knows it's not time to come Rain is waiting
Expectating
God is in the rhythm Seasons move
Everybody knows it's true
Springs brings a dew
Hibernates winters tune Summer's waiting
Expectating
God is in the seasons Trees know it too
The perfect time to bloom
The leaf asks the sun
Knows his time has come Leaf is waiting
Expectating
God is in the rhythm Wind blows a song
From the desert to the pond
Frog waves the wand
And the wind blows on beyond Frog is waiting
Expectating
God is in the rhythm Earth by the stars
We have all come from Mars
We all know it too
We belong to the soup We are waiting
Expectating
God is in the rhythm You brought us to your gift of generosity
And all our silly games wreak havoc on your soils
When I stop to think of that Every life is like a song that takes forever to be sung
When all our silly games wreak havoc on our spoils
When I stop to think of all that we've done
Satan's at the door Every second, every minute, every hour, every day
He's watching you and passing judgement to everybody you hold dear
When I stop to think of all that we've done
Satan's at the door
Who's he looking for? The spatter becomes a spray, the spray becomes a stream
And the stream becomes the waterfall
Munt is finally cascading from my input
The creeping sick moves from my breath
And into my heart where it is pumped to every inch of my body
I feel it snake through the knots of my deepest veins
And eats through the walls of my cells
It bleeds through the pores of my skin
And it smells good
It drops from my crotch on to the floor
And with a heavy slap it hits the ground and spreads
Inside my body
The pressure is too great
And like some ancient geyser I erupt
My head hits the roof and my body breaks apart with the force of the liquid blast
Vomit bomb
Chunky shrapnel tears through everything around me
I am vomit vomiting
I grow and disperse
Bleeding through walls
I force myself upon others
I slide up legs and crawl down throats
I integrate
I am double
Triple
I am ten times the size
I turn lakes into porridge and buildings into bile
I am a noxious soup filling valleys with vomit-torrents
Castles crumble in landslides and I munch the rubble
It tastes good
Ten thousand times bigger
I seep into power sockets and travel along the wires
At the speed of light across vast electrical networks
I am electric
I am on fire
This is sex
I am every one and every zero
One million
I am supercharged flaming puke storming every cell molecule and atom I can find
I am cancer
I am flying
I am a rainbow unfurling across the sky
I am floating
I am omni
Five hundred million
The world is my interior
It no longer spins
It is altered
My density forces me outward
I am in orbit
One billion
I am Saturn's rings and Jupiter's storms
I am the weather
I am the sun's heat
I am the night sky
Five hundred billion
The solar system is puke
To the Kuiper belt and beyond
I fill the void
Exploding suns, vomit comets
Comets vomit acid rain
Spilt milk over the milky way
One trillion
The stars are my cells
Racing faster outwards
Upwards
Downwards
Inwards
Losing track of my place in the vomit-verse
Every nowhere
I am heavy
I am gravity
Nebulas pregnant with barf pulsate and burst
Expansion
I shoot arrows of time in all directions
I am a black hole shitting into the void
I tear through the skin of perception and into the next
Nonillion
The cosmic microtone background becomes transparent
Like rising damp
Munt soaks into the walls of the cosmos
And it topples like soggy bread
I am dark energy accelerating
Multiverse
Entanglement
I am time
Centillion
Time is sick
Critical density
Contraction
Singularity
Everything and nothing
Life and death Murder of the universe I saw you in the carpet shades
Then I felt you like a baby's face
Just float along and fill your lungs
Flot along and breathe a deep breath I saw you in the paper folds
And I saw you in my coffee mug
Just float along and fill your lungs
Float along and breathe a deep breath Just float along and fill your lungs
Just float along and fill your lungs
Just float along and breathe a deep breath
Just float along and fill your lungs At 30 past 7 you know I could be better
At 30 past 2 I'll get along with you
I'm grumpy in the morning
You know that when I'm yawning, it's true That I'll be snappy towards you
That I'll bite pieces out of you I need to slow my mind down low
I need to slow my mind down low
I need to slow my mind down low And when it feels like coming home
Or it makes it hard to talk
For me
For me I need to slow my mind down low
I need to slow my mind down low And when it feels like coming home
Or it makes it hard to talk
For me
For me For all it's revulsion, and warp, and taboo
A part of you wants to be altered too Altered beast

Points his strong finger our way
Electricity escapes

Bombs are smacking
Cat o' tails
Whips her lashings Lord of Lightning moves our way
Sends a crooked look at me
Electricity escapes
Lights the sky in citrine fleece Lightning, oh! Nonagon, nonagon
Nonagon infinity, yup! One more time the vault lights up with carnival of paint
I endeavor to watch the panic, but I worry that I will faint Floating fire
Golden wire
Silver trails
Flashing spire
Guns are cracking
Bombs are smacking
Cat o' tails
Whips her lashings Lord of Lightning's closer now
Our world's only rain and cloud
I'm not sure we have the power
Need to smite this evil down Lightning, oh! Nonagon, nonagon
Nonagon infinity, yup!
Nonagon, nonagon, oh! And from the Lords electric snare
One goes in his electric chair Lord of Lightning shifts his gaze
Points his strong finger our way
Electricity escapes
Leaves destruction in our wake His electric trap has electric cyanide
The luckless hostage has been thoroughly fried Lightning, oh! Nonagon, nonagon
Nonagon infinity, yes! And as the cadaver lay static with open crusted eyes
The smoking corpse began to twitch at my great surprise
Then the figure sprung up and at once it caught alight
And the creature known as Balrog was born that very night I think I see
An altered beast
By the tree Take a peek
If you would dare
Half made of man
Half of bear He came from underneath
I met an altered beast I think I see
An altered beast
By the creek Altered face and altered skin
Altered born of altered kin He came from underneath
I met an altered beast I think I see
An altered beast
In my dreams In a dream, you can wake in your bed without pain
But know with conviction, it's here you'll remain I met an altered beast With an unsteady gait, the creature moves forth
Feel his rhythm as he tramples the earth
And you stare at his figure, stupefied in dread
As his gaze locks to yours and bores into your head
And the pulse is so loud on the inside of your brain
And you find that your feet are stuck to the terrain
Closer he comes, making dust out of stone
Forsaken you are, and what's more, all alone I think I see
An altered beast
By the tree I met an altered beast Drifting in and out of sleep
Is my favourite state to be
I can see you next to me
And it is lovely Sleep drifter, Sleep drifter I can feel you touch me
And I can hear you breathing
Please no one wake me
When I'm sleep drifting Drifting in and out of sleep
Reality begins to fray
You'll become so close to me
In a hotel far away Sleep drifter, Sleep drifter I can know you're right here
And I can catch your crying tear
We can be so close, dear
When I'm sleep drifting Drifting in and out of sleep
Is my favourite state to be
I can see you next to me
And it is lovely Sleep drifter, Sleep drifter I can feel you touch me
And I can hear you breathing
Please no one wake me
When I'm sleep drifting I can know you're right here
And I can catch your crying tear
We can be so close, dear
When I'm sleep drifting I can feel you touch me
And I can hear you breathing
Please no one wake me
When I'm sleep drifting Sleep drifter, Sleep drifter
Sleep drifter, Sleep drifter
Sleep drifter, Sleep drifter
Sleep drifter, Sleep drifter I can feel you touch me
And I can hear you breathing
Please no one wake me
When I'm sleep drifting Empty
Life is nothing like it used to be
People used to be so nice to me
Feeling so empty
Empty
There is nothing deep inside of me
Life is nothing like it used to be
Feeling so empty
Life is still I am my mother's son
And I'll keep doin' 'til the done gets done
I wouldn't steal for free
And I won't see you next to me 'Cos I, oh, I
I, oh, I hope I don't wake up 'Cos I'm a lonely soul
And I've got no friends on this road
And I'm a mystery Jack
The lines on my hands tell me I'm on track to die Oh, die
'Cos I, oh, I hope I don't wake up It's always in between the lines you thought you read
The time and distance, keyhole, needle through the thread
I can't help but be sad sometimes
Talk to me see what's on my mind If I could step backwards somewhere into the past
I'd relive that great party where we had a blast
Pondering things in the past makes you blind
Look ahead you'll not waste your... Time mends furrowed brows
I can't help but thinking now
Back here I'll wait
Please don't let the past be my... fate It takes two cats to enjoy a cool jamboree
It takes three to remember that one differently
Memory's a fog it gets thicker with time
Look at the clock its hands read the... Time mends furrowed brows
I can't help but thinking now
Back here I'll wait
Please don't let the past be my fate Oh, vomit coffin
Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin I don't feel blessed
With the vomit
In my chest
I feel like coughing Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin, oh Queasy green
Rotten scoff
Vomit cough And when I declared to my design
Like Frankenstein's monster
"I am your father, I am your god
And you the magic that I conjure"
The thankless swine
The blasphemous jerk
My creature had no love for me
Which made me berserk I am covered in vomit
I am coated in sick
I have no name and no place
This is no way to live So I took over my creation
The spew coated protein
I plugged myself in
And became one with machine I don't feel blessed
With the vomit
In my neck
I feel like death Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin Filthy green
Rotten scoff Vomit, vomit, vomit, vomit
Vomit, vomit, vomit, vomit cough You don't feel a thing in your sinuous head
No love, no pain, and no fear of dread
Your apathetic dispassion has made you distort
And your savoir faire is to kill for sport
You'd wound a small creature and watch it wiggle
And lust to feel so bad, that you'd force a giggle
So crooked and curled is your point of view
There is no other creature more malicious than you I'm completely satisfied
My other life I will not miss
An altered beast until I die
And I will not give up on this
Never! True, I went to hell and back
But it was so I could be this
An altered beast until the end
And I will not give up on this
Never! I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
Altered Beast protect me
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything You're ruthless, and savage, and sadistic, and vindictive
And you find human flesh is incredibly addictive
But the longer you live, and the longer you kill
There's a void that gets harder, and harder to fill
The void that you feel within would suggest
That a canyon has opened up inside of your chest
And whatever you do, there's no turning back
You've reached the end of the cul-de-sac Emptiness inside of me
And hollowness all around me
I cut myself to see it bleed
And now I don't feel anything
Never! Insincere and trivial
The world is void of all meaning
And God is so less visceral
And now I don't feel anything
Never! I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
Altered Beast protect me
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
Altered Beast protect me
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything The sole thing that will make your void obsolete
Is to find someone new, some sapid, fresh meat Altered beast, alter me
Altered beast, alter me I think I see
An Altered Beast
Inside me I am an Altered Beast And as the acrid Balrog corpse smolders just like it began
Its crimson-orange light melts into the setting sun
And leaving us not without a final clap of light
The Lightning Lord escapes
As day fades into moonless night Well, I'm not a man unless I have a woman
Well, I'm not a man unless I have a woman She's a hundred pounds of gold
(Yes I am)
She's a hundred pounds of gold
(He's a hundred pounds of gold)
I got mine so I don't mind - no I'm not a woman unless I have a man
I'm not a woman unless I have a man I ain't gonna break your heart
(Yeah, I know you won't)
Because I'm done breaking hearts Meet me at the house on the top of the hill
I've got two importante people that I'm ready to kill
I'll just flunk or fail so give me something better to do Santa's on the roof, with his presents and sack
He's got one hand with a blade and the other's an axe
I'll just flunk or fail so give me something better to do Then I hear God call
And all my hate is gone
I hear Him calling me back home Oh, I hear God call
And now my hate is gone
I heard Him calling me back home God is calling me back home... Got ideas in my bran about the end of the world that i won't even say. And all the bricks that fill our brain will be turned into sand by the eternal wave. ohhh if we save her leave all the stuff

Big chook Are you you? Are you me?
Or someone in between?
You lost track inside the labyrinth
You lost your will and your sanity
You certainly lost your humanity
In life, you have taken much more than you're worth
Now it's your turn to give back to the Earth
May you return to the ground and ossify
It's time for you to die, die, die Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog, yep! You made the atom split
It caused a massive rift
And he came screaming through
Here to bite the head from you Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog, yep, oh! Balrog fears not the Lightning Lord
He's fixed on us, has him ignored Feel a tingle
Rolling up your left arm when you
Think of evil
Lurking in the darkness where you
Shine your eyesight
Something tells you this is not right
Take some advice
Have you heard the murmurings of Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, yep, oh! You caused a massive rift
You made the atom split
And it came screaming through
Here to bite the head off you Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog I build the bravery to sneak a glimpse at it's expression
And beyond the flames I see him smirk at our present depression
I fear that God's a chef and he's thrown us into a great pot
He is here, fully formed, and glowing red and lapis hot Heated menace
Comes to gouge the heart out from us
Blazing zealot
Preaching on the apocalypse
I don't want to
Submit to his awful torture
Save me from him
Have you heard the murmurings of Balrog, balrog
Balrog, oh! Skin begins to burn
There's nowhere we can turn
There's no way we can win
The devil puppets him
His pyre muscles flex
We are his next subjects
His power has us floored
Kneel before the overlord Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, yes, oh! For them, the future was as laid out as the burnt path he swathe
And so the damned remaining lot knelt before the red Behemoth
And as they prepared for afterlife there appeared the endemic monstrosity
The Lighting Lord is back and charged the Balrog with animosity
Furious he pummeled his breast, and a blaze alit the heavens
The stage was set for war, and to the Balrog, the Lord's finger beckoned

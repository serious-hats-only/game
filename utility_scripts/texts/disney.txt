URSULA
The only way to get what you want is to become a human yourself. ARIEL
Can you do that? [URSULA]
My dear, sweet child. That's what I do. It's what I live for.
To help unfortunate merfolk like yourself.
Poor souls with no one else to turn to.
I admit that in the past I've been a nasty
They weren't kidding when they called me, well, a witch
But you'll find that nowadays
I've mended all my ways
Repented, seen the light, and made a switch
True? Yes
And I fortunately know a little magic
It's a talent that I always have possessed
And here lately, please don't laugh
I use it on behalf
Of the miserable, lonely, and depressed pathetic Poor unfortunate souls
In pain, in need
This one longing to be thinner
That one wants to get the girl
And do I help them?
Yes, indeed
Those poor unfortunate souls
So sad, so true
They come flocking to my cauldron
Crying, "Spells, Ursula, please!"
And I help them!
Yes I do Now it's happened once or twice
Someone couldn't pay the price
And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em 'cross the coals
Yes I've had the odd complaint
But on the whole I've been a saint
To those poor unfortunate souls
Have we got a deal? [ARIEL]
If I become human, I'll never be with my father or sisters again. [URSULA]
But you'll have your man, heh heh. Life's full of tough choices, isn't it? Heh heh.
Oh, and there is one more thing.
We haven't discussed the subject of payment. [ARIEL]
But I don't have- [URSULA]
I'm not asking much, just a token really, a trifle!
What I want from you is - your voice. [ARIEL]
But without my voice, how can I- [URSULA]
You'll have your looks, your pretty face.
And don't underestimate the importance of body language, ha!
The men up there don't like a lot of blabber
They think a girl who gossips is a bore!
Yes on land it's much preferred for ladies not to say a word
And after all dear, what is idle prattle for?
Come on, they're not all that impressed with conversation
True gentlemen avoid it when they can
But they dote and swoon and fawn
On a lady who's withdrawn
It's she who holds her tongue who get's a man
Come on you poor unfortunate soul
Go ahead!
Make your choice ! I'm a very busy woman and I haven't got all day
It won't cost much
Just your voice!
You poor unfortunate soul
It's sad but true
If you want to cross the bridge, my sweet
You've got the pay the toll
Take a gulp and take a breath
And go ahead and sign the scroll
Flotsam, Jetsam, now I've got her, boys
The boss is on a roll
This poor unfortunate soul Beluga sevruga
Come winds of the Caspian Sea
Larengix glaucitis
Et max laryngitis
La voce to me Now, sing! [ARIEL]
Aah... [URSULA]
Keep singing! Look at me,
I may never pass for a perfect bride, or a perfect daughter.
Can it be,
I'm not meant to play this part?
Now I see, that if I were truly to be myself,
I would break my family's heart. Who is that girl I see, staring straight back at me?
Why is my reflection someone I don't know?
Somehow I cannot hide?
Who I am, though I've tried.
When will my reflection show, who I am, inside?
How I pray, that a time will come,
I can free myself, from their expectations
On that day, I'll discover someway to be myself,
and to make my family proud.
They want a docile lamb,
No-one knows who I am.
Must there be a secret me,
I'm forced to hide?
Must I pretend that I am someone else for all time?
When will my reflection show, who I am inside?
When will my reflection show, who I am inside? It's a world of laughter
A world of tears
It's a world of hopes
And a world of fears
There's so much that we share
That it's time we're aware
It's a small world after all It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small, small world There is just one moon
And one golden sun
And a smile means
Friendship to every one
Though the mountains divide
And the oceans are wide
It's a small world after all It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small, small world When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
Will come to you
If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of
Their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Suddenly, it comes to you
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true
When a star is born
They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true
When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
Will come to you,
If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of
Their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Suddenly, it comes to you
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll
What a pro!
Herc could stop a show
Point him at a monster and you're talking S.R.O. He was a no one
A zero, zero
Now he a hot shot
He's a hero
He was a kid with his act down pat
From zero to hero in no time flat
Zero to hero, just like that! When he smiled the girls went wild
With oohs and ahhs
And they slapped his face on ev'ry vase
(On every vahse) From appearance fees and royalties
Our Herc had cash to burn
Now nouveau riche and famous
He could tell you what's a Grecian "earn"! Say "Amen"
There he goes again
Sweet and undefeated
And an awesome 10 for 10
Folks lined up
Just to watch him flex
And this perfect package packed a pair of pretty pecs Hercie, he comes, he sees, he conquers
Honey, the crowds were going bonkers
He showed the moxie, brains, and spunk
From zero to hero
A major hunk
Zero to hero
And who'd have thunk? Who put the "glad" in "gladiator"?
Hercules!
Whose daring deeds are great theater?
Hercules!
Is he bold?
No one braver!
Is he sweet?
Our favorite flavor! Hercules, Hercules
Hercules, Hercules
Hercules, Hercules Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Undefeated
Riding high
And the nicest guy
Not conceited He was a nothin'
A zero, zero
Now he's a hot-shot
He's our hero
He hit the heights at breakneck speed! From zero to hero
Herc is a hero
Now he's a hero Yes indeed! [Intro]
Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly [Verse 1]
Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the beast [Pre-Chorus]
Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Ever just as sure
As the sun will rise [Chorus]
Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song [Verse 2]
Bitter sweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong [Bridge]
Certain as the sun
Rising in the east [Chorus]
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast x2 [Outro]
Off to the cupboard with you Chip it's past your bed time
Goodnight love Well, Ali Baba had them forty thieves,
Scheherazade had a thousand tales.
But master you're in luck, 'cause up your sleeves
You've got a brand of magic never fails You've got some power in your corner now!
Some heavy ammunition in your camp!
You got some punch, pizzaz, yahoo and how...
See, all you gotta do is rub that lamp, and I'll say: Chorus:
"Mr. Aladdin, sir, what will your pleasure be?
Let me take your order, jot it down?"
You ain't never had friend like me Life is your restaurant and I'm your maitre'd
Come on whisper what it is you want;
You ain't never had friend like me! Yes sir, we pride ourselves on service.
You're the boss, the king, the shah.
Say what you wish; it's yours, true dish.
How 'bout a little more baklava? Have some of column A try All of column B,
I'm in the mood to help you, dude.
You ain't never had friend like me Oh my. No no. My my my.
Can your friends do this?
Can your friends do that?
Can your friends pull this
Out their little hat?
Can your friends go poof?
Well looky here!
Can your friends go abracadabra, let her rip,
And then make the sucker disappear? So don't just sit there slack-jawed, buggy-eyed,
I'm here to answer all your midnight prayers,
You've got me bona fide certified;
You've got a genie for charge d'affaires. I've got a powerful urge to help you out,
So what you wish, I really wanna know?
You've got a list that's three miles long, no doubt,
Well all you've gotta do is rub like so, and oh Â­- Mr. Aladdin, sir, have a wish or two or three.
I'm on the job you big nabob!
You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend,
You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend,
You ain't never had a friend like me.
You ain't never had a friend like me I've been staring at the edge of the water
Long as I can remember
Never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water
No matter how hard I try Every turn I take
Every trail I track
Every path I make
Every road leads back to the place I know
Where I cannot go
Where I long to be See the line where the sky meets the sea
It calls me
And no one knows how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go I know everybody on this island
Seems so happy on this island
Everything is by design
I know everybody on this island
Has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine I can lead with pride
I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me See the light as it shines on the sea
It's blinding
But no one knows how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me
So come find me
And let me know
What's beyond that line
Will I cross that line The line where the sky meets the sea
It calls me
And no one knows how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
How far I'll go Salagadoola mechicka boola bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined
And now he's dear and so unsure
I wonder why I didn't see it there before Beast: She glanced this way, I thought I saw
And when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw
No it can't be, I'll just ignore
But then she's never looked at me that way before Belle: New and a bit alarming
Who'd have ever thought that this could be?
True that he's no Prince Charming
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see Lumiere: Well, who'd have thought? Cogsworth: Well, who'd have known? Lumiere: And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own? All three: We'll wait and see
A few days more
There may be something there that wasn't there before Cogsworth: You know, perhaps there's something there that wasn't there before Mrs Potts: There may be something there that wasn't there before The seaweed is always greener
In somebody else's lake
You dream about going up there
But that is a big mistake
Just look at the world around you
Right here on the ocean floor
Such wonderful things surround you
What more is you lookin' for? Under the sea
Under the sea
Darling it's better
Down where it's wetter
Take it from me
Up on the shore they work all day
Out in the sun they slave away
While we devotin'
Full time to floatin' Under the sea
Down here all the fish is happy
As off through the waves they roll
The fish on the land ain't happy
They sad 'cause they in their bowl
But fish in the bowl is lucky

One day when the boss get hungry
Guess who's gon' be on the plate? Under the sea

'Til you mean what you say
And love isn't love
'Til you give it away We've all got a gift
Yeah, something to give
To make a change Send it on, on and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part, reach a heart
Just one spark starts a fire With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make it strong
Shine a light, and send it on Just smile, and the world
Will smile along with you
That small act of love
Is meant for one who become two If we take the chances
To change circumstances
Imagine all we can do If we send it on, on and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part, reach a heart
Just one spark starts a fire With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make it strong
Shine a light, and send it on
Send it on, ooh, send it on There's power in all
Of the choices we make
So I'm starting now
There's not a moment to waste A word's just word
'Til you mean what you say
And love isn't love
'Til you give it away Send it on, on and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part, reach a heart
Just one spark starts a fire With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make it strong
Shine a light, and send it on Send it on, on and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part, reach a heart
Just one spark starts a fire With one little action
The chain reaction will help things start
Make it strong
Shine a light, and send it on
Shine a light, and send it on
Shine a light, and send it on [Gramma Tala:]
I know a girl from an island
She stands apart from the crowd
She loves the sea and her people
She makes her whole family proud
Sometimes the world seems against you
The journey may leave a scar
But scars can heal and reveal just
Where you are The people you love will change you
The things you have learned will guide you
And nothing on earth can silence
The quiet voice still inside you
And when that voice starts to whisper
Moana you've come so far
Moana listen
Do you know who you are? [Moana:]
Who am I?
I am a girl who loves my island
I'm the girl who loves the sea
It calls me
I am the daughter of the village chief
We are descended from voyagers
Who found their way across the world
They call me
I've delivered us to where we are
I have journeyed farther
I am everything I've learned and more
Still it calls me
And the call isn't out there at all, it's inside me
It's like the tide; always falling and rising
I will carry you here in my heart you'll remind me
That come what may
I know the way
I am Moana! I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide? I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us "No"
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But now from way up here
It's crystal clear
that now I'm in a whole new world with you Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky A whole new world
Don't you dare close your eyes
A hundred thousand things to see
Hold your breath - it gets better
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be A whole new world
Every turn a surprise
With new horizons to pursue
Every moment gets better
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you A whole new world (A whole new world)
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us "No"
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming
A whole new world
Every turn a surprise
With new horizons to pursue
Every moment, red letter
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you A whole new world
A whole new world
That's where we'll be
That's where we'll be
A thrilling chase
A wondrous place
For you and me I got myself a notion
And one I know that you'll understand
To set the world in motion by reaching out for each other's hand Maybe we'll discover
What we shoulda known all along
One way or another, together's where we both belong If we listen to each other's heart
We'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love is a reason why
For the first time ever, we're seein' it eye to eye If a wall should come between us
Too high to climb, too hard to break through
I know that love'll lead us
And find a way to bring me to you So don't be in a hurry
Think before you count us out
You don't have to worry
I won't ever let you drown
(Nothing's gonna stop us now) If we listen to each other's heart
We'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love is a reason why
For the first time ever, we're seein' it eye to eye Love is why we're seein' it eye to eye
(Yes, we are seein' it eye to eye)
Seein' it eye to
(Love is why we're seein' it)
I think we're seein' it eye to eye
(eye to eye)
eye to
We're seein' it eye to eye
(eye to eye!) If you're ever lonely, then stop!
You don't have to be
After all, it's only a beat away from you to me
(Take a look inside and see) If we listen to each other's heart
We'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love is a reason why
For the first time ever, we're seein' it eye to eye Seein' it eye to
Seein' it eye to eye
We're seein' it eye to eye, baby
For the first time
For the first time eye to eye
Seein't it
Seein' it, baby
Seein' it eye to
For the first time ever
Hey yeah
Seein' it, baby
We're seein' it eye to eye
Seein' it
(C'mon, baby) eye to eye
eye to eye
eye to eye
eye to eye
Yeah
eye to eye! (Spoken) Mama, I don't have time for dancing
(Sung) That's just gonna have to wait a while
Ain't got time for messing around
And it's not my style This old town can slow you down
People taking the easy way
But I know exactly where I'm going
I'm getting closer and closer everyday And I'm almost there
I'm almost there
People 'round here think I'm crazy
But I don't care Trials and tribulations
I've had my share
But there ain't nothing gonna stop me now
Cause I'm almost there I remember daddy told me
"Fairy tales can't come true
But you gotta make it happen
It all depends on you" So I work real hard each and everyday
Now things for sure are going my way
Just doing what I do
Look out boys I'm coming through And I'm almost there
I'm almost there
People gonna come here from everywhere
And I'm almost there I'm almost there There's been trials and tribulations
You know I've had my share
But I've climbed a mountain, I've crossed a river
And I'm almost there I'm almost there I'm almost there La la lu, La la lu

Heave ho, thieves and beggars;

we lay to the fiddler's green. Yo ho haul together,

Heave ho, thieves and beggars;

A call to all; pay heed the squall,

Fly, of course!
Fly!
It's easy! All you have to do is to...is to...is to--
Huh. That's funny!
What's the matter?
Don't you know?
Oh sure, it's, it's just that I never thought about it before.
Say, that's it! You think of a wonderful thought!
Any happy little thought?
Uh-huh
Like toys at Christmas? Sleight bells? Snow?
Yep! Watch me now--here I go!
It's easier than pie! He can fly! He can fly! He flewed!
Now, you try
I'll think of a mermaid lagoon
Oh--underneath a magic moon
I'll think I'm in a pirate's cave
I'll think I'll be an Indian brave
Now, everybody try--one, two, three!
We can fly! We can fly! We can fly!
This won't do--what's the matter with you?
All it takes is faith and trust...oh!
And something I forgot--Dust!
Dust? Dust?
Yep! Just a little bit of pixie dust Now, think of the happiest things.
It's the same as having wings
Let's all try it, just once more
Look! We're rising off the floor
Jiminy! Oh my! We can fly!
You can fly! We can fly!
Come on, everybody, here we go!
Off to Never Land! Think of a wonderful thought
Any merry little thought
Think of Christmas, think of snow
Think of sleigh bells - off you go!
Like a reindeer in the sky
You can fly! You can fly! You can fly! Think of the happiest things
It's the same as having wings
Take the path that moonbeams make
If the moon is still awake
You'll see him wink his eye
You can fly! You can fly! You can fly! Up you go with a heigh and ho
To the stars beyoond the blue
There's a Never Land waiting for you
Where all your happy dreams come true
Every dream that you dream will come true When there's a smile in your heart
There's no better time to start
Think of all the joy you'll find
When you leave the world behind
And bid your cares good-bye
You can fly! You can fly! You can fly! Spoken:
There it is, Wendy, second star to the right
and straight on 'til morning URSULA
The only way to get what you want is to become a human yourself. ARIEL
Can you do that? [URSULA]
My dear, sweet child. That's what I do. It's what I live for.
To help unfortunate merfolk like yourself.
Poor souls with no one else to turn to.
I admit that in the past I've been a nasty
They weren't kidding when they called me, well, a witch
But you'll find that nowadays
I've mended all my ways
Repented, seen the light, and made a switch
True? Yes
And I fortunately know a little magic
It's a talent that I always have possessed
And here lately, please don't laugh
I use it on behalf
Of the miserable, lonely, and depressed pathetic Poor unfortunate souls
In pain, in need
This one longing to be thinner
That one wants to get the girl
And do I help them?
Yes, indeed
Those poor unfortunate souls
So sad, so true
They come flocking to my cauldron
Crying, "Spells, Ursula, please!"
And I help them!
Yes I do Now it's happened once or twice
Someone couldn't pay the price
And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em 'cross the coals
Yes I've had the odd complaint
But on the whole I've been a saint
To those poor unfortunate souls
Have we got a deal? [ARIEL]
If I become human, I'll never be with my father or sisters again. [URSULA]
But you'll have your man, heh heh. Life's full of tough choices, isn't it? Heh heh.
Oh, and there is one more thing.
We haven't discussed the subject of payment. [ARIEL]
But I don't have- [URSULA]
I'm not asking much, just a token really, a trifle!
What I want from you is - your voice. [ARIEL]
But without my voice, how can I- [URSULA]
You'll have your looks, your pretty face.
And don't underestimate the importance of body language, ha!
The men up there don't like a lot of blabber
They think a girl who gossips is a bore!
Yes on land it's much preferred for ladies not to say a word
And after all dear, what is idle prattle for?
Come on, they're not all that impressed with conversation
True gentlemen avoid it when they can
But they dote and swoon and fawn
On a lady who's withdrawn
It's she who holds her tongue who get's a man
Come on you poor unfortunate soul
Go ahead!
Make your choice ! I'm a very busy woman and I haven't got all day
It won't cost much
Just your voice!
You poor unfortunate soul
It's sad but true
If you want to cross the bridge, my sweet
You've got the pay the toll
Take a gulp and take a breath
And go ahead and sign the scroll
Flotsam, Jetsam, now I've got her, boys
The boss is on a roll
This poor unfortunate soul Beluga sevruga
Come winds of the Caspian Sea
Larengix glaucitis
Et max laryngitis
La voce to me Now, sing! [ARIEL]
Aah... [URSULA]
Keep singing! All those days watching from the windows
All those years outside looking in
All that time never even knowing
Just how blind I've been
Now I'm here blinking in the starlight
Now I'm here suddenly I see
Standing here it's all so clear
I'm where I'm meant to be And at last I see the light
And it's like the fog has lifted
And at last I see the light
And it's like the sky is new
And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted
All at once everything looks different
Now that I see you All those days chasing down a daydream
All those years living in a blur
All that time never truly seeing
Things, the way they were
Now she's here shining in the starlight
Now she's here suddenly I know
If she's here it's crystal clear
I'm where I'm meant to go And at last I see the light And it's like the fog has lifted And at last I see the light And it's like the sky is new And it's warm and real and bright
And the world has somehow shifted
All at once everything is different
Now that I see you Now that I see you You think you own whatever land you land on The Earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know every rock and tree and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name
You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew
Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned? Can you sing with all the voices of the mountains?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest Come taste the sunsweet berries of the Earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once, never wonder what they're worth
The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends And we are all connected to each other
In a circle, in a hoop that never ends
How high will the sycamore grow?
If you cut it down, then you'll never know And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or whether we are white or copper skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountains
We need to paint with all the colors of the wind
You can own the Earth and still
All you'll own is Earth until
You can paint with all the colors of the wind Somewhere out there,
Beneath the pale moonlight,
Someone's thinking of me,
And loving me tonight. Somewhere out there,
Someone's saying a prayer,
That we'll find one another,
In that big somewhere out there. And even though I know how very far apart we are,
It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star,
And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby,
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky! Somewhere out there,
If love can see us through,
Then we'll be together,
Somewhere out there,
Out where dreams
Come true... So many times out there
I've watched a happy pair of lovers walking in the night
They had a kind of glow around them
It almost looked like heaven's light I knew I'd never know that warm and loving glow
Though I might wish with all my might
No face as hideous as my face
Was ever meant for heaven's light But suddenly an angel has smiled at me
And kissed my cheek without a trace of fright I dare to dream that she might even care for me
And as I ring these bells tonight
My cold dark tower seems so bright
I swear it must be Heaven's light Confiteor deo omnipotenti
(I confess to God almighty)
Beatae Mariae semper virgini
(To blessed Mary ever virgin)
Beato Michaeli archangelo
(To the blessed Archangel Michael)
Sanctis apostolis omnibus sanctis
(To the Holy Apostles, to all the saints) Beata Maria, you know I am a righteous man
Of my virtue I am justly proud
Et tibit Pater
(And to you, Father) Beata Maria, you know I'm so much purer than
The common, vulgar, weak, licentious crowd
Quia peccavi nimis
(That I have sinned) Then tell me, Maria, why I see her dancing there?
Why her smold'ring eyes still scorch my soul
Cogitatione
(In thought) I feel her, I see her, the sun caught in her raven hair
Is blazing in me out of all control
Verbo et opere
(In word and deed) Like fire, Hellfire
This fire in my skin
This burning desire
Is turning me to sin
It's not my fault Mea culpa
(Through my fault)
I'm not to blame
Mea culpa
(Through my fault) It is the gypsy girl
The witch who sent this flame
Mea maxima culpa
(Through my most grievous fault)
It's not my fault
Mea culpa
(Through my fault) If in God's plan
Mea culpa
(Through my fault)
He made the devil so much
Stronger than a man
Mea maxima culpa
(Through my most grievous fault) Protect me, Maria
Don't let this siren cast her spell
Don't let her fire sear my flesh and bone
Destroy Esmeralda
And let her taste the fires of hell
Or else let her be mine and mine alone Minister Frollo, the gypsy has escaped
What? No longer in the cathedral, she's gone
But how? Never mind, get out, you idiot
I'll find her, I'll find her if I have to burn down all of Paris Hellfire, dark fire
Now gypsy, it's your turn
Choose me or your pyre
Be mine or you will burn Kyrie Eleison
(Lord, have mercy)
God, have mercy on her
Kyrie Eleison
(Lord, have mercy) God, have mercy on me
Kyrie Eleison
(Lord, have mercy)
But she will be mine
Or she will burn [Timon and (Pumbaa)]
I can see what's happening (What?)
And they don't have a clue (Who?)
They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line - our trio's down to two. (Oh.) [In a sarcastic mock-French accent]
Ze sweet caress of twilight
[Back to normal, but still sarcastic]
There's magic everywhere
And with all this romantic atmosphere
Disaster's in the air [Chorus]
Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things [Simba:]
So many things to tell her
But how to make her see
The truth about my past? Impossible!
She'd turn away from me [Nala:]
He's holding back, he's hiding
But what, I can't decide
Why won't he be the king I know he is
The king I see inside? [Chorus]
Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things
Can you feel the love tonight?
You needn't look too far
Stealing through the night's uncertainties
Love is where they are [Timon:]
And if he falls in love tonight
It can be assumed [Pumbaa:]
His carefree days with us are history [Timon and Pumbaa:]

And now we invite you to relax, let us pull up a
chair as the dining room proudly presents

Put our service to the test
Tie your napkin 'round your neck, cherie
And we provide the rest
Soup du jour
Hot hors d'oeuvres

A culinary cabaret
You're alone
And you're scared
But the banquet's all prepared
No one's gloomy or complaining
While the flatware's entertaining
We tell jokes
I do tricks
With my fellow candlesticks
And it's all in perfect taste
That you can bet
Come on and lift your glass
You've won your own free pass
To be out guest
If you're stressed
It's fine dining we suggest
Be our guest Be our guest
Be our guest Life is so unnerving
For a servat who's not serving
He's not whole without a soul to wait upon
Ah, those good old days when we were useful
Suddenly those good old days are gone
Ten years we've been rusting
Needing so much more than dusting
Needing exercise, a chance to use our skills Most days we just lay around the castle
Flabby, fat and lazy
You walked in and oops-a-daisy! It's a guest
It's a guest
Sakes alive, well I'll be blessed
Wine's been poured and thank the Lord
I've had the napkins freshly pressed
With dessert
She'll want tea
And my dear that's fine with me
While the cups do their soft shoeing
I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing
I'll get warm
Piping hot
Heaven's sakes! Is that a spot?
Clean it up! We want the company impressed
We've got a lot to do
Is it one lump or two For you, our guest?
She's our guest
She's our guest
She's our guest Be our guest
Be our guest
Our command is your request
It's ten years since we had anybody here
And we're obsessed
With your meal With your ease
Yes, indeed, we aim to please
While the candlelight's still glowing
Let us help you
We'll keep going Course by course
One by one
'Til you shout, "Enough! I'm done!"
Then we'll sing you off to sleep as you digest
Tonight you'll prop your feet up
But for now, let's eat up
Be our guest
Be our guest
Be our guest
Please, be our guest I've been standing at the edge of the water
Long as I can remember
Never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water
No matter how hard I try Every turn I take
Every trail I track
Every path I make
Every road leads back to the place I know
Where I cannot go
Where I long to be See the light where the sky meets the sea
It calls me
No one knows how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go I know everybody on this island
Seems so happy on this island
Everything is by design
I know everybody on this island
Has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine I can lead with pride
I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me See the light as it shines on the sea
It's blinding
But no one knows how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me
So come find me
And let me know
What's beyond that line
Will I cross that line See the light where the sky meets the sea
It calls me
And no one knows how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
How far I'll go I'm the king of the swingers, the jungle V.I.P
I reached the top and had to stop
And that's what bothering me
I want to be a man, man-cub, and stroll right into town
And be just like those other men
I'm tired of monkeying around Ooh-bi-doo, I wan'na be like you
I want to walk like you, talk like you, too
You see it's true, an ape like me
Can learn to be like you, too Don't try to kid me, man-cub, I made a deal with you
What I desire is man's red fire to make my dream's come true
Now give me the secret, man-cub, come on, clue me what to do
Give me the power of man's red flower so I can be like you Ooh-bi-doo, I wan'na be like you
I want to walk like you, talk like you, too
You see it's true, an ape like me
Can learn to be like you, too Now I'm the king of the swingers, the jungle V.I.P.
I reached the top and had to stop
And that's what bothering me
I want to be a man, man-cub, and stroll right into town
And be just like those other men
I'm tired of monkeying around Swing to the left, swing to the right,
put your hands up if you loving life
Swing to the left, swing to the right,
put your hands up if you feeling nice Ooh-bi-doo, I wan'na be like you
I want to walk like you, talk like you, too
You see it's true, an ape like me

Can learn to be someone like you
Can learn to be someone like you
Oh I can learn to be someone like you, yeah I wanna be like you, you know
Damned if you do serious Do you wanna build a snowman? Come on lets go and play
I never see you anymore Come out the door
It's like you've gone away-
We used to be best buddies And now we're not
I wish you would tell me why!
Do you wanna build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman.
Okay, bye
Do you wanna build a snowman?
Or ride our bikes around the halls
I think some company is overdue
I've started talking to
the pictures on the walls-
It gets a little lonely
All these empty rooms
Just watching the hours tick by
Do you wanna build a snowman? It doesn't have to be a snowman . Okay, bye
Elsa Please, I know you're in there
People are asking where you've been
They say have courage, and I'm trying to
I'm right out here for you, just let me in
We only have each other
It's just you and me
What are we gonna do
Do you wanna build a Snowman
Do you wanna build a Snowman
It doesn't have to be a snowman.
Okay, bye Princess Rose:
I know you
I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you
That gleam in your eyes seems so familiar to me
And I know its true
That visions are seldom what they seem
But if I know you
I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once
The way you did once
Upon a dream But if I know you
I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once
Princess Rose and Prince
The way you did once
Upon a dream I know you
I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you
The gleam in your eyes seems so familiar to me And I know its true
That visions are seldom what they seem
But if I know you
I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once
The way I did once
Upon a dream Look at this stuff, isn't it neat?
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl
The girl who has everything?
Look at this trove, treasures untold
How many wonders can one cavern hold?
Looking around here you'd think
Sure, she's got everything
I've got gadgets and gizmos a plenty
I've got whozits and whatzits galore
You want thingamabobs? I've got twenty!
But who cares? No big deal,
I want more
I wanna be where the people are
I wanna see, wanna see them dancing
Walking around on those
What do you call 'em? Oh, feet
Flipping your fins you don't get too far
Legs are required for jumping, dancing
Strolling along down a
What's that word again?
Street Up where they walk, up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wandering free
Wish I could be, part of that world
What would I give if I could live
Out of these waters?
What would I pay to spend a day
Warm on the sand?
Betcha' on land, they understand
Bet they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women, sick of swimming
Ready to stand
I'm ready to know what the people know
Ask 'em my questions
And get some answers
What's a fire and why does it?
What's the word?
Burn?
When's it my turn?
Wouldn't I love, love to explore that shore up above?
Out of the sea
Wish I could be
Part of that world [Meg:]
If there's a prize for rotten judgement
I guess I've already won that
No man is worth the aggravation
That's ancient history, been there, done that! [Muses:] Who'd'ya think you're kiddin'
He's the Earth and heaven to you
Try to keep it hidden
Honey, we can see right through you
Girl, ya can't conceal it
We know how ya feel and
Who you're thinking of [Meg:]
No chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no [Muses:]
You swoon, you sigh
why deny it, uh-oh [Meg:]
It's too cliche
I won't say I'm in love
I thought my heart had learned its lesson
It feels so good when you start out
My head is screaming get a grip, girl
Unless you're dying to cry your heart out
Oh [Muses:]
You keep on denying
Who you are and how you're feeling
Baby, we're not buying
Hon, we saw ya hit the ceiling
Face it like a grown-up
When ya gonna own up
That ya got, got, got it bad [Meg:]
No chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no [Muses:]
Give up, give in
Check the grin you're in love [Meg:]
This scene won't play,
I won't say I'm in love [Muses:]
You're doin flips read our lips
You're in love [Meg:]
You're way off base
I won't say it
Get off my case
I won't say it [Muses:]
Now, don't be proud
It's O.K. you're in love [Meg:]
Oh
At least out loud,
I won't say I'm in love Look at me, I will never pass for a perfect bride
Or a perfect daughter
Can it be I'm not meant to play this part
Now I see
That if I'm truly myself, I would break my family's heart Who is that girl I see
Staring straight, back at me
Why is my reflection someone I don't know
Somehow I cannot hide
Who I am
Though I've tried
When will my reflection show who I am inside
When will my reflection show who I am inside I have often dreamed of a far off place
Where a great warm welcome will be waiting for me
Where the crowds will cheer when they see my face
And a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be I will find my way
I can go the distance
I'll be there someday
If I can be strong
I know every mile will be worth my while
I would go most anywhere to feel like I belong I am on my way
I can go the distance!
I don't care how far
Somehow I'll be strong
I know every mile will be worth my while
I would go most anywhere to find where I belong URSULA

Aah...
Keep singing! With tuppence for paper and strings
You can have your own set of wings
With your feet on the ground
You're a bird in a flight
With your fist holding tight
To the string of your kite Let's go fly a kite
Up to the highest height!
Let's go fly a kite and send it soaring
Up through the atmosphere
Up where the air is clear
Oh, let's go fly a kite! When you send it flyin' up there
All at once you're lighter than air
You can dance on the breeze
Over 'ouses and trees
With your first 'olding tight
To the string of your kite Oh, oh, oh!
Let's go fly a kite
Up to the highest height!
Let's go fly a kite and send it soaring
Up through the atmosphere
Up where the air is clear
Let's go fly a kite! Nants ingonyama bagithi baba
Sithi uhhmm ingonyama
Ingonyama Ingonyama And blinking, step into the sun
There's more to see than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done
There's far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rolling high
Through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round
It's the circle of life
And it moves us all
Through despair and hope
Through faith and love Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle
The circle of life
It's the circle of life
And it moves us all
Through despair and hope
Through faith and love
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle
The circle of life Seven a.m., the usual morning lineup
Start on the chores and sweep 'till the floor's all clean
Polish and wax, do laundry, and mop and shine up
Sweep again, and by then it's like 7:15
And so I'll read a book
Or maybe two or three
I'll add a few new paintings to my gallery
I'll play guitar and knit
And cook and basically
Just wonder when will my life begin?
Then after lunch it's puzzles and darts and baking
Paper mache, a bit of ballet and chess
Pottery and ventriloquy, candle making
Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch, take a climb
Sew a dress! And I'll reread the books
If I have time to spare
I'll paint the walls some more
I'm sure there's room somewhere
And then I'll brush and brush
And brush and brush my hair
Stuck in the same place I've always been
And I'll keep wanderin' and wanderin'
And wanderin' and wonderin'
When will my life begin?
And tomorrow night
The lights will appear
Just like they do on my birthday each year
What is it like
Out there where they glow?
Now that I'm older
Mother might just
Let me go Well Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam
I was a drab little crab once
Now I know I can be happy as a clam
Because I'm beautiful baby Did your granny say listen to your heart?
Be who you are on the inside?
I need three words to tear her argument apart: your granny lied I'd rather be shiny
Like a treasure from a sunken pirate wreck
Scrub the deck and make it look shiny
I will sparkle like a wealthy woman's neck
Just a sec, don't ya know
Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb
They chase anything that glitters, beginners
Oh and here they come, come, come to the brightest thing that glitters
Mmm fish dinners
I just love free food (free food) and you look like sea food (sea food) Well, well, well
Little Maui's havin' trouble with his look
You little semi, demi, mini god
Ouch what a terrible performance get the hook
Get it?
You don't swing it like you used to, man
Yet I have to give you credit from my start
And your tattoos on the outside
For just like you I made myself a work of art
I'll never hide
I can't I'm too shiny
Watch me dazzle like a diamond in the rough
Strut my stuff, my stuff is so shiny
Send your armies but they'll never be enough
My shell's too tough, Maui man
You can try, try, try but you can't expect a demigod to beat a decapod
Look it up
You will die, die, die now it's time for me to take apart your achin' heart Far from the ones who abandoned you
Chasin' the love of the humans who made you feel wanted
You tried to be tough but your armor's just not hard enough
Maui, now it's time to kick your heiney
Ever seen someone so shiny Soak it in 'cause it's the last you'll ever see
C'est la vie, mon ami
I'm so shiny
Now I'll eat you so prepare your final plea just for me
You'll never be quite as shiny
You wish you were nice and shiny Mary:
It's...
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough, you'll always sound precocious All (variously):
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay! Bert:
Because I was afraid to speak when I was just a lad,
my father gave me nose a tweak and told me I was bad
But then one day, I learned a word
that saved me achin' nose
Both:
The biggest word I ever heard and this is how it goes: Oh!
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough, you'll always sound precocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay! Mary:
He traveled all around the world and everywhere he went,
he'd use his word and all would say "There goes a clever gent." Bert:
When Dukes and maharajas pass the time of day with me,
I say me special word and then they ask me out to tea All (variously):
Oh!
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough, you'll always sound precocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay! Mary (spoken):
You know, you can say it backwards, which is
Dociousaliexpilisticfragicalirupes
But that's going a bit too far, don't you think? Bert (spoken):
Indubitably Mary:
So when the cat has got your tongue, there's no need for dismay
Just summon up this word and then you've got a lot to say
But better use it carefully or it could change your life
Busker (spoken): For example
Mary (spoken): Yes?
Busker (spoken): One night I said it to me girl
And now me girl's my wife!
Ow! And a lovely thing she is, too All (variously):
She's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,
not a footprint to be seen

De vrieskou daar zat ik toch al niet mee. Whale of a Tale
Disney
2000 Leagues Under the Sea
Got a whale of a tale to tell ya, lads
A whale of a tale or two
'Bout the flapping fish and girls I've loved
On nights like this with the moon above
A whale of a tale and it's all true,
I swear by my tatoo
There was Mermaid Minnie
Met her down in Madagascar
She would kiss me
Anytime that I would ask her
Then one evening
Her flame of love blew out
Blow me down and pick me up,
She swapped me for a trout!
Got a whale of a tale to tell ya, lads
A whale of a tale or two
'Bout the flapping fish and girls I've loved
On nights like this with the moon above
A whale of a tale and it's all true,
I swear by my tatoo
There was Typhoon Tessie
Met her on the coast of Java
When we kissed I
Bubbled up like molten lava
Then she gave me
The scare of my young life
Blow me down, and pick me up
She was the captain's wife!
Got a whale of a tale to tell ya, lads
A whale of a tale or two
'Bout the flapping fish and girls I've loved
On nights like this with the moon above
A whale of a tale and it's all true,
I swear by my tatoo
Then there was Harpoon Hannah
Had a face that made you shudder
Lips like Fish hooks
And a nose just like a rudder
If I kissed her
And held her tenderly
(Held her tenderly)
There's no sea monster big enough
To ever frighten me!
Got a whale of a tale to tell ya, lads
A whale of a tale or two
'Bout the flapping fish and girls I've loved
On nights like this with the moon above
A whale of a tale and it's all true,
I swear by my tatoo! We were stranger, starting out on a journey

The man with the strength of many.
Brave and bold with a heart of gold,
John Henry was a mighty man.
Born with a hammer right in his hand. Well, come on John,
You're the one that we're depending on.
Swing that hammer with all your might,
I know you can show them how to do it right. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a mighty man.
Born with a hammer,
A ten pound hammer,
A twenty pound hammer right in his hand. I heard John's mama liked to sew at night,
So he pulled down the moon for a little bit of light.
It took a lot of cooking to keep John fed,
Ten dozen eggs and eight loves of bread. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a mighty man.
Born with a hammer, born with a hammer,
Born with a hammer right in his hand. He plowed the earth so wide and deep,
The seed he sowed the ground had to keep.
His hammer hit the earth with such a mighty blow,
Everything he planted would jump up and grow. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a powerful man.
All our lives we've been so poor,
John let me show you what we're working for. Canaan Land, Canaan Land,
Everybody workin' for the Canaan Land.
Home and freedom hand in hand,
Workin' for the Canaan Land. Oh, movin' on down the line,
John Henry came right on time.
Movin' on down the line,
John Henry came right on time. Home and freedom hand in hand,
Workin' for the Canaan Land. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a mighty man.
John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a powerful man. Steel drivin' man,
John Henry was.
Steel drivin' man,
Oh yes he was.
So proud, defiant,
A gentle giant,
A steel drivin' natural man. Well, a-come on, John,
You're the one that we're dependin' on.
Swing that hammer, bust that rock,
Come on, give it everything you've got. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a mighty man.
Born with a hammer, born with a hammer,
Born with a hammer right in his hand. John and the drill made the valley shake,
Rumblin' almost caused an earthquake.
Thunder and lightning was everywhere,
Oh, Lord, that battle was beyond compare. John Henry, John Henry,
John Henry is a powerful man.
Born with a hammer, born with a hammer,
Born with a hammer right in his hand. No mountain too high,
No valley too low,
No river too wide,
No place too far to go. If you believe, you can overcome.
The battle is already won,
Just keep on keepin' on.
Stand tall, just like John. No matter who you are,
No matter where you're from,
Nothing can stop you,
From who you can become. Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John.
Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John. No matter who you are,
No matter where you're from,
Nothing can stop you,
From who you can become. Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John.
Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John.
Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John.
Just keep on keepin' on,
Stand tall, just like John. You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me When the road looks rough ahead
And you're miles and miles from your nice warm bed
You just remember what your old pal said Boy, you've got a friend in me
Yeah, you've got a friend in me You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me You've got troubles and I've got 'em too
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
We stick together and see it through 
'Cause you've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me Some other folks might be
A little bit smarter than I am
Bigger and stronger too, maybe
But none of them will ever love you
The way I do it's me and you Boy, and as the years go by
Our friendship will never die
You're gonna see it's our destiny You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me Hakuna Matata!
What a wonderful phrase
Hakuna Matata!
Ain't no passing craze
It means no worries
For the rest of your days
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna Matata! When he was a young warthog
When I was a young warthog
He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal
He could clear the savannah after every meal
I'm a sensitive soul though I seem thick-skinned
And it hurt that my friends never stood downwind And, oh, the shame!
(He was ashamed!)
Thought of changin' my name
(Oh, what's in a name?)
And I got downhearted
(How'd you feel?)
Every time that I -
Hey, Pumbaa, not in front of the kids
Oh, sorry Hakuna Matata!
What a wonderful phrase
Hakuna Matata!
Ain't no passing craze
It means no worries
For the rest of your days
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna Matata! Hakuna Matata
Hakuna Matata
Hakuna Matata
Hakuna -
It means no worries
For the rest of your days
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna Matata!
Hakuna Matata!
Hakuna Matata!
Hakuuuuuuna Matata!
Hakuna Matata!
Hakuna Matata!
Hakuuuuna Matata!
Hakuna Matata! Om jag bara kunde fÃ¥ honom att fÃ¶rstÃ¥...
Jag hÃ¥ller inte alls med honom
Jag fÃ¶rstÃ¥r inte hur en vÃ¤rld,
som skapat sÃ¥na underbara ting,
kan vara ond? RÃ¤knar man ting, tror man nog lÃ¤tt,
att det jag har mÃ¥ste vara komplett
Ser du en flicka i mig,
med allt hon kan Ã¶nska sig?
Och hon kan fÃ¥, pÃ¤rlor och guld,
letar hon lite Ã¤r skattgÃ¶mman full
Se dig omkring en gÃ¥ng till,
visst, hon har allt hon vill
Jag har saker som fÃ¥r dig att undra,
om jag nÃ¥nsin kan drÃ¶mma om fler
Vill du ha en manick? Jag har hundra...
Men vadÃ¥?
Jag vill ha,
nÃ¥got mer... Jag vill va med, mitt bland mÃ¤nniskor,
och jag vill se, jag vill se dom dansa
Vandra omkring pÃ¥ tvÃ¥... Vad dom nu heter? Jo, ben!
Fenor och stjÃ¤rt tar dig inte lÃ¥ngt, ben Ã¤r ett mÃ¥ste,
om man vill dansa,
och rÃ¤cka upp till en... Vad Ã¤r ordet nu? Gren... LÃ¥ngt ovanfÃ¶r, finns det ett land,
dÃ¤r man kan gÃ¥ i sol pÃ¥ en strand,
dÃ¤r man Ã¤r fri,
det kunde bli hela min vÃ¤rld Ge mig ett liv, ge mig en tid, ovanfÃ¶r ytan
LÃ¥t mig en dag, bara ett tag, fÃ¥ prÃ¶va pÃ¥
DÃ¶ttrar pÃ¥ land, stÃ¶ttar varann,
och jag vill, vÃ¤ldigt gÃ¤rna byta
Slippa simma, bli en kvinna,
redo att stÃ¥ FÃ¶rsÃ¶ka fÃ¶rstÃ¥ det dom andra vet
Be att dom svarar pÃ¥ mina frÃ¥gor:
Vad Ã¤r lÃ¥gor? Och hur blir det... Heter det... GlÃ¶d? Vem ger mig stÃ¶d, nÃ¤r jag Ã¤r svag?
Ska jag fÃ¥ gÃ¥ i solen en dag?
En utopi... Som kunde bli... Hela min vÃ¤rld... That morning sun peeks over the mountains
And all the rhinos rub their eyes
When they hear (hear what?)
Hear the jungle rhythm Those birds are tap-tap-tappin' the tree trunks
The busy bee hums as he flies
Loud and clear
To the jungle rhythm Now you can hightail it out of the jungle
But it never leaves your heart
First you feel that beat start
bubbling under
Then you hear the tom-toms
Loud as thunder (it's moving me!)
Sounds a lot like being free
When you feel
Feel the jungle rhythm
Feel the jungle rhythm (come on, Shanti!) Can't do without rhythm
And when it fills the air
Animals everywhere
Join in the dance You'll dance along with 'em
Feeling it steal your soul
We'll stomp our paws!
Flap our wings!
Maybe do one or two crazy things Kan Khan!
Yeah that's it!
Uh ha, uh ha! Check out those chat-chat-chattering monkeys
Swinging through the banyan trees
Two by two (two by two)
To the jungle rhythm Sounds like a wolf pack
Way in the distance
Singing pretty harmonies
Woo-woo-woo (woo-woo-woo)
To the jungle rhythm Yeah! That's it! Now you can hightail it out of the jungle
But it never leaves your heart
First you feel that beat start
Bubbling under
Then you hear the tom toms
Loud as thunder (it's moving me!) Sounds a lot like being free
When I feel (When I feel)
(When I feel) (When I feel)
Feel the jungle rhythmmmm (x5) Seven AM, the usual morning line-up
Start on the chores and sweep till the floor's all clean
Polish and wax, do laundry and mop and shine up
Sweep again, and by then, it's like seven fifteen And so I'll read a book, or maybe two or three
I'll add a few new paintings to my gallery
I'll play guitar and knit and cook and basically
Just wonder when will my life begin? Then after lunch, it's puzzles and darts and baking
Paper-mache, a bit of ballet and chess
Pottery and ventriloquy, candle-making
Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch
Take a climb, sew a dress And I'll re-read the books, if I have time to spare
I'll paint the wall some more, I'm sure there's room somewhere
And then I'll brush and brush and brush and brush my hair
Stuck in the same place I've always been
And I'll keep wondering, and wondering, and wondering, and wondering
When will my life begin? Tomorrow night, the lights will appear
Just like they do on my birthday each year
What is it like out there where they glow?
Now that I'm older, mother might just let me go Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
Old Mother Nature's recipes
That brings the bare necessities of life Wherever I wander, wherever I roam
I couldn't be fonder of my big home
The bees are buzzin' in the tree
To make some honey just for me
When you look under the rocks and plants
And take a glance at the fancy ants
Then maybe try a few The bare necessities of life will come to you
They'll come to you! Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
That's why a bear can rest at ease
With just the bare necessities of life Now when you pick a pawpaw
Or a prickly pear
And you prick a raw paw
Well next time beware
Don't pick the prickly pear by the paw
When you pick a pear
Try to use the claw
But you don't need to use the claw
When you pick a pear of the big pawpaw
Have I given you a clue? The bare necessities of life will come to you
They'll come to you! the snow glows white on the mountain tonight not a footprint to be seen
a kingdom of isolation and it looks like i'm the queen
the wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
couldn't keep it in haven't noticed I've tried Don't let them in, don't let them see, be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know well now they know Let it go, let it go, can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go, turn my back and slam the door
And I don't care what they're going to say
Let the storm rage on the cold never bothered me anyway It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can't get to me at all It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free Let it go, let it go, I'm one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go, you'll never see me cry
And here I'll stand, and here I'll stay
Let the storm rage on My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past Let it go, let it go, and I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go, that perfect girl is gone
And here I'll stand, in the light of day
Let the storm rage on, the cold never bothered me anyway I see what's happening here
You're face to face with greatness and it's strange
You don't even know how you feel
It's adorable!
Well, it's nice to see that humans never change
Open your eyes, let's begin
Yes, it's really me
It's Maui, breathe it in
I know its a lot; the hair, the bod
When you're staring at a demigod What can I say except you're welcome
For the tides, the sun, the sky
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome
I'm just an ordinary demi-guy Hey!
What has two thumbs and pulled up the sky
When you were waddling yay high
This guy!
When the nights got cold
Who stole you fire from down below
You're lookin' at him, yo
Oh!
Also I lassoed the sun
(You're welcome)
To stretch your days and bring you fun
Also I harnessed the breeze
(You're welcome!)
To fill your sails and shake your trees So what can I say except you're welcome
For the islands I pulled from the sea
There's no need to pray, it's okay, you're welcome
Ha! I guess it's just my way of being me
You're welcome!
You're welcome! Well, come to think of it
Kid, honestly I could go on and on
I could explain every natural phenomenon
The tide? The grass? The ground?
Oh, that was Maui just messin' around
I killed an eel, I buried its guts
Sprouted a tree, now you've got coconuts
What's the lesson? What is the takeaway?
Don't mess with Maui when he's on the breakaway And the tapestry here on my skin
Is a map of the victories I win
Look where I've been
I make everything happen
Look at that mean mini Maui just tickety-tappin'
Heh, heh, heh ,heh, heh, heh, hey! Well anyway, let me say you're welcome (You're welcome)
For the wonderful world you know
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome (You're welcome)
Well, come to think of it, I gotta go!
Hey, it's your day to say you're welcome (You're welcome)
'Cause I'm gonna need that boat
I'm sailing away, away, you're welcome (You're welcome)
'Cause Maui can do anything but float! (You're welcome)
You're welcome! (You're welcome)
You're welcome! And thank you! You think you own whatever land you land on
The earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know every rock and tree and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name
You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew, you never knew
Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind? Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once, never wonder what they're worth
The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other,
In a circle, in a hoop that never ends
Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or let the eagle tell you where he's been
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind
How high does the sycamore grow?
If you cut it down, then you'll never know
And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper-skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain
Need to paint with all the colors of the wind
You can own the earth and still
All you'll own is earth until
You can paint with all the colors of the wind (Cinderella) So this is love, Mmmmmm
So this is love
So this is what makes life divine
I'm all aglow, Mmmmmm
And now I know
(Prince Charming) And now I know
(Both) The key to all heaven is mine
(Cinderella) My heart has wings, Mmmmmm
And I can fly
(Both) I'll touch every star in the sky
So this is the miracle that I've been dreaming of
Mmmmmm
So this is love M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E

Life under the sea is better than anything they got up there' The seaweed is always greener
In somebody else's lake
You dream about going up there
But that is a big mistake Just look at the world around you
Right here on the ocean floor
Such wonderful things surround you
What more is you lookin' for?
Under the sea, under the sea Darling, it's better
Down where it's wetter
Take it from me
Up on the shore, they work all day Out in the sun, they slave away
While we devotin', full time to floatin'
Under the sea
Down here all the fish is happy
As off through the waves they roll The fish on the land ain't happy
They sad 'cause they in the bowl
But fish in the bowl is lucky
They in for a worser fate
One day when the boss get hungry Guess who's gon' be on the plate
Under the sea, under the sea
Nobody beat us
Fry us and eat us
In fricassee
We, what the land folks loves to cook
Under the sea, we off the We got no troubles Life is the bubbles
Under the sea, under the sea
Since life is sweet here
We got the beat here
Naturally
Even the sturgeon an' the ray
They get the urge an' start to play
We got the spirit, you got to hear it
Under the sea
The newt play the flute
The carp play the harp
The plaice play the bass
And they soundin' sharp
The bass play the brass
The chub play the tub
The fluke is the duke of soul
(Yeah)
The ray he can play
The lings on the strings
The trout, rockin' out
The blackish, she sings
The smelt and the sprat
They know where it's at
An' oh, that blowfish blow
Under the sea, under the sea
When the sardine
Begin the beguine
It's music to me
What do they got? A lot of sand
We got a hot crustacean band
Each little clam here, know how to jam here
Under the sea
Each little slug here, cuttin' a rug here
Under the sea
Each little snail here, know how to wail here
That's why it's hotter, under the water
Ya we in luck here, down in the muck here
Under the sea (Ou mata e matagi)
I have crossed the horizon to find you
(Ou loto mamaina toa)
I know your name
(Manatu atu)
They have stolen the heart from inside you
(Taku pelepele)
But this does not define you
(Manatu atu)
This is not who you are
You know who you are I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide? I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us "No"
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But now from way up here
It's crystal clear
that now I'm in a whole new world with you Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky A whole new world
Don't you dare close your eyes
A hundred thousand things to see
Hold your breath - it gets better
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be A whole new world
Every turn a surprise
With new horizons to pursue
Every moment gets better
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you A whole new world (A whole new world)
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us "No"
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming
A whole new world
Every turn a surprise
With new horizons to pursue
Every moment, red letter
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you A whole new world
A whole new world
That's where we'll be
That's where we'll be
A thrilling chase
A wondrous place
For you and me John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt
His name is my name too
Whenever I go out
The people always shout,
"There goes John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt!"
Nanananananana What i love most about rivers is:
you can't step in the same river twice
the water's always changing, always flowing
but people, i guess, can't live like that
we all must pay a price
to be safe, we lose our chance of ever knowing
what's around the riverbend
waiting just around the riverbend
I look once more
just around the riverbend
beyond the shore
where the gulls fly free
don't know what for
what i dream the day might send
jut around the riverbend
for me
coming for me
I feel it there beyond those trees
or right behind these waterfalls
can i ignore that sound of distant drumming
for a handsome sturdy husband
who builds handsome sturdy walls
and never dreams that something might be coming?
just around the riverbend
just around the riverbend
I look once more
just around the riverbend
beyond the shore
somewhere past the sea
don't know what for ...
why do all my dreams extend
just around the riverbend?
just around the riverbend ...
Should i choose the smoothest course
steady as the beating drum?
should i marry kocoum?
is all my dreaming at an end?
or do you still wait for me, dream giver
just around the riverbend? It's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough, you'll always sound precocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious Um diddle, diddle diddle, um diddle ay
Um diddle, diddle diddle, um diddle ay
Um diddle, diddle diddle, um diddle ay
Um diddle, diddle diddle, um diddle ay Because I was afraid to speak
When I was just a lad
My father gave me nose a tweak
And told me I was bad But then one day I learned a word
That saved me achin' nose
The biggest word I ever heard
And this is how it goes, oh Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough, you'll always sound precocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious Um diddle, diddle diddle, um diddle ay
Um diddle, diddle diddle, um diddle ay
Um diddle, diddle diddle, um diddle ay
Um diddle, diddle diddle, um diddle ay He traveled all around the world
And everywhere he went
He'd use his word and all would say
There goes a clever gent When Dukes and Maharajahs
Pass the time of day with me
I say me special word
And then they ask me out to tea Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough, you'll always sound precocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious Um diddle, diddle diddle, um diddle ay
Um diddle, diddle diddle, um diddle ay No, you can say it backwards, which is dociousaliexpilisticfragicalirupus
But that's going a bit too far, don't you think? So when the cat has got your tongue
There's no need for dismay
Just summon up this word
And then you've got a lot to say But better use it carefully
Or it could change your life
For example, yes, one night I said it to me girl
And now me girl's my wife, oh, and a lovely thing she's too She's, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious I'm gonna be a mighty king
So enemies beware
Well, I've never seen a king of beasts
With quite so little hair I'm gonna be the main event
Like no king was before
I'm brushing up on looking down
I'm working on my roar Thus far, a rather uninspiring thing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king
You've rather a long way to go, young master, if you think- No one saying, "do this"
Now when I said that, I
No one saying, "be there"
What I meant was No one saying, "stop that"
Look, what you don't realize
No one saying, "see here"
Now see here! Free to run around all day
Well, that's definitely out
Free to do it all my way I think it's time that you and I
Arranged a heart to heart
Kings don't need advice
From little horn-bills for a start If this is where the monarchy is headed
Count me out
Out of service, out of Africa
I wouldn't hang about This child is getting wildly out of wing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king Everybody look left
Everybody look right
Everywhere you look I'm
Standin' in the spotlight
Not yet! Let every creature go for broke and sing
Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing
It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling Oh, I just can't wait to be king
Oh, I just can't wait to be king
Oh, I just can't wait to be king la belle la belle
bonjour bonjour
le merchant et prince Open up your eyes take a look at me
If the picture fits in your memory
I've been dreamin by the rythym like the beat of a heart
And i won't stop until I start to stand out Some people settle for the typical thing
Livin' all their lives waitin' in the wings
It ain't a question of 'if', just a matter of time
Before I move to the front of the line And once you're watchin' ev'ry move that I make
Ya gotta believe that I got what it takes (Chorus)
To stand out
Above the crowd
Even if I gotta shout out loud
'Til mine is the only face you see
Gonna stand out 'til you notice me If the squeaky wheels always gettin the greese
I'm totally devoted to disturbin the peace
And I'll do it all again, when I get it done
Until I become your number one No method to the madness and means of escape
Gonna break every rule I'll bend them all out of shape
It ain't a question of 'how' just a matter of when
You get the message that I'm tryin to send I'm under a spell, I'm in over my head
And you kno I'm going all of the way, till the end To stand out
Above the crowd
Even if I gotta shout out loud
'Til mine is the only face you see
Gonna stand out 'til you notice me, yeah If I could make you stop and take a look at me instead of just
Walkin' by
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do
If it was gettin' you to notice
I'm alive All I need is half a chance, a second thought, a second glance'll prove
I got whatever it takes
It's a piece of cake To stand out
Above the crowd
Even if I gotta shout out loud
'Til mine is the only face you see
Gonna stand out
Stand out, hey
Stand out!
(Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
Stand out!
(Hmph!)
'Til mine's the only face you see
Gonna stand out
'Til you notice me Ke manatua

Soaring, flying, there's not a star in heaven that we can't reach,
[Gabriella]
If we're trying, so we're breaking free,
[Troy]
You know the world can see us, in a way, that's different than who we are,
[Gabriella]
Creating space between us, till we're separate hearts,
[Together]
But your faith, it gives me strength, strength to believe.
[Troy]
We're breaking free!
[Gabriella]
We're soaring,
[Troy]
Flying,

Can you feel the building, like a wave the ocean just can't control,

Convicted by a feeling, in our very soul,

So everyone can see,
We're breaking free.

[Together]
To be all that we can be.
[Troy]
Now's the time,
[Together]
So, we're breaking,
[Troy]
We're breaking free (Gabriella: Ohhhh yeahhh)
[Troy]
More than hope, more than faith,
[Gabriella]
This is true, this is me
And together, we see it coming,
[Troy]
More than you,
More than me,
[Gabriella]
Not alone, but I need,
[Together]
Both of us, breaking free.
[Gabriella]
Soaring,
[Troy]
Flying,
[Together]
There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach,
If we're trying,
Yeah, we're breaking free.
[Gabriella]
We're running,

Oh Climbing,

To get to the place,
To be all that we can be.
Now's the time, (now's the time)

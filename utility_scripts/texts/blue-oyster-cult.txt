All our times have come
Here, but now they're gone
Seasons don't fear the reaper
Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain
(We can be like they are)
Come on baby
(Don't fear the reaper)
Baby take my hand
(Don't fear the reaper)
We'll be able to fly (Don't fear the reaper)
Baby I'm your man
La, la la, la la
La, la la, la la
Valentine is done
Here but now they're gone
Romeo and Juliet
Are together in eternity
(Romeo and Juliet)
40, 000 men and women every day
(Like Romeo and Juliet)
40, 000 men and women every day
(Redefine happiness)
Another 40, 000 coming every day
(We can be like they are)
Come on baby
(Don't fear the reaper)
Baby take my hand
(Don't fear the reaper)
We'll be able to fly
(Don't fear the reaper)
Baby I'm your man
La, la la, la la
La, la la, la la
Love of two is one
Here but now they're gone
Came the last night of sadness
And it was clear she couldn't go on
Then the door was open and the wind appeared
The candles blew and then disappeared
The curtains flew and then he appeared
(Saying, "Don't be afraid")
Come on baby
(And she had no fear)
And she ran to him
(Then they started to fly)
They looked backward and said goodbye
(She had become like they are)
She had taken his hand
(She had become like they are)
Come on baby
(Don't fear the reaper) In the garden district
Where the plants grow strong and tall
Behind the bush there lurks a girl
Who makes them strong and tall
The villagers call her
Quicklime girl... behind her back
Quicklime girl... behind the bush
Quicklime girl
She's the mistress of the salmon salt
Quicklime girl
Quicklime girl
Quicklime girl In the fall when plants return
By harvest time she knows the score
Ripe and ready to the eye
Yet rotten somehow to the core
And they call her
Quicklime girl... behind her back
Quicklime girl... behind the bush
Quicklime girl
She's the mistress of the salmon salt
Quicklime girl
Quicklime girl
Quicklime girl A harvest of life a harvest of death
One body of life one body of death
And when you've gone and choked to death
With laughter and a little step 
I'll prepare the quicklime, friend
For your ripe and ready grave
For your ripe and ready grave It's springtime now and cares subside
And the planning's almost done
And fertile graves it seems exist
Within a mile of that duke's joint
Where coast guard crews still take their leave
Quite listless in the sun
And the quicklime girl still plies her trade
The reduction of the many from the one
And they call her
Quicklime girl... behind her back
Quicklime girl... behind the bush
Quicklime girl
She's the mistress of the salmon salt
Quicklime girl
Quicklime girl... they call her
Quicklime girl A harvest of life, a harvest of death
Resumes it's course each day
It comes as if by schedule
A harvester lifts his arms to the rain
And toes that crawl
And knees that jerk
And necks like swans that seem to turn
As if inclined to gasp or pray With a purposeful grimace and a terrible sound
He pulls the spitting high tension wires down Helpless people on a subway train
Scream bug-eyed as he looks in on them He picks up a bus and he throws it back down
As he wades through the buildings toward the center of town Oh no, they say, he's got to go
Go go Godzilla, yeah
Oh no, there goes Tokyo
Go go Godzilla, yeah Oh no, they say he's got to go Go go Godzilla, yeah Oh no, there goes Tokyo

I've been living on the edge so long
Where the winds of limbo roar
And I'm young enough to look at
And far too old to see
All the scars are on the inside I'm not sure if there's anything left of me Don't let these shakes go on
It's time we had a break from it
It's time we had some leave
We've been living in the flames
We've been eating up our brains
Oh, please, don't let these shakes go on You ask me why I'm weary
Why I can't speak to you
You blame me for my silence
Say it's time I changed and grew
But the war's still going on, dear
And there's no end that I know
And I can't say I'm forever I can't say if we're ever gonna be free Don't let these shakes go on
It's time we had a break from it
It's time we had some leave
We've been living in the flames
We've been eating up our brains
Oh, please, don't let these shakes go on You see me now a veteran
Of a thousand psychic wars
My energy's spent at last
And my armor is destroyed
I have used up all my weapons
And I'm helpless and bereaved
Wounds are all I'm made of Did I hear you say that this is victory? Don't let these shakes go on
It's time we had a break from it
Send me to the rear
Where the tides of madness swell
And been sliding into Hell
Oh, please, don't let these shakes go on
Don't let these shakes go on
Don't let these shakes go on I plot your rubric scarab,
I steal your satellite
I want your wife to be my
Baby tonight, baby tonight I choose to steal what you chose to show
And you know I will not apologize
You're mine for the taking
I'm making a career of evil Pay me I'll be your surgeon
I'd like to pick your brain
Capture you inject you
Leave you kneeling in the rain
Kneeling in the rain I choose to steal what you chose to show
And you know I will not apologize
You're mine for the taking
I'm making a career of evil I'd like your blue eyed horseshoe,
I'd like your emerald horny toad
I'd like to do it to your daughter on a dirt road And then I'd spend your ransom money,
But still I'd keep your sheep
I'd peel the mask you're wearing,
And then rob you of your sleep
Rob you of your sleep I choose to steal what you chose to show
And you know I will not apologize
You're mine for the taking
I'm making a career of evil Well I bumped inside the magic man
And he laid some tricks on me
He said, "You do need help my friend"
I whispered... "Obviously"
He laid a spread of Jacks and Queens
And he bade me take my pick
But every face it had your face
I cried out, "I am sick" Sick of hauling your love around
Want to run my train alone
But the engine tracks straight through your heart
And weighs me like a stone Oh, it's a hard load to love you
It takes up all my time, having you
So familiar
Like last life's
Nursery rhyme So I gave away the pictures
And your golden ring
And the phone calls you sent me
And the silver birds that sing
Then the man he told me something
That really brought me down
Your things were thrown away, it's true
But you were still in town Sick of hauling your love around
Wanna run my train alone
But the engine tracks straight through your heart
And weighs me like a stone Oh, it's a hard load to love you
It takes up all my time, having you
So familiar
Like last life's
Nursery rhyme The magician left a message
It flashes when I hide
Accept the chains of loving
Accept or else remove yourself from her side
And do without her love
And I lay back with a steel chain
I keep it by my side
I could mail a letter to you but I still
Have my pride Sick of hauling your love around
Wanna run my train alone
But the engine tracks straight through your heart
And weighs me like a stone Three times I've sent you back from me
Three times my bones gone dry
And three times I've seen the shooting shark
Lighting up the sky Oh, it's a hard load to love you, babe
It takes my breath away
The fourth time round
Is the last time round
There's nothing else to say. Clock strikes twelve and moon drops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Like acid and oil on a madman's face
His reason tends to fly away
Like lesser birds on the four winds Like silver scrapes in May
And now the sand's become a crust Most of you have gone away, you have gone away
Oh, come Susie, dear, let's take a walk
Just out there upon the beach
I know you'll soon be married
And you'll want to know where winds come from
Well it's never said at all
On the map that Carrie reads
Behind the clock back there you know At the Four Winds Bar
Hey, hey, Hey, hey Four winds at the Four Winds Bar
Two doors locked and windows barred One door to let to take you in
The other one just mirrors it
Hey, hey, Hey, hey Uh, hellish glare and inference
The other one's a duplicate
The queenly flux, eternal light
Or the light that never warms Yes, the light that never, never warms
Oh, the light that never
Never warms
Never warms
Never warms
The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Miss Carrie nurse and Susie dear Would find themselves at Four Winds Bar It's the nexus of the crisis
And the origin of storms Just the place to hopelessly Encounter time and then came me...
Hey, hey, Hey, hey
Hey, hey, Hey, hey
Call me Desdinova
Eternal light
These gravely digs of mine
Will surely prove a sight
And don't forget my dog
Fixed and consequent
Astronomy... a star...

I'm totally bent in the big time
There's no place for one of my kind
Scorn behind shades I don't care anyway Celestial the Queen
Celestial the Queen
Celestial the Queen Her world turns around
In my ears the sound of laughter
Swift descent
Dark and mute dreams deceive Her world turns around me
Celestial the Queen
Celestial the Queen She came from the dark she came from a dream
All leather and chain the rising Queen
Born into the night born into the spotlight
She spread her wings and then she was gone Celestial the Queen

In my head the fairy laughter
Swift ascent and then forever
It meant nothing The world turns around me

Give rise to self love or self pity
The prize if a woman is pretty
She tries like a superstar Hollywood girl Pretty girls can't look away

Tears of god flow as I bleed So ladies fish and gentlemen
Here's my angled dream
See me in the blue sky bag
And meet me by the sea Oyster boys are
Swimming for me now

Hear them chatter on the tide
We understand, we understand
But fear is real and so do I So ladies fish and gentlemen
Here's my angled dream
See me in the blue sky bag

Swimming for me
Just one deal is what
We made now Forest keys and whirlwind cold
Green keys too and keys of gold

When the skies become a scroll So ladies fish and gentlemen
Here's my angled dream
See me in the blue sky bag
And meet me by the sea Junkies down in Brooklyn are going crazy

Policemen are hiding behind the skirts of little girls
Their eyes have turned the color of frozen meat No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no-no, no, no, no

They gave that land a go
They built a thriving business
Then came that early snow
They lost their livestock that year
They lost their sheep and goats
They sold the farm in springtime
Went south to work the boats Ahh ahh ahh ahh When the wind turns

Young people feelin' restless
Old people feelin' old Harvest moon Perfect water.
The dark wind braids the waves.
The crazed birds raid the trees. Is this our destiny?
To join our hands at sea - and slowly sink, and slowly think:
This is perfect water, passing over me. Do you know Jacques Cousteau when they said on the radio
That he hears bells in random order, deep beneath the perfect water?
Lord, that is frightening, but still so inviting.
To drown inside a sound that lay so far underground.
And to think... And to think:
This is perfect water, passing over me. To flow inside the spiral tide
To drop my eyes like a bride and ride
Across the curl unmarked by borders
It waits for me like an orphaned daughter
A life of perfect order! A strange and perfect water!
A life of perfect order! A strange and perfect water! Perfect water.
I dream this dream within my deep and warm Gulf Stream.
Where two blocks of ice melt into my hands like dice,
And I roll (seven) a seven on the floor of the sea! (seven)
And I roll (seven) a seven on the floor of the sea! (seven)
And I feel the perfect water, washing over me. To flow inside the spiral tide
To drop my eyes like a bride and ride
Across the curl unmarked by borders
It waits for me like an orphaned daughter
A life of perfect order! A strange and perfect water!
A life of perfect order! A strange and perfect water!
A life! A strange!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, ready, are you
(Ready to rock)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Ready to rock) Strange shapes light up the night
Never seen them though I hope I might
Don't ask if they are real
The men in black, their lips are sealed Fantasy it fills my mind
To leave this place before my time
Release myself from earthly care
My dream may be your nightmare I turn my hopes up to the sky
I'd like to know before I die
Memories will slowly fade
I lift my eyes and say
Come on, take me away
Come on, take me away Come here, girl, close to me
A thousand stars your eye can see
First star we see tonight
I wish I may I wish I might I turn my hopes up to the sky
I'd like to know before I die
Memories will slowly fade
I lift my eyes and say
Come on, take me away
Come on, take me away I turn my hopes up to the sky
I'd like to know before I die
Memories will slowly fade
I lift my eyes and say
Come on, take me away
I lift my eyes and say
Come on, take me away
I lift my eyes and say
Come on, take me away
I lift my eyes and say
Come on, take me away
I lift my eyes and say
Come on, take me away All our times have come
Here, but now there, gone
Seasons don't fear the reaper
Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain
(We can be like they are) Come on baby
(Don't fear the reaper)
Baby take my hand
(Don't fear the reaper)
We'll be able to fly
(Don't fear the reaper)
Baby I'm your man La, la la, la la
La, la la, la la Valentine is done
Here but now they're gone
Romeo and Juliet
Are together in eternity
(Romeo and Juliet) 40, 000 men and women every day
(Like Romeo and Juliet)
40, 000 men and women every day
(Redefine happiness)
Another 40, 000 coming every day
(We can be like they are) Come on baby
(Don't fear the reaper)
Baby take my hand
(Don't fear the reaper)
We'll be able to fly
(Don't fear the reaper)
Baby I'm your man La, la la, la la
La, la la, la la Love of two is one
Here but now they're gone Came the last night of sadness
And it was clear she couldn't go on
Then the door was open and the wind appeared
The candles blew and then disappeared
The curtains flew and then he appeared
(Saying, "Don't be afraid") Come on baby
(And she had no fear)
And she ran to him
(Then they started to fly)
They looked backward and said goodbye
(She had become like they are)
She had taken his hand
(She had become like they are) Come on baby
(Don't fear the reaper) Goering's on the phone to Freiburg
Say's Willie's done quite a job
Hitler's on the phone from Berlin
Say's I'm gonna make you a star My Captain Von Ondine, here's your next patrol
A flight of English bombers across the canal
After twelve, they'll all be here
I think you know the job They hung there dependant from the sky
Like some heavy metal fruit
These bombers, ripened, ready to tilt
Must these Englishmen live that I might die
Must they live that I might die In a G-load disaster from the rate of climb
Sometimes I'd faint and be lost to our side
But there's no reward for failure, but death
So watch me in the mirrors, keep in the glidepath Get me through these radars, no I cannot fail
Not when great silver slugs are eager to feed
I can't fail, no not now
When twenty five bombers wait ripe They hung there dependant from the sky
Like some heavy metal fruit
These bombers, ripened, ready to tilt
Must these Englishmen live that I might die
Must they live that I might die Me-262 prince of turbojet, Junkers jumo 004
Blasts from clustered R4M quartets in my snout
And see these English planes go burn
Now you be my witness how red were the skies
When the fortresses flow, for the very last time
It was dark over Westphalia, in april of 45 They hung there dependant from the sky
Like some heavy metal fruit
These bombers, ripened, ready to tilt
Must these Englishmen live that I might die
Must they live that I might die Must these Englishmen live that I might die
Junker.s jommo 004 (repeat many times)
Bombers at 12 o'clock high That night her kiss told me it was over
I walked out late into the dark
The misty gloom seems to soak up my sorrow
The further I went on
I felt a spreading calm
Then suddenly my eyes were bathed in light
And the lovely lady in white was by my side
She said "Like me I see you're walking alone
Won't you please stay?"
I couldn't look away She said
I love the night
The day is OK and the sun can be fun but I live
To see those rays slip away
I love the night
There's so much I can show and give to you
If you will welcome me tonight If only you had been there my dear
We could have shared this together No mortal was meant to know such wonder
One look in the mirror told me so
Come darkness I'll see her again
Yes I'm gonna go
'Cause now I know I love the night
The day is OK and the sun can be fun but I live
To see those rays slip away I love the night
I love the night
I love the night (Raise your can of beer on high)
(And seal your fate forever)
(Our best years have past us by)
(The golden age of leather) This was the night, not long to come
In the year of our Lord A.D.
Where in a desert way-house
Poised on the brink of eternity
Four and ninety studded horsemen closed the knot of honor
As only drunken soldiers can And passed from man to man
A wanton child, too dead to care
That each would find his pleasure as he might
For this fantastic night was billed
As nothing less than the end of an age
A last crusade, a final outrage
In this day of flaccid plumage And there was worn no cloth but leather
Made supple by years of stinging cinders
And here were seen the scars of age
For age had been the common call for one last night together (Dawn colored the sky) the ritual ceased
(Some had died) they were buried with their bikes
(Each grabbed a rag) from a man with a sack
(Torn strips of color) the red and the black I came here willingly
And I will go down valiantly
(We made a vow) to give it all we had to give
(We made a vow) to die as we had lived They flew the colors, they began to fight
They flailed at each other like bugs at a light
Bodies and bikes beyond repair
The smell of oil and gas in the air Then the wind whipped the desert with a giant hand
And the humans and the Harleys caught the shifting sand
The old ranger weathered the storm
And he topped the rise by the middle of morn
He saw rippled dunes, calm and surreal
And a glint of a solitary shaft of chromium steel (Gold) (golden age)
(Gold) (golden age)
(Gold) (golden age)
(Gold) (golden age)
(Gold) (golden age)
(Gold) (golden age) Canadian Mounted, baby
Police force that works
Red and Black
It's their color scheme
Get their man
In the end
It's all right
Yeah, it's all right Frontenac Chateau, baby
I cross the frontier at ten
Got a whip in my hand, baby
And a girl or a husky
At leather's end
It's all right
Yeah, it's all right baby

Yeah, my lovely bel punice
You know you, you kill and you maim
The husky know Mush you huskies-ride mush you huskies-ride mush you huskies

Ride mush you huskies-ride mush you huskies Hornswoop me bungo pony on dogsled on ice
Make a dash for freedom, baby
Don't skate on polar ice
It's too thick to be sliced
By the light
Of long and white polar nights
It's all right
It's all right
Yeah, my lovely bel punice
You know you, you kill and you maim Ah, here they come now, yeah
C'mon ride! Oh yeah I spent ten years, half my life
Just getting ready, then it was time
Warpage in my figures, radios appear
Midnight was the barrier, back in 1963 Each night the covers were unfolded
Each night it's susie's turn to ride
While charles, the one they call her brother
Covers on his eyes
Murmurs in the background
It will be time Oh yeah Susan and her brother, charles the grinning boy
Put me in the backseat, and they took me for a ride
Yeah, the radio was on - can't you dig the locomotion
Kingdoms of the radio, 45 rpm
Too much revolution, then Each night the covers were unfolded
Each night it's susie's turn to ride
While charles, the one they call her brother
Covers on his eyes
Murmurs in the background
It will be time It's past midnight said charles the grinning boy
And looking at me greedily, said it's 1964 In times square now people do the polka
Dominance submission radios appear
This new year's eve was the final barrier
Dominance submission radios appear
We took you up and we put you in the back seat
Dominance submission radios appear
From year to year we looked out for the venture
Dominance submission radios appear
Dominance submission Bleached by the Sun
And scorched by the Moon
If I make it 'til tomorrow noon I'm leaving
'Tween the horror of space
And the terror of time
My heart is crystal, down the line I'm screaming CHORUS
What I need is a kiss from you, babe
Before it's hangover time
What I need is some love from you, babe
Before this stampede arrives Desolate landscape
Storybook bliss
My darling let me tell you this, it's crazy
Hell of a memory
Is a heaven of pain
Snow is cold but so is rain, please, save me CHORUS Oh, babe (what I need kiss from you, babe)
Before it's hangover time (what I need love from you, babe)
Before this stampede arrives Babe (what I need, Death Valley nights)
Babe, babe (what I need, Death Valley nights)
Babe (what I need)
I need you (Death Valley nights)
Before I lose my mind (What I need) I need you (Death Valley nights)
(What I need) to run away (Death Valley nights) get away
(What I need) outer space (Death Valley nights) just run away
(What I need) I need you (Death Valley nights) Maybe I'll see you again baby
And maybe I won't
Maybe you've bought your ticket
Gone back to Detroit
Airplanes make strangers of us all
Give us distance
Much too easily. Jim says some destinies
Should not be delivered
But you and I seen now baby
That still they are
Winning it makes losers of us all
'Cause the dice roll
So indifferently. CHORUS:
Well, I'll wrap myself in cities I travel
I'll wrap myself in dreams
I'll wrap myself in solitude
("stranger's arms" FOR 3RD CHORUS)
But I wish I could wrap myself
In thee. Tonight it's hot, without you
Tomorrow'll be cold
Winter will come along
Driven by snow
Love it makes strangers of us all
When we part
Oh so thoughtlessly CHORUS Once we breathed the breath
Of sweet surrender
Pure, pure Arab air filled our
Atmosphere
But pride it makes stars of us all
Until we fall
For everyone to see. CHORUS
CHORUS I've lived upon
The edge of chance
For twenty years or more
And this is what my friends all mean By Del Rio's song... Oh, Del Rio
Del Rio's Song... Oh, Del Rio
Del Rio's Song... Oh, Del Rio
Del Rio's Song... Oh, Del Rio When time gets slow, and rivers freeze
I think you'd know enough To call in touch that outer frame
The inner gain, a sullen gulch
Which opens up on the way to Blindman's Bluff A suburb now of River Roads
Where quandry and sublime improve
The sight whose imagery
Is sometimes that of fear I've lived upon
The edge of chance
For twenty years or more
And this is what my friends all mean By Del Rio's song... Oh, Del Rio
Del Rio's Song... Oh, Del Rio
Del Rio's Song... Oh, Del Rio
Del Rio's Song... Oh, Del Rio When time gets slow, and rivers freeze
I think you'd know enough To shut the gates of walled town walls
And putting up some good rum punch
Forget the way to Blindman's Bluff So packed with eyes
That glow like coals
And pointing towards the North
Oh my boat left New Orleans in 1829! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! My destination is a secret
And the doctrine is soft
And just between the verse and me
It's a place where you can see
Lost, last and luminous
Scored to sky yet never found
Relics of jewels
And ant-track tools
A true ghost dance
Rehearsal Ground I've lived upon
The edge of chance
For twenty years or more
And this is what my friends all mean I've lived upon
The edge of chance
For twenty years or more
And this is what my friends all mean By Del Rio's song... Oh, Del Rio
Del Rio's Song... Oh, Del Rio
Del Rio's Song... Oh, Del Rio
Del Rio's Song... Oh, Del Rio Parched land no desert sand, sun was just a dot
And a little bit of water goes a long way, 'cause it's hot
Three good buddies were laughing and smoking in the back
Of a rented ford
They couldn't know they weren't going far Each one with the money in his pocket
Could go out and buy himself a brand new car
But they all had the money they had
Money they hoped would take them very far The sky was bright, a traffic light, now and then a truck
And they hadn't seen a cop around all day
They brought everything they needed
Bags and scales to weigh the stuff
The driver said the border's just over the bluff It wasn't until the car suddenly stopped
In the middle of a cold and barren place
And the other guy turned and spilled
Three boys blood, did they know a trap had been lain?  They're ok the last days of may, I'll be breathing dry air
I'm leaving soon, the others are already there
You wouldn't be interested in coming along, instead of staying here
They say the west is nice this time of year You scorned the love that I gave you
You lied now nothing can save you
Blue skies are turning to grey
I know the games that you play
Winds of rage they start to build
Too much madness will lay you under
The cards you draw don't help at all
Hear the sound of approaching thunder When you see the clouds blacken
Remember you've been warned
No shelter from my fierce winds
Because, I am the storm You'll hear my echoes of anger
You'll fear the roar of my thunder
Nightmares, confusion will come true
Aces and eights are the fate that you drew
Lightning bolts become my swords
When I pull them from the sky
Run my gauntlet of slashing rain
You won't survive to testify When you see the clouds blacken
Remember you've been warned
No shelter from my fierce winds
Because, I am the storm Ooo cagey - what you got?
What you got there dummy?
What you got there man?
Ooo cagey - what you got?
What you got there honey?
What is it, a worm? Dumb clouds are raging
Stupid clouds at my door
Creepy weather coming
Coming 'round my floor
Dumb clouds stay away
Don't come back no more Ooo cagey - what you got?
Got an awful tummy,
Oh no it's inflamed
Ooo cagey - what you got?
It's so lonely honey
In the state of Maine Dumb clouds are raging
Stupid clouds at my door
Creepy weather coming
Coming 'round my floor
Dumb clouds stay away
Don't come back no more I'm graduating in one more term
Because I haven't any time to burn
Repeating taste of high-heeled shoe
An eel is waiting under the train Being chased around by the neighbor's cat
Well it's so lonely in the state of Maine Dumb clouds are ringing
Ringing in my ear
Mother's wombs are crying
Ringing in my fear
Mothers never run
Except when rape is near Ooo cagey By silverfish imperetrix, whose incorrupted eye
Sees through the charms of doctors and their wives
By salamander, drake, and the power that was undine
Rise to claim Saturn, ring and sky
By those who see with their eyes close
They know me by my black telescope Your green tree mantle from which these things derive
A lens of quartz and refract spoke that crystal lens
Whose crystal rope once bound me to those
Doctors and wives When my vision was oh, so cloudy
And I saw things through two eyes
I am a sailor on the raging depths
And I know a thing or two
Back to the corner mates and over the side
Yes I know a thing or two By silverfish imperetrix, whose incorrupted eye
Sees through the charms of doctors and their wives
By salamander, drake, and the power that was undine
Rise to claim Saturn, ring and sky
By those who see with their eyes closed
you'll know me by my black telescope Before my great conversion when the ridge was closed
Before my visit to the workshop of telescopes By silverfish imperetrix, whose incorrupted eye
sees through the charms of doctors and their wives
By salamander, drake, and the power that was undine
Rise to claim Saturn, ring and sky
By those who see with their eyes closed
you'll know me by my black telescope You can have my autograph
I think I'll sign it love to you
But should I sign it just for you Stairway to the stars, I think I'll write good health to you
Stairway to the stars, we got better things to do You can drive my motorcar
It's insured to thirty thou
Kill them all if you wish Stairway to the stars, I think I'll write good health to you
Stairway to the stars, we got better things to do You can have my autograph
I think I'll sign it good health to you
Upon the cast, your broken arm Stairway to the stars, I think I'll write good health to you
Stairway to the stars, I hope you heal up real quick
Stairway to the stars... Come on, let's get on outa here. Well I've opened up my veins too many times
And the poison's in my heart and in my mind
Poison's in my bloodstream, poison's in my pride
I'm after rebellion, I'll settle for lies Is it any wonder that my mind's on fire
Imprisoned by the thoughts of what to do
Is it any wonder that my joke's an iron
And the joke's on you Experiments that failed too many times
Transformations that were too hard to find
Poison's in my bloodstream, poison's in my pride
I'm after rebellion, I'll settle for lies Yes, I know the secrets of the iron and mind
They're trinity acts, a mineral fire
Yes, I know the secrets of the circuitry mind
It's a flaming wonder telepath Well I've opened up my veins too many times
And the poison's in my heart and in my mind
Poison's in my bloodstream, poison's in my pride
I'm after rebellion, I'll settle for lies Is it any wonder that my mind's on fire
Imprisoned by the thoughts of what to do
Is it any wonder that my joke's an iron
And the joke's on you And the joke's on you I... I have no church or philosophy.
I've never known or told a joke you see.
I smoke in bed. I smoke instead.
I know the ins and outs of smoke. And where there's smoke, there's fire,
The flip side of desire.
And if it's true, it can't be you,
It might as well be me.
A spy in the house of your fire
A fire in the house of your night.
A white-hot dark-black rendezvous.
I'll see you there tonight! (tonight, tonight, tonight)
I'll see you there tonight! (tonight, tonight, tonight) I've never been to Spain nor to Germany.
I'll never know my way around the city of Gorky.
I've made love in halls. I fell in love in malls.
I'd love to love you in the dark. And when it's dark, it's night,
The flip side of delight.
So if, in fact, it can't be wrong,
Well then it must be right.
A spy in the house of your fire
A fire in the house of your night.
A white-hot dark-black rendezvous.
I'll see you there tonight! (tonight, tonight, tonight)
I'll see you there tonight! (tonight, tonight, tonight) And when it's dark, it's night,
The flip side of delight.
So if, in fact, it can't be wrong,
Well then it must be right.
A spy in the house of your fire
A fire in the house of your night.
A white-hot dark-black rendezvous.
I'll see you there tonight! (tonight, tonight, tonight)
I'll see you there tonight! (tonight, tonight, tonight)
I'll see you there tonight! Slicing throught the night
Three riders came
Perched on American steel
Riders with no name
Even time cannot reveal
Riders with no name On October 31st many years ago
Three friends went out for a ride
For it was a famous party night
And to party was to get high
They loaded up on beer and cocaine
Then they started their bikes with a roar
They couldn't have known that on that night
They were beginning their longest tour Feel the thunder
Of the midnight ride
Earth torn asunder
By those who died Onto their favorite road they rode
Leather horsemen riding three wide
Their metal beasts howled in the night
A dark spectre was their guide
They came around a curve too fast
Only time for a scream
A fiery crash of chrome and steel
Was the beginning of their longest dream Feel the thunder
Of the midnight ride
Earth torn asunder
By those who died Feel the thunder
Of the midnight ride
Earth torn asunder
By those who died And the fates decreed on that night
Their souls must be tried
Now you can hear them every All Hallows Eve
Forever doomed to ride Slicing throught the night
Three riders came
Perched on American steel
Riders with no name
Even time cannot reveal
Riders with no name Feel the thunder
Of the midnight ride
Earth torn asunder
By those who died I come to you in a blue blue room
By some abuse and some heart
You raise the blinds say, "Let's have light on life,
Let's watch it fall apart. Let's watch it fall apart." Night time flowers, evening roses
Bless this garden that never closes
Treat her gently, treat her kind
Tenderloin will last all night I'm feeling hungry, have another line
So faith is taken up
You raise your eyes say, "That's just like life
There's never quite enough. There's just never quite enough." Night time flowers, evening roses
Bless this garden that never closes
Treat her gently, treat her kind
Tenderloin will last all night I come to you in a blue blue room
By some abuse and some heart
You raise the blinds say, "Let's have light on life,
Let's watch it fall apart. Let's watch it fall apart." I went down last night with a tattoo madame
to a nude dagger fantasy domain
wrapped in hell, i lost my breath... whoa!

Waiting for the kill
On wings of fear the terror sweeps
Into the city beat To defend
This is the pact
But when life's scorned
And damage done
To avenge
This is the pact On wings of vengeance
Taarna finds them
Death for barbarians To defend
This is the pact
But when life's scorned
And damage done
To avenge
This is the pact Flying over the oasis
She is captured
And they pull her down Feeling pain (ah)
From the air (ah)
Close my eyes (ah)
And I am there (ah)
I feel I'm falling down in a deep dark pit "Pull him down," the soldier said
"I'll put an arrow in his head"
But the bird flew off instead
To save his master, on his back she fled
Her time has come Riding her bird high in the saddle
She gets her chance to fulfill the pact now
As their leader swoops from the clouds
She sticks him with her sword then she throws him down The enemy shrivel and die
The enemy shrivel and die
To defend
This is the pact
But when life's scorned
And damage done
To avenge
This is the pact There was no light shining through the window
As Margaret lie in bed
She was wearing cotton pajamas
A crucifix above her head
She awoke from a dream
Her eyes were open
Her lips were moving
In the dark Speak to me in many voices
Make them all sound like one
Let me see your sacred mysteries
Reveal to me the unknown tongue
Reveal to me the unknown tongue She put her hands upon her breasts
And they were small and hard and young
And everywhere she touched she felt a fire
Waiting for the answer that must surely come
Is this the way to love?
Or is this just the way to die? Speak to me in many voices
Make them all sound like one
Let me see your sacred mysteries
Reveal to me the unknown tongue
Reveal to me the unknown tongue Then she took her father's razor
And watched it cut into her palm
She put her hand up to her mouth
To taste the blood so holy and warm
She got up in the morning
Put on her dress, and patent leather shoes
Ate her cereal and kissed her mother
Caught the bus and went to school Speak to me in many voices
Make them all sound like one
Let me see your sacred mysteries
Reveal to me the unknown tongue
Reveal to me the unknown tongue Are you ready, Steve? Aha.
Andy? Yeah! Mick? OK.

To hide herself from his grasp
He went down to the water to find her
To consummate their love at last Then the lightning flashing
(Lightning, flashing, crashing)
Fireworks shooting off in her head
(In her head)
The earth was shaking
(Earth, shaking, quaking) Fireworks pouring down on her head
(On her head)
Only sound she heard was
(Sound, lovely word)
Fireworks like a charm
(Anointed)
Blazing red She went down to escape from her prison
To free herself from her fear
All those years up to here with tradition
And opportunity so near Then the lightning flashing

Only sound she heard was
(Sound, lovely word)
Fireworks like a charm
(Anointed) In a purple vision
Many thousand years ago
I saw the silent stranger
Walk the earth alone Twenty-seven faces
With their eyes turned to the sky
I've got a camera
And an airtight alibi I know they're out there
We see them coming
Faster than the speed of light
They greet us in the dead of the night Somewhere, someday, someone
They'll be light and sound
They'll alight on the ground
On which we stand Somewhere, someday, someone
Will help us to survive
They're gonna show us hell
And bring us back alive Well, I'm no poet, but I can't be fooled
The lies don't count, the whispers do
I hear the whispers on the wind
They say the earth has fallen due We run in circles
Our days are numbered
Every night I look away
To the heavens and I pray Come to us
Come to us Our lights are dim
Our roads are crumbling
And we don't know what to do
We're sick and tired
And dying to meet you
'Cause we bit off more than
We can chew She got less than you or I
She got less than me
She got less than you or I
She got less than me She get
She get
Tired
She gets tired She got more than you or I
She got more than me
She got more than you or I
She got more than me She get
She get
Wild
She gets wild Ballin' all night ballin' all day
She won't ball on me
Ballin' all night ballin' all day
She won't ball on me She will
She will
Smile
She will smile
She will laugh
She will die
She don't care Cryin' all night, cryin' all day
She will cry for me
Cryin' all night, cryin' all day
She will cry for me She will
She will
Smile
She will smile
She will laugh
She will die
She don't care Beneath the freeway at the cloverleaf junction
A symbol of good luck eminates darkness
The shadow will grow to cover California
Somewhere on the road from San Bernadino
Its future is steering the past ... will not pass Speed is the game in the shadow of kings
Where the company of angels fly
They appear at the crossroads at once in the future
Clad in the darkness on the highways of night
With no love ... from the past Night makes right
The symbol remains
Into the darkness
Must pour the brains
In the shadow of California Revolution by night grant me this future
Kings of the shadow on the highways of night
From San Bernadino these angels are racing
This night to your city
The host of angels ... Los Angeles Night makes right
The symbol remains
Into the darkness
Must pour the brains
In the shadow of California He cast a grim shadow
Through the busy street
Said, he was a junkie
And he punctuated his walk with a gun Motiveless murder
The papers scream
The cops all said
The crowd was iced by the sight Oh baby, don't it make you feel so bad
Dark clouds are over the street
After what I read, I can hardly feel my heart
My heart beat Oh baby, don't it make you feel so bad
Dark clouds are over the street
After what I read, I can hardly feel my heart
My heart beat Down the subway stairs
After him they leapt
An echo snap and scream of fire
The hot pursuit was done For the last time, he felt the light
And gave up his last fight Oh baby, don't it make you feel so bad
Dark clouds are over the street
After what I read, I can hardly feel my heart
My heart beat [Incomprehensible] Screams in the night, sirens delight
Heat, broken glass, Satan's bred trash Big city madness, comfort my soul
Give me a home where I can grow
String of bright lights running up to the sky
Throughout the hot night, the cars racing by
You know they all see, but most of them pass
She drives by my wares, don't hide in your glass wheel Screams in the night, sirens delight
Heat, broken glass, Satan's bred trash Big city madness, comfort my soul
Give me a home where I can grow
Sounds of guitars fill up the night
Can't make me feel, I said its alright
In one hotel bed, you think you can grow
If you find a home, please let me know Riding the underground
Swimming in sweat
A rumble above and below
Hey cop don't you know
The heat's on all right
The hot summer day didn't quit for the night 1277 express to heaven
Speeding along like dynamite
1277 express to heaven
Rumbles the steel like a dogfight
You caught me in a spell
Trying to leave but you know darn well
The heat from below can burn your eyes out Blackened out eyes
Scratched on the wall
Stoned out looks from the crowd
The king will not know
On the wall it was said
The flash of his cards was sprayed with red 1277 express to heaven
Speeding along like dynamite
1277 express to heaven
Rumbles the steel like a dog fight
You caught me in a spell
Trying to leave but you know darn well
The heat from below can burn your eyes out 1277 express to...
1277 express to...
1277 express to heaven
Speeding along like dynamite
1277 express to heaven
Rumbles the steel like a dogfight
You caught me in a spell
Trying to leave but you know darn well
The heat from below can burn, Yeah burn!
Your eyes out
Your eyes out Your eyes out!
out! out! out! out!
out! out! out! out! I have this feeling that my luck is none too good
This sword here at my side don't act the way it should
Keeps calling me its master, but I feel like its slave
Hauling me faster and faster to an early, early grave
And it howls! It howls like hell! I'm told it's my duty to fight against the law
That wizardry's my trade and I was born to wade through gore
I just want to be a lover, not a red-eyed screaming ghoul
I wish it'd picked another to be its killing tool Black Blade, Black Blade
Forged a billion years ago
Black Blade, Black Blade
Killing so its power can grow It's death from the beginning to the end of time
And I'm the cosmic champion and I hold a mystic sign
And the whole world's dying and the burden's mine
And the black sword keeps on killing 'til the end of time Black Blade, Black Blade
Bringing chaos to the world we know
Black Blade, Black Blade
And it's using me to kill my friends
Black Blade, Black Blade
Getting stronger so the world will end
Black Blade, Black Blade
Forcing my mind to bend and bend I am the Black Blade
Forged a million billion years ago
My cosmic soul it goes on for eternity
Carving out destiny
Bringing in the Lords of Chaos
Bringing up the Beasts of Hades
Sucking out the souls of heroes
Laying waste to knights and ladies
My master is my slave
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!
You poor fucking humans Death comes sweeping through the hallway
Like a lady's dress
Death comes driving down the highway
In its Sunday best A fire of unknown origin
Took my baby away
A fire of unknown origin
Took my baby away Swept her up and off my wavelength
Swallowed her up
Like the ocean in a fire
So thick and grey A fire of unknown origin
Took my baby away
A fire of unknown origin
Took my baby away Death comes driving
I can't do nothing
Death goes
There must be something
There must be something
That remains
There must be something
There must be something A fire of unknown origin
Took my baby away
A fire of unknown origin
Took my baby
Took my baby away You said you'd be here at a quarter to five
I didn't know if you were dead or alive
How long you think that I can sharpen my knife
I've got better things to do with my life It's almost the deadline
Don't miss the deadline, darling
When all your bad dreams will come true Don't miss the deadline
It's almost the deadline, darling
I wouldn't want it to happen to you Phil screamed at him, and he hung up the phone
I wonder if he ever felt more alone
He never finished his coffee that night
The photo they showed David was a terrible sight He missed the deadline
He passed the deadline, darling
And I believe that somehow he knew He crossed the deadline
He passed the deadline, darling
There wasn't a thing anybody could do Listen my darling, now, don't play with fire
You find a way to balance faith and desire It's almost the deadline
Don't miss the deadline darling
Consequences are easily misconstrued Don't miss the deadline
It's almost the deadline, darling
I couldn't live if it happened to you At the stroke of midnight
Staring at the phone
For the millionth time I'm all alone I'm the guy she turns to
When her lovers leave
I'm the wildcard
She's got up her sleeve
But she don't look at me With eyes on fire
Glowing like coals in the night
Hungry eyes
Burning with love and desire I'm like a long-lost brother
I'm closer than her friends
The only one on whom she can depend She thinks I'm sweet and gentle
She thinks the world of me
But late at night I'm not the one she needs
She never looks at me With eyes on fire
Glowing like coals in the night
Hungry eyes
Burning with love and desire Don't she, don't you see
I'm crying out loud
Can't she tell I need her now She never looks at me with
Eyes on fire
Glowing like coals in the night
Hungry eyes
Burning with love and desire She never looks at me with
Eyes on fire
Glowing like coals in the night
Hungry eyes
Reaching for me in the night I am becalmed in virtue
Lost to nothing on a bay of dreams
Warm weather and a holocaust
The tears of God flow as I bleed Left to die by two good friends
Abandoned me and put to sleep
On a shore where oyster beds
Seem plush as down
And ripe enough for the Luxor dream Recall the dream of Luxor
How fluids will arrive
As if by call or schedule
Resume through the morning tide
Where entry is by seaweed gate
And plan the plan of dreams
To lose oneself in reverb
In all that is and all that seems So ladies, fish and gentlemen
Here's my angled dream
See me in the blue sky bag
And meet me by the sea The oyster boys are swimming now
To claim me back from the dead
The creatures back from vertigo
They fear to fall but haven't fell
Will reclaim tries and try again The oyster boys are swimming now
Hear them chatter on the tide
Of the lost and language lost
Hear them chatter on the tide We understand, we understand, we understand
And so do I
We understand, we understand
But fright is real and so am I So ladies, fish and gentlemen
Here's my angled dream
See me in the blue sky bag
And meet me by the sea The entry to lost vestibule
Opens on the bay
An instant shape of mercury
Lost and then retained
An instant is an eyelash
Caught on the tide
Imaginos!
Below this bay
And then besides... The oyster boys are swimming now
One deal is what we made
Forest keys and whirlwind cold
Green trees too and keys of gold
Even locks that won't explode
When the skies become a scroll
Having lost its interest
See that's the deal we made
Just to join the Öyster Cult

They'd learned from men who'd just refrain
From glancing at a mirror's face Seven screaming diz-busters
Who lurk behind the rose
Cast iron for a bloodstream
And ice behind their eyes On each and all those holy nights
When duster's dust becomes the sale
And Lucifer the light, the light They're long so long this time of year
When stars be crossed by twirling fear
You don't suppose I'd prove surprised Well seven screaming diz-busters
Should go the route and die
Without that warmth they've learned to crave
With hardened smiles and evil signs (ah, well) Bury me near the secret cove
So they'll not know the way
Bury me round behind the rose
So they'll not rile my grave
I'll not reveal whose name's still lost Well their laughs of pain, Ah, ha, ha, ha! And their harder smiles...
And their rigid arms...
And their evil signs... The longer days and the longer nights
Yeah they're longer...
They're longer still On each and all those holy nights
When duster's dust becomes the sale
And Lucifer the light Lucifer the light
Lucifer the light
Lucifer the light
Lucifer the light
Lucifer the light Oh, the light
Lucifer the light I can't stand the light
Lucifer the light I can't stand it now
Lucifer the light No
Lucifer the light Can't stand the light
Lucifer the light
Lucifer the light Can't stand the light
Lucifer the light Can't stand the light
Lucifer the light
Lucifer the light Can't stand the light
Lucifer the light Oh no!
Lucifer the light Aahhh
Lucifer the light
Lucifer the light I can't I can't
Lucifer the light No
Lucifer the light Can't stand it
Lucifer the light Can't stand it, no
Lucifer the light Can't stand it
Lucifer the light Can't
Lucifer the light Can't I can't I can't can't can't can't stand it
Lucifer the light
Lucifer the light Just can't stand the light
Lucifer the light one
Lucifer the light two
Lucifer the light three
Lucifer the light four
Lucifer the light five
Lucifer the light six
Lucifer the light And seven I open my eyes
From a dreamless night
With a sense of dread
You could cut with a knife
So I'm thinking that
Maybe I killed somebody
You never know - you never know when
You might have killed somebody Veins in my eyeballs
Damage that I've done
Veins on the stairway
Veins in my skull I visit my friend
We have a fight
I'm drinking his whiskey
I'm wanting his wife
Then the image goes black
Did I kill somebody?
'Cause there ain't no clue, there's no clue
That I killed somebody Veins in my eardrum
Banging at my door
Veins in my brainwaves
Veins on the floor I get the shivers
And I've got the shakes
People screaming my name
Like there's no mistake
Can't believe it's true
Did I kill somebody?
But I just don't know, I don't know
Did I kill somebody? Veins on the sidewalk
Veins know the score
Veins in my mind, oh
Veins evermore With satan's hog no pig at all, and the weather getting dry
We'll head south from altamont in a cold blooded travelled trance
So clear the road my bully boys and let some thunder pass
We're pain, we're steel, a plot of knives,
We're transmaniacon MC Behind the pantry, behind the tree, the ghouls adopt that child
Whose name resounds forever, whose name resounds on terror
And I'm no fool to call that hog, cause man I remember
Those who did resign their souls
To transmaniacon MC And surely we did offer up behind that stage at dawn
Beers and barracuda, reds and monocaine
Pure nectar of antipathy behind that stage at dawn
To those who would resign their souls
To transmaniacon MC Cry the cable, cry the word, unknown terror's here
And won't you try this tasty snack, behind the scenes or but the back
Which was the stage at altamont, my humble boys of listless power:
We're pain, we're steel, a plot of knives
We're transmaniacon MC Tomorrow soon turns into yesterday.
Everything we see just fades away.
There's sky and sand where mountains used to be.
Time drops by a second to eternity. It doesn't matter if we turn to dust;
Turn and turn and turn we must!
I guess I'll see you dancin' in the ruins tonight!
Dancin' in the ruins!
Guess I'll see you dancin' in the ruins tonight! There's laughter where I used to see your tears.
It's all done with mirrors, have no fears.
There's nothing pure or sacred in our time.
The nights we spend together are no crime. It doesn't matter if we turn to dust;
Turn and turn and turn we must!
I guess I'll see you dancin' in the ruins tonight!
Dancin' in the ruins!
Guess I'll see you dancin' in the ruins tonight! Like marble statues all with gold inlaid
In castles built of silence, let us play.
Even though our skulls rot in our flesh.
We can build a laser, tear the mesh. It doesn't matter if we turn to dust;
Turn and turn and turn we must.
I guess I'll see you dancin' in the ruins tonight! Dancin' in the ruins!
Guess I'll see you dancin' in the ruins tonight! Dancin' in the ruins!
Guess I'll see you dancin' in the ruins tonight! Dancin' in the ruins!
Guess I'll see you dancin' in the ruins tonight!
Dancin' in the ruins! Moments of pleasure, in a world of pain.
Working together, only to fight again.
If we wait for the world leaders to decide, who will die first?
So don't wait no more! Time we made make rock not war! What are we dying for?
Rock not war! Nobody wins!
Rock not war! What are we trying for?
And the fools rush in, don't they,
For the grand beginning of the end! Pulses are racing. You know the blade may fall.
Destinies tracing. I sing to a great star-fall.
And you know there's a real answer, but they won't let it be told.
We've heard the lies before! Time we made make rock not war! What are we dying for?
Rock not war! Nobody wins!
Rock not war! What are we trying for?
And the fools rush in, don't they,
For the grand beginning of the end! The hourglass turns over, and time is running low.
Will the sandman's pollen bring sleep before we know? Yeah, you know there's a real answer,
And we've gotten what we've taught. 
So don't wait no more!
Time we made make rock not war! What are we dying for?
Rock not war! Nobody wins!
Rock not war! What are we trying for?
And the fools rush in, don't we,
For the grand beginning of the end! Make rock not war!
Make rock not war!
Make rock not war!
Make rock not war!
Make rock not war! On the terminal point
Of the cul-de-sac
Patients are dying
The horses are dazed
From the glare of stars
The starry wisdom

Reins of steel, and it's alright

Rock and roll
... In a dark horse town, in the middle of the west
Where Friday takes so long to arrive
Johnny wakes up dreaming turns on the radio
The he jumps up plays his guitar in the mirror
Starts his day with a rock and roll pose
Tonight's the night that Susie and he
Are going to a rock and roll show Tonight! I'm gonna see some rock and roll!
Yeah, my favorite group is playing!
Tonight! I'm gonna see some rock and roll! Well it's showtime and he's caught up in the crowd
He hates the crush but he loves the music loud
He reaches out and Susie's disappeared,
Now Johnny's standing on a corner after the show
Looking for his Susie dear
But there goes his Susie - in the band's limousine!
Yeah, well that's the way it goes at these rock and roll shows That's the way it goes - it's rock and roll
That's the way it goes - it's rock and roll Now Susie's gone, and Johnny hears the thunder
As he rolls another number and he counts
He counts the times he's felt himself to be the hero
'Cause ever since he was a boy
He's heard about adventure
As he looks into the mirror now he knows
He must be the star and play guitar like thunder
Find Susie at his rock and roll show Boy, if I only had a good guitar and a big amp
Boy, it wouldn't be somebody else taking my girl away... tell ya
I know what I should do... I'll put an ad in the paper
Get a few other guys who want to play as much as I do
Tell ya, I ain't playin' no surf music
I'm gonna play some heavy music
I'm gonna play bad
I'm gonna play loud
I know just what I want it to sound like
It's gonna sound like...
It's gonna sound like... This is Don Kirshner
And tonight on Don Kirshner's Rock Concert
A new phenomenon in the music world
With six million albums to his credit in just two short years
My good friend, here's Johnny! Now Johnny became a legend in his time
Found it easier to live in pain
Half a hero in a hard-hearted game
Now it's showtime and he's caught up in the flow
He hates the rush but he needs the music so
Still he reaches out but Susie's disappeared
Well that's the way it goes at these rock and roll shows It's rock and roll
That's the way it goes - It's rock and roll They have killed the great sun jester
Who danced between the stars
They have stripped him of his manhood
Signs of Venus and of Mars
The cynics left him weeping
And the jackals left him torn
And the jester reaches out bind hands
He can touch the stars no more. CHORUS:
And he took the stars in his hands
And as he scattered them he'd shout
"I'm the joker of the universe
I'm what it's all about."
Now he's dying in his grief
And the hard men dragged him down
They have killed the wild-eyed jester
They have killed the fireclown Now his blind eyes seek the starlight
And his fingers seek controls
To take him into space again
Where he was both young and old
The dancers stiff with pain
And they've made him kneel too long
And the madness they have driven out
They've left him cold and sane. CHORUS He'll never - sing his songs - again...
He'll never dance between the stars - again...
He'll never laught - again...
No he'll never ever laugh again...
Oh, no... How could I fool you I rest and assure you
Take it off from here and put you on the line, yeah
Your back to the pistol and iron bullets whistle
Landscape's open and the world is mine, it's still mine
Od'd on life, life itself
Od'd on life, life itself
Od'd on life itself
Writings appear on the wall
The curtains part and landscape fall
There the writings done in blood
Yeah, like a mummy's inscription and a bat wing tongue
Well then the mouth of the cave will open up wide
Wide as the world that's mine, it's mine, it's
Still mine
So don't you fear the trade in life
Life loves force but force loves life
This wedding by heaven was made up in hell
With the victim as bride and life, life itself
Od'd on life, life itself (repeat ad nauseam) Feeling easy on the outside
But not so funny on the inside
Feel the sound, pray for rain
For this is the night we ride This ain't the garden of eden
There ain't no angels above
And things ain't like what they used to be
And this ain't the summer of love Lock all your doors from the outside
The key will dangle by the inside
You may begin to understand
That this is the night we ride This ain't the garden of eden
There ain't no angels above
And things ain't like what they used to be
And this ain't the summer of love On the night we ride... this ain't the summer of love. This ain't the garden of eden
There ain't no angels above
And things ain't like what they used to be
And this ain't the summer of love
This ain't the summer, this ain't, this ain't
This ain't the summer of love "When the bones of our oppressors have turned to dust
And the cause that we serve rules the world
In a vision, visitation, all hail the revolution!" A vision
All hail the revolution
Armies of the past retreat
In the wake of revolution
A journey to the country
Of the fourth dimension
Spectacle of awakening light
The soldiers are baffled but still they fight Ooka chaka ooka chaka
Ooka chaka ooka chaka
Ooka chaka ooka chaka Creator, destroyer, victory, defeat
I did not come to bring us sleep
Black flag, red flag, space and time
The future is my mind Judgement day descends upon us
After the revolution
The virgins come to set you free
On their lips the light called truth
In minus time or victory
Energy imprisoned will make itself free Ooka chaka ooka chaka
Ooka chaka ooka chaka
Ooka chaka ooka chaka
Ooka chaka ooka chaka Creator, destroyer, victory, defeat

War comes

Soar o'er the churches
Pursued by an army of birds in the rain None of them can see the clouds
The polished wings don't care
Animal waves through the hazy
Dreams full of pain Wings wetted down
Stumbling on the ground
It all turns around
In the end, the end, the end The voices sound deadly
Sometimes I hear
Echoes of empires
Spread throughout the sky Wings wetted down
Stumbling on the ground
It all turns around
In the end, the end, the end Flights of black horseman
Soar o'er the churches
Pursued by an army of birds in the rain Wings wetted down

It all turns around

Cities on flame now, with rock and roll You see me now, a veteran of a thousand psychic wars
I've been living on the edge so long
Where the winds of limbo roar
And I'm young enough to look at
And far too old to see
All the scars are on the inside I'm not sure if there's anything left of me Don't let these shakes go on
It's time we had a break from it
It's time we had some leave
We've been living in the flames
We've been eating up our brains
Oh, please, don't let these shakes go on You ask me why I'm weary
Why I can't speak to you
You blame me for my silence
Say it's time I changed and grew
But the war's still going on, dear
And there's no end that I know
And I can't say I'm forever I can't say if we're ever gonna be free Don't let these shakes go on
It's time we had a break from it
It's time we had some leave
We've been living in the flames
We've been eating up our brains
Oh, please, don't let these shakes go on You see me now a veteran
Of a thousand psychic wars
My energy's spent at last
And my armor is destroyed
I have used up all my weapons
And I'm helpless and bereaved
Wounds are all I'm made of Did I hear you say that this is victory? Don't let these shakes go on
It's time we had a break from it
Send me to the rear
Where the tides of madness swell
And been sliding into Hell
Oh, please, don't let these shakes go on
Don't let these shakes go on
Don't let these shakes go on Drivin' alone into the darkness
I heard you call my name
And the roar of the engine
Is calling me to blame
Tears in my mirror cryin' for the people behind us
But I know I won't let you go, oh no Here comes that feeling again
I'm wrapping my dreams around you
And our love is healin' again
After all we've been through And I know there's a place inside of my heart
That the road will never find
And I'm afraid the approaching headlights
Will someday leave me blind
You shatter the mirror
Fight off the forces that drive me on tonight
I won't let you go, oh no Here comes that feeling again
I'm wrapping my dreams around you
And our love is healin' again
After all we've been through Baby, climb into the night time
Girl, this moment is the right time Drivin' on and I'm still hungry
To make the next town
And this road's the only
thing that could bring us down
If it keeps me driving
I swear I'll never leave you behind
And I know I can't let you go, oh no Here comes that feeling again
I'm wrapping my dreams around you
And our love is healin' again
After all we've been through Here comes that feeling again
Here comes that feeling again I used to lie in my bed
Sleep wouldn't come
Thinkin' 'bout things that they said
They led me on
All of the fancy ladies
Oh they could talk and talk I shot for the highest star
But I aimed too high
You wanted a rich rock star
But he made you cry
Now that we have each other
We can laugh about it You're not the one I was lookin' for but
You're the one for me (you're the one)
I'm not the one you were lookin' for but
You can't go wrong with me
You're not the one I was lookin' for but
You're oh so good for me Now I can't make it without
I can't go on
We can make beautiful music
And prove them wrong
We've been put down by the best
And now we laugh about it, ya You're not the one I was lookin' for but
You're the one for me (you're the one)
I'm not the one you were lookin' for but
You can't go wrong with me
You're not the one I was lookin' for but
You're oh so good for me You're oh so good for me (You're so good)
You're oh so good for me (You're so good)
You're oh so good for me (You're so good) I'd like to see you in black
It'd make me feel like your husband's dead
I'd like to see you in black
We could make him suffer instead I'd like to see you in black I'd like to see you in black
I'd like to see you in black I'd like to see you in black You can't lie to me Ann
You can't pretend he isn't beating you up
I saw the marks on your hands
I saw the blood on your coffee cup I'd like to see you in black I'd like to see you in black
I'd like to see you in black I'd like to see you in black
I'd like to see you in black I'd like to see you in black
I'd like to see you in black
I'd like to see you in black The wind plucks your black lace gown
You're standin' proudly beside his grave
I see you wearing black
Gently smiling and oh so brave We'll run away to Greece
We'll walk the ruins of the Parthenon
We'll drink ouzo in our tub
Watch the dust billow 'til the night's gone I'd like to see you in black I'd like to see you in black
I'd like to see you in black I'd like to see you in black
I'd love to see you in black I'd love to see you in black
I'd like to see you in black
I'd like to see you in black
In black
In black

Summertime and the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high
Oh, your daddy's rich and your ma is good lookin'
So hush little baby, don't you cry One of these mornings, you're goin' to rise up singin'
Then you spread your wings and you'll take the sky
But 'til that mornin', there's nothin' can harm you
With daddy and mammy standin' by One of these mornings, you're goin' to rise up singin'
Then you spread your wings and you'll take the sky
But 'til that mornin', there's nothin' can harm you
With daddy and mammy standin' by Blue moon
you saw me standing alone
without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for And then they suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper
Please adore me
And when I looked
The moon had turned to gold Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own Blue moon
you saw me standing alone
without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for And then they suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper
Please adore me
And when I looked
The moon had turned to gold Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own Blue moon Southern trees bear strange fruit
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees. Pastoral scene of the gallant south
The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth
Scent of magnolias, sweet and fresh
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh. Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck
For the sun to rot, for the trees to drop
Here is a strange and bitter crop. I'll be seeing you
In all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces
All day through. In that small cafe;
The park across the way;
The children's carosel;
The chestnut trees;
The wishin' well. I'll be seeing you
In every lovely summer's day;
In every thing that's light and gay.
I'll always think of you that way. I'll find you
In the morning sun
And when the night is new.
I'll be looking at the moon,
But I'll be seeing you. I'll be seeing you
In every lovely summer's day;
In every thing that's light and gay.
I'll always think of you that way. I'll find you
In the morning sun
And when the night is new.

So the Bible says and it still is news
Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own, that's got his own Yes the strong get smart
While the weak ones fade
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade
Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own, that's got his own Money, you've got lots of friends
Crowding around your door
When you're gone and spending ends
They don't come no more Rich relations give crusts of bread and such
You can help yourself, but don't take too much
Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own, that's got his own The very thought of you
i forget to do
those little ordinary things
that everyone ought to do
i'm livin' in a kind of a daydream
i'm happy as a queen
and foolish though it may seem
to me that's everything
the mere idea of you
the longing here for you
you'll never know
how slow the moments go
till i'm near to you
i see your face in every flower
your eyes in stars above
it's just the thought of you,
the very thought of you, my love
i see your face in every flower
your eyes in stars above
it's just the thought of you
the very thought of you, my love
i see your face in every flower
your eyes in stars above
it's just the thought of you
the very thought of you, my love
i see your face in every flower
your eyes in stars above
it's just the thought of you,
the very thought of you, my love
i see your face in every flower
your eyes in stars above
it's just the thought of you
the very thought of you, my love
i see your face in every flower
your eyes in stars above
it's just the thought of you
the very thought of you, my love All of me
Why not take all of me
Can't you see
I'm no good without you Take my lips
I want to lose them
Take my arms
I'll never use them Your Goodbye
Left me with eyes that cry
How can I go on dear without you You took the part
That once was my heart
So why not take all of me All of me
Why not take all of me
Can't you see
I'm no good without you Take my lips
I want to lose them
Take my arms I'll never use them Your goodbye
Left me with eyes that cry
How can I go on dear without you
You took the best
So why not take the rest
Baby take all of me Speak low when you speak, love
Our summer day withers away too soon, too soon
Speak low when you speak, love
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift, 
we're swept apart, too soon Speak low, darling, speak low
Love is a spark, lost in the dark too soon, too soon
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, 
tomorrow is here and always too soon Time is so old and love so brief
Love is pure gold and time a thief We're late, darling, we're late
The curtain descends, everything ends too soon, too soon
I wait, darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me, speak love to me and soon Time is so old and love so brief
Love is pure gold and time a thief We're late, darling, we're late
The curtain descends, everything ends too soon, too soon
I wait, darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me, speak love to me and soon
Speak low Don't know why there's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all the time Life is bare, gloom and mis'ry everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor self together
I'm weary all the time, the time
So weary all the time When he went away
The blues walked in and met me
If he stays away, old rockin' chair will get me
All I do is pray, the Lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more Can't go on, ev'rything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all the time
Keeps rainin' all the time When he went away
The blues walked in and met me
If he stays away, old rockin' chair will get me
All I do is pray, the Lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more Can't go on, ev'rything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all the time
Keeps rainin' all the time These Foolish Things (Remind Me Of You)
Tony Bennett
Words by Holt Marvell
Music by Jack Strachey and Harry Link This version did not chart but
In 1936, five versions did: Benny Goodman (# 1), Teddy Wilson with Billie Holiday (# 5), Nat
Brandywynne (# 6), Carroll Gibbons (# 8), and Joe Sanders (# 17)
Then in 1947 Red Ingles, who perfected his novelty vocals with Spike Jones, charted a
humorous version, "Them Durn Fool Things" at # 26. 
A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumblin' words that told you what my heart meant
A fairground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you You came, you saw, you conquered me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things remind me of you How strange, how sweet, to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside, dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things remind me of you ---------
Other Version These Foolish Things
Benny Goodman
(Marvell/Strachey/Link)
(Brian Ferry, 1973) oh will you never let me be
oh will you never set me free
the ties that bound us
are still around us
there's no escape that I can see
and still those little things remain
that bring me happiness or pain a cigarette that bears a lipsticks traces
an airline ticket to romantic places
and still my heart has wings
these foolish things
remind me of you a tinkling piano in the next apartment
those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
a fairgrounds painted swings
these foolish things
remind me of you you came
you saw
you conquered me
when you did that to me I somehow knew this had to be the winds of March that make my heart a dancer
a telephone that rings but who's to answer
oh how the ghost of you clings
these foolish things
remind me of you gardenia perfume lingering on a pillow
wild strawberries only 7 francs a kilo
and still my heart has wings
these foolish things
remind me of you I know
that this
was bound to be
these things have haunted me for you=B9ve entirely enchanted me the sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
silk stockings thrown aside, dance invitations
oh how the ghost of you clings
these foolish things
remind me of you the smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
the waiters whistling as the last bar closes
the song that Crosby sings
these foolish things
remind me of you how strange
how sweet
to find you still
these things are dear to me; yhey seem to bring you so near to me the scent of smould'ring leaves the wail of steamers
two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
oh how the ghost of you clings
these foolish things
remind me of you
just you Jerome Kern / Otto Harbach Yesterdays
Yesterdays
Days I knew as happy sweet
Sequestered days
Olden days
Golden days
Days of mad romance and love Then gay youth was mine
Truth was mine
Joyous free in flame and life
Then sooth was mine
Sad am I
Glad am I
For today I'm dreamin' of

Yesterdays Roy Turk / Fred E. Ahlert You're mean to me
Why must you be mean to me?
Gee, honey, it seems to me
You love to see me cryin'
I don't know why
I stay home each night
When you say you phone
You don't and I'm left alone.
Sing the blues and sighin'
You treat me coldly each day in the year
You always scold me
Whenever somebody is near, dear
I must be great fun to be mean to me
You shouldn't, for can't you see
What you mean to me Lord I love my man, tell the world I do
I love my man, tell the world I do
But when he mistreats me
Makes me feel so blue My man wouldn't give me no breakfast
Wouldn't give me no dinner
Fought about my supper and put me outdoors
Had the dark clay make black spots on my clothes
I didn't have so many
But I had a long, long way to go
Some men like me talkin' happy
Some calls it snappy
Some call me honey
Others think I got money
Some tell me baby you're built for speed
Now if you put that all together
Makes me everthing a good man needs Living for you is easy living
It's easy to live when you're in love
And I'm so in love
There's nothing in life but you I'll never regret the things I'm giving
They're easy to give when you're in love
I'm happy to do whatever I do for you For you maybe I'm a fool, but it's fun
People say you rule me with one wave of your hand
Darling, it's grand, they just don't understand Living for you is easy living
It's easy to live when you're in love
And I'm so in love
There's nothing in life but you For you maybe I'm a fool, but it's fun
People say you rule me with one wave of your hand
Baby, it's grand, they just don't understand Living for you is easy living
It's easy to live when you're in love
And I'm so in love
There's nothing in life but you When you're smiling
When you're smiling
The whole world smiles with you When you're laughing
When you're laughing
The sun comes shining through But when you're crying
You bring on the rain
So stop your sighing, be happy again Keep on smiling
'Cause when you're smiling
The whole world smiles with you Please don't talk about me when I'm gone
Though our friendship ceases from now on
And listen, if you can't say anything real nice
It's better not to talk at all, that's my advice We're parting, you go your way, I'll go mine, it's best that we do
Here's a kiss, I hope that this brings lots of luck to you
Makes no difference how I carry on
Just don't you talk about me when I'm gone Please don't talk about me when I'm gone
Though our friendship ceases from now on
And listen, if you can't say anything real nice
Just don't talk at all, that's my advice We're parting, you go your way, I'll go mine, it's best that we do
But here's a kiss and I hope that this brings lots of luck to you
Makes no difference how I carry on
Just don't talk, please don't talk
Don't you talk about me when I'm gone You've changed
That sparkle in your eyes has gone
Your smile is just a careless yawn
You're breaking my heart, you've changed You've changed
Your kisses are now so blase
You're bored with me in every way
I can't understand, you've changed You've forgotten the words, I love you
Each memory that we've shared
You ignore every star above you
I can't realize you ever cared You've changed
You're not the angel I once knew
No need to tell me that we're through
It's all over now, you've changed You've forgotten the words, I love you
Each memory that we've shared
You ignore every star above you
I can't realize you ever cared You've changed
You're not the angel I once knew
No need to tell me that we're through
It's all over now, you've changed
You've changed (Dorothy Fields / Jimmy McHugh) Grab your coat and get your hat.
Leave your worry on the doorstep.
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street. Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step.
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street. I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade,
But now I'm not afraid.
This rover crossed over. If I never have a cent,
I'll be rich as Rockefeller.
Gonna set my feet
On the sunny side of the street. Grab your coat and get your hat.
Leave your worry on the doorstep.
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street. Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step.
Live can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street. I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade,
But now I'm not afraid.
This rover crossed over. If I never have a cent,
I'll be rich as Rockefeller
With gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street. Harry Tobias / Ingraham No regrets
Although our love affair has gone astray
No regrets
I know I'll always care though you're away
So now our happy romance ended suddenly
Still in my heart you'll be forever mine
No regrets
Because somebody new looks good to you
No regrets
Sweetheart no matter what you say or do
I know our love will linger
When the other love forgets
So I say goodbye with no regrets No regrets
Because somebody new looks good to you
No regrets
Sweetheart no matter what you say or do
I know our love will linger
When the other love forgets
So I say goodbye with no regrets In my solitude
You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send me back my love Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view
Then if you fall, once and for all
I'll see my dreams come true Moments to spare with someone you care
For one love affair for two
And so with time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you Moments to spare with someone you care
For one love affair for two
And so with time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you Autumn in New York, why does it seem so inviting?
Autumn in New York, it spells the thrill of first-nighting.
Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds in canyons of steel;
they're making me feel: I'm home. It's autumn in New York that brings the promise of new love.
Autumn in New York is often mingled with pain.
Dreamers with empty hands may sigh for exotic lands;
It's autumn in New York;
It's good to live it again. Autumn in New York, the gleaming rooftops at sundown
Autumn in New York, it lifts you up when you're let down
jaded roués and gay divorces who lunch at the Ritz
will tell you that it's devine It's autumn in New York transforms the slums into Mayfair
Autumn in New York, you'll need no castle in Spain
Lovers that bless the dark
On benches in Central Park
Greet autumn in New York,
It's good to live it again Great site thanks

DK-3520 Farum, Denmark Good morning, heartache, you ole gloomy sight
Good morning, heartache, thought we'd said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone
But here you are with the dawn
Wish I'd forget you
but you're here to stay
It seems I met you
When my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning, heartache, what's new? Stop haunting me now
Can't shake you, no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues Good morning, heartache, here we go again
Good morning, hearache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hangin around
Good morning, heartache, sit down Stop haunting me now
Can't shake you, no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues Good morning, heartache, here we go again
Good morning, hearache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hangin around
Good morning, heartache, sit down Is it a sin, is it a crime
Loving you dear like I do?
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you Maybe I'm wrong dreaming of you
Dreaming the lonely night through
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of dreaming of you What can I do, what can I say
After I've taken the blame?
You say, you're through, you'll go your way
But I'll always feel just the same Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Loving you dear like I do
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you What can I do, what can I say
After I've taken the blame?
You say, you're through, you'll go your way
But I'll always feel just the same Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Loving you dear like I do
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea
Casts a spell over me
Still I say to myself "Get a hold of yourself"
Can't you see that it never can be You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand Julys
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head Don Raye Gene De
Paul You don't know what love is Until you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had to lose
You don't know what love is You don't know how lips hurt Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost You don't know what love is You, you're driving me crazy
What did I do? What ever did I do?
My tears for you, they make everything hazy
Clouding the skies that used to be blue How true were the friends who were near me
To cheer me, believe me, they knew
But you, you were the kind who would hurt me
Desert me when I needed you Yes you, you are driving me crazy
What did I do, did I do to you? How true were the friends who were near me
To cheer me, believe me, they knew
But you were the kind who would hurt me
Desert me when I needed you Yes you, baby, you, you're are driving me crazy
What did I do? Tell me what did I do? Please, what did I do to you? Dear, I thought I'd drop a line
The weather's cool, the folks are fine
I'm in bed each night at nine
P.S. I love you Yesterday we had some rain
But all in all, I can't complain
Was it dusty on the train?
P.S. I love you Write to the browns just as soon as you're able
They came around to call
And I burned a hole in the dining room table
Now let me think, I guess that's all Nothing else for me to say
And so I'll close, but by the way
Everybody's thinking of you
P.S. I love you Write to the browns just as soon as you're able
They came around to call
And I burned a hole in the dining room table
Now let me think, I guess that's all Nothing else for me to say
And so I'll close, but by the way
Everybody's thinking of you
P.S. I love you, love you, love you There ain't nothing I can do
Or nothing I can say
That folks don't criticize me
But I'm going to do
Just as I want to anyway
And don't care just what people say
If I should take a notion
To jump into the ocean
Ain't nobody's business if I do
If I go to church on Sunday
Then cabaret all day Monday
Ain't nobody's business if I do
If my man ain't got no money
And I say "take all mine, honey"
Ain't nobody's business if I do
If I give him my last nickel
And it leaves me in a pickle
Ain't nobody's business if I do
But I'd rather my man would hit me
Than follow him to jump up and quit me
Ain't nobody's business if I do
I swear I won't call no copper
If I'm beat up by my papa
Ain't nobody's business if I do
Nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business
Nobody's business if I do Be sure it's true when you say, 'I love you'
It's a sin to tell a lie
Millions of hearts have been broken
Just because these words were spoken I love you, yes, I do, I love you
If you break my heart I'll die
So be sure that it's true when you say, 'I love you'
It's a sin to tell a lie I love you, yes, I do, I love you
If you break my heart I'll die
So be sure that it's true when you say, 'I love you'
It's a sin to tell a lie
It's a sin to tell a lie Duke Ellington / Irving Gordon / Irving Mills If you hear a song in blue like a flower crying for the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My PRELUDE TO A KISS
If you hear a song that grows from my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A PRELUDE TO A KISS
Though it's just a simple melody with nothing fancy, nothing much
You could turn it to a simphony a Schubert tune with a Gershwin touch
Oh! How My love song gently cries for the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A PRELUDE TO A KISS. I say I'll move the mountains
And I'll move the mountains
If he wants them out of the way
Crazy he calls me
Sure, I'm crazy
Crazy in love, I say I say I'll go through fire
And I'll go through fire
As he wants it, so it will be
Crazy he calls me
Sure, I'm crazy
Crazy in love, you see Like the wind that shakes the bough
He moves me with a smile
The difficult I'll do right now
The impossible will take a little while I say I'll care forever
And I mean forever
If I have to hold up the sky
Crazy he calls me
Sure, I'm crazy
Crazy in love am I Like the wind that shakes the bough
He moves me with a smile
The difficult I'll do right now
The impossible will take a little while I say I'll care forever
And I mean forever
If I have to hold up the sky
Crazy he calls me
Sure, I'm crazy
Crazy in love am I 
 Johnny Mercer / Bernie Hanighen / Gordon Jenkins Maybe he's not much, just another man
Doing what he can
But what does she care
When a woman loves a man
She'll just string along
All through thick and thin
Till his ship comes in
It's always that way
When a woman love a man
She'll be the first one to praise him
When he's goin' strong
The last one to blame him
When everything's wrong
It's such a one-sided game that they play
But women are funny that way
Tell her she's a fool
She'll say yes, I know
But I love him so
And that's how it goes
When a woman loves a man
Tel I her she's a fool
She'll say yes, I know
But I love him so
And that's how if goes
When a woman loves a man "There is no greater love than what I feel for you
No greater love, no heart so true There is no greater thrill than what you bring to me
No sweeter song than that you sing to me You're the sweetest thing I have ever known
and to think that you are mine alone There is no greater love in all the world; it's true
No greater love than what I feel for you You're the sweetest thing I have ever known
And to think that you are mine alone There is no greater love in all the world; it's true
No greater love than what I feel for you" I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down

Pulls that man around by her
If it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere
I got the St. Louis Blues
Blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint'n rye
I love my man till the day I die It cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got
It's my man
It's my man Cold or wet
Tired, you bet
All of this I'll soon forget
With my man He's not much on looks
He's no hero out of books
But I love him
Yes, I love him Two or three girls
Has he
That he likes as well as me
But I love him I don't know why I should
He isn't true
He beats me, too
What can I do? Oh, my man, I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just a spare
But I don't care
When he takes me in his arms
The world is bright
All right What's the difference if I say
I'll go away
When I know I'll come back
On my knees someday For whatever my man is
I'm his forevermore Al Dubin / Harry Warren You told me that I was like an angel
Told me I was fit to wear a crown
So that you could get a thrill
You put me on a pedestal
And then you let me down, let me down. You told me that I'd be wearing diamonds
I would have the smartest car in town
Made me think that I'm the top
And then you let the ladder drop
You know you let me down, let me down I walked upon a rainbow
I clung onto a star
You had me up in heaven
That's why I had to tall so far I was even looking for a cottage
I was measured for a wedding gown
That how I got cynical
You put me on a pinnacle
And then you let me down, let me down
How you let me down I'm a fool to want you
I'm a fool to want you
To want a love that can't be true
A love that's there for others too I'm a fool to hold you
Such a fool to hold you
To seek a kiss not mine alone
To share a kiss the Devil has known Time and time again I said I'd leave you
Time and time again I went away
But then would come the time when I would need you And once again these words I'll have to say
"I'm a fool to want you
Pity me, I need you
I know it's wrong, it must be wrong
But right or wrong I can't get along
Without you" I can't get along
Without you I've been around the world in a plane
Settled revolutions in Spain
The North Pole I have charted
But can't get started with you And at the golf course I'm under par
Metro-Goldwyn wants me to star
I've got a house and a show place
But can't get no place with you You're so supreme, the lyrics I write of you
Dream, dream, day and night of you
Scheme just for the sight of you
But what good will it do? I've been consulted by Franklin D
Even Gable had me to tea
But now I'm broken hearted
Can't get started with you You're so supreme, the lyrics I write of you
Dream, dream, day and night of you
Scheme just for the sight of you
But what good does it do? I've been consulted by Franklin D
Even Basic had me to tea
But now I'm broken hearted
Can't get started with you When the only sound on the empty street
Is the heavy tread of the heavy feet
That belong to a lonesome cop
I open shop
When the moon so long has been gazing down
On the wayward ways of this wayward town
That her smile becomes a smirk
I go to work Love for sale

Love that's fresh and still unspoiled.
Love that's only slightly soiled.

Way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow
That led me straight to you I still hear you saying
"Dear one, hold me fast"
And I start in praying
Oh Lord, please let this last We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from ev'ry where
And now when there's moonglow

I always remember that moonglow brought me you I? ll look around until I? ve found
Someone who laughs like you I know somewhere spring must fill the air

As the flower that you gave me to wear I'll look around and when I? ve found
Someone who sighs like you

Won? t be the old love I always knew Arthur Johnson / Sam Coslow My old flame
I can't even think of his name
But it's funny now and then
How my thoughts go flashing back again
To my old flame
My old flame
My new lovers all seem so tame
For I haven't met a gent So innocent or elegant
As my old flame I've met so many men
With fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eyes
Som who sent me up to the skies
But their attempts at love
Were only imitations of
My old flame
I can't even think of his name
But I'll never be the same
Untill I discover what became
Of my old flame I've met so many men
With fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eyes
Som who sent me up to the skies
But their attempts at love
Were only imitations of
My old flame
I can't even think of his name
But I'll never be the same
Untill I discover what became
Of my old flame (Clarence Gaskill / Jimmy McHugh) Your eyes so blue
Your kisses too
I never knew what they could do
I can't believe you're in love with me You're telling everyone I know
I'm on your mind each place you go
They can't believe that you're in love with me
I have always placed you far above me
I just can't image that you love me
And after all is said and done
To think that I'm the lucky one
I can't believe you're in love with me (George & Ira gershwin / Dubose Heyward) I love you, porgy
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me
And drive me mad If you can keep me
I want to stay with you forever
And I'll be glad I love you, porgy
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me
With his hot hands If you can keep me
I want to stay with you forever
I like my man Someday I know he's coming
Back to call me
He's gonna handle me
And hold me so It's going to be like dying, porgy
When he calls me
But when he comes, I know
I'll have to go Irving Berlin How can I tell you what is in my heart?
How can I measure each and every part?
How can I tell you how much I love you?
How can I measure just how much I do? How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky? How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew? How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star? And if I ever lost you
How much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky? Leo robin / ralph rainger I'm having myself a time
I mean I'm having what I want
Wanting what I have
Doing what I like
And liking what I do
And I'm having myself a time I never could save a dime
And so I'm living like a lord
Acting like, a loon
Lying in the sun
And sighing in the moon 
And I'm having myself a lime When I hum songs
They're all dumb songs
Without reason nor rhyme
But I'm certainly in my prime
I friean I'm happy as a bird, flying up above
Walk a little love and get a little love
And I'm having myself a time But I'm certainly in my prime
I mean I'm happy as a bird, flying up above
Walk a little love and get a little love
And I'm having myself a time Cole Porter I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me
Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every homefire burning for
We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
'Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love It's that ole devil called Love Game
Gets behind me and keeps giving me that shock again
Put a ring in my eyes
Tears in my dreams
And rocks in my heart It's that sly ole sun of a gun again
He keeps telling me that I'm the lucky one again
But I still have that ring
Still have those tears
And those rocks in my heart Suppose I didn't stay and ran away, wouldn't play
That devil what a potion he would brew
He'd follow me around
Build me up, tear me down
Till I'd be so bewildered
I wouldn't know what to do Might as well give up the fight again
I know darn well he'll convince me
And that he's right again
When he sings that siren song
I just gotta tag along
With that ole devil called Love He'd follow around
Build me up, tear me down
Till I'd be so bewildered
I wouldn't know what to do Might as well give up the fight again
I know darn well he'll convince me
And that he's right again
When he sings that siren song
I just gotta tag along
With that ole devil called Love
With that ole devil called Love You took my kisses and all my love
You taught me how to care
Am I to be just remnant of a one side love affair All you took
I gladly gave
There is nothing left for me to save All of me
Why not take all of me
Can't you see
I'm no good without you
Take my lips
I want to lose them
Take my arms
I'll never use them
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
How can I go on dear without you
You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me Jack Lawrence / Arthur Altman All or nothing at all
Half love never appealled to me
If your heart never could yield to me
Then I'd rather have nothing at all All or nothing at all
If it's love there is no in between
Why begin, then cry for something that might have been
No, I rather have nothing at all
But, please, don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may grow dizzy and fall
And if I fell under the spell of your call
I would be caught in the undertow
So, you see, I've got to say
No, no
All or nothing at all You better go now
Because I like you much, too much You have a way with you
You ought to know now
Just why I like you very much
The night was gay with you There's the moon above
And it gives my heart a lot of swing
In your eyes there's love
And the way I feel it must be spring I want you so now
You have lips I love to touch
You better go now
You better go, because
I like you much, too much There's the moon above
And it gives my heart a lot of swing
In your eyes there's love
And the way I feel it must be spring I want you so now
You have lips I love to touch
You better go now
You better go, because
I like you much, too much
You better go, because
I like you much, too much Billie holiday I love my man
On my life I say I don't I love my man
On my life I say I don't But I'll quit my man
On my life I say I won't
I've been your slave baby
Ever since I've been your way
I've been your slave
Ever since I've been your faith
But before I be your dog
I'll see you in your grave My man wouldn't give me no breakfast
Wouldn't give me no dinner
Squacked about my supper
Then he put me outdoors 
Heaven erred to late
A matchbox on my clothes
I didn't have so many
But I had a long long ways to go I ain't good looking
And my hair ain't curls
I ain't good looking
And my hair ain't curls But my mother she give me something
It's going to carry me through this world
Some man like me cause I'm happy
Some cause I'm snappy
Some call me honey
Others think I've got money
Some say billie
Baby you're built for speed
Now if you put that altogether
Makes me everything a good man needs Frank loesser / frederick hollander I'll forget your tender kiss
I'll be brave after this kiss
I'll say "hello my darling"
It we should meet again You'll forbid the tears to slip
You'll behave, bite your lip
And say "hello my darling"
If we should meet again If we do meet again
Our moments can't be sweet again
Oh my love, go my love
Though it's a bitter pill, I know my love Please remember not to sigh
Over this last goodbye
Just say "hello my darling"
If we should meet again Peter Tinturin / Jack Lawrence (tell accompanist that this wher you start instead of lyrics used by others) I tell myself "I'm through with you
And I'll having nothing more to do with love"
I stay away, but every day
I'm just foolin myself Tell my friends that I don't care
I shrug my shoulders at the whole affair
But all know it is't so
I'm just foolin myself (repeat) And ev'ry time I pass
And see my face in a looking glass
I tip my hat and say
"How do you do, you fool
You're trowing your life away"
I'm acting gay
I'm acting proud
And every time I see you in a crowd
I may pretend
But in the end
I'm just foolin myself You've got me on the road runnin' to and fro
Lookin' high and low
I don't know if I'm coming or going
Since I fell for you I run across the town chasing up and down
Having you around
I don't know if I'm coming or going
Since I fell for you You're so sincere
Keeping up with all you're love up there
I'm so dizzy
I've got trouble, I'm feeling double Just when I think you're through chasing as you do
You find someone new
I don't know if I'm coming or going
Since I fell for you When I found you
I found Heaven right before my door
Since I loved you
I've got trouble, I'm feeling double Why did you let me fly way up to the sky
Just to say goodbye
I don't know if I'm coming or going
Since I fell for you When the moon's kinda dreamy Starry eyed and dreamy
And nights are luscious and long
If you're kinda lonely
and all by your ownly
Then nothin' but the blues are brewin'
The blues are brewin' When the wind through the window
Blows across your pillow
And tells you sleepin' is wrong
If love goes a thirsting
Till you feel like bursting
Then nothing but the blues are brewin'
The blues are brewin' Suppose you want somebody
But you ain't got nobody
You only get a gleam in your eyes
Till somebody's found you
And put their lovin' arms around you
You got the feelin' you want to die But when the lord up above you
Send's someone to love you
The blues are something you loose
You're so busy doing
The things that you're doing
That love ain't got no time
For brewin' the blues You must remember this
a kiss is still a kiss
a sigh is just a sigh
the fundamental things apply
as time goes by
and when two lovers woo
they still say i love you
on that you can rely
no matter what the future brings
as time goes by
Moonlight and lovesongs
never out of date
hearts filled with passion
jealousy and hate
woman needs man
and man must have his mate
that no one can deny
it's still the same old story
a fight for love and glory
a case of do or die
though i will always welcome lovers
as time goes by
Moonlight and lovesongs
never out of date
hearts filled with passion
jealousy and hate
woman needs man
and man must have his mate
that no one can deny
it's still the same old story
a fight for love and glory
a case of do or die
though i will always welcome lovers
as time goes by I'm travelin' light because my man has gone
So from now on, I'm Travelin' Light
He said, "Goodbye", and took my heart away
So from today, I'm Travelin' Light No one to see, I'm free as the breeze
No one but me and my memories
Some lucky night he may come back again
So until then, I'm Travelin' Light No one to see, I'm free as the breeze
No one but me and my memories
Some lucky night he may come back again
So until then, I'm Travelin' Light Billie holiday / mal waldron Where's the love that's made to fill my heart?
Where's the one from whom I'll never part?
First they hurt me, then desert me
I'm left alone, all alone There's no house that I can call my home
There's no place from which I'll never roam
Town or city, it's a pity
I'm left alone, all alone Seek and find they always say
But up to now it's not that way
Maybe fate has let him pass me by
Or perhaps we'll meet before I die
Hearts will open, but until then I'm left alone, all alone I don't know why but I'm feeling so sad
I long to try something I never had
Never had no kissin'
Oh, what I've been missin'
Lover man, oh, where can you be? The night is cold and I'm so all alone
I'd give my soul just to call you my own
Got a moon above me
But no one to love me
Lover man, oh, where can you be? I've heard it said
That the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream
I go to bed with a prayer
That you'll make love to me
Strange as it seems Someday we'll meet
And you'll dry all my tears
Then whisper sweet
Little things in my ear
Hugging and a-kissing
Oh, what I've been missing
Lover man, oh, where can you be? Alec Wilder I'll be around no matter how you treat me now,
I'll be around from now on.
Your latest love can never last,
And when it's past, I'll be around when she's gone. Goodbye again and if you find a love like mine,
Just now and then drop a line
to say you're feeling fine.
And when things go wrong,
perhaps you'll see you're meant for me,
So, I'll be around when she's gone. Do you know what it means
To miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong The feeling's getting stronger
The longer I stay away
Miss the moist covered vines
The tall sugar pines Where mocking birds used to sing
And I'd like to see the lazy Mississippi
A hurrying into spring The Mardi Gras memories
Of creole tunes that filled the air
I dream of oleanders in June
And soon I'm wishing that I was there Do you know what it means
To miss New Orleans
When that's where you left your heart
And there's something more
I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans Please keep me in your dreams
In your sweet dreams let me hold you
When through your window
The breeze comes swingin'
It's just bringin' this love song that I'm singin' Please keep me in your dreams
My kiss it seems must have told you
My heart you'll borrow until tomorrow
So please keep me in your dreams Please keep me in your dreams
In your sweet dreams let me hold you
When through your window
The breeze comes swingin'
It's just bringin' this love song that I'm singin' Please keep me in your dreams
My kiss it seems must have told you
My heart you'll borrow until tomorrow
So please keep me in your dreams Oh every time it rains
it rains pennies from heaven
don't you know each cloud contains
pennies from heaven
you'll find your fortune
fallin' all over town
be sure that your umbrella is upside down
trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
it you want the things you love
you must have showers
so when you hear it thunder
don't run under a tree
there'll be pennies from heaven
for you and me
The world was bright when you loved me
sweet was the touch of your lips
the world went dark when you left me
and then there came a total eclipse
nobody knows how cruel fate can be
how close together love and hate can be
goodbye, just clean the slate for me
that's life i guess This year's crop of kisses
Don't seem as sweet to me
This year's crop just misses
What kisses used to be
This year's new romance
Doesn't seem to have a chance
Even helped by Mr. Moon above
This year's crop of kisses is not for me
For I'm still wearin' last year's love 
 (D. Roberts/E. Gold) If practice makes perfect
Let's try that old embrace
In some romantic place
Where we can take out time If practice makes perfect
Just close you eyes again
We'll try those sights again
And make them more sublime We're in love's kindergarden Learning from a to z
And if it's fun just starting
Think what it's going to be If practice makes perfect
Let's have that kiss again
We must'n miss again
We're not doing bad right now We're not doing bad
Let's practice some more
We're not doing bad right now You turned the tables on me
And now I'm falling for you
You turned the tables on me
I can't believe that it's true I always thought when you brought
The lovely present you bought
Why hadn't you brought me more
But now if you'd come
I'd welcome anything
From the five and ten cent store You used to call me the top
You put me up on a throne
You let me fall with a drop
And now I'm out on my own
But after thinking it over and over
I got what was coming to me
Just like the sting of a bee
You turned the tables on me (bridge) You used to call me the top
You put me up on a throne
You let me fall with a drop
And now I'm out on my own
But after thinking it over and over
I got what was coming to me
Just like the sting of a bee
You turned the tables on me John Klenner / Samuel M. Lewis Just friends
Lovers no more
Just friends
But not like before
To think of what we've been
And not to kiss again
Seems like pretending
It isn't the ending
Two friends
Drifting apart
Two friends
But one broken heart
We loved we laughed we cried
Then suddenly love died
The story ends
And we're
Just friends
We loved we laughed and we cried
Then suddenly love died
The story ends
And we're
Just friends Arthur Freed / Gus Arnheim / Abe Lyman I cried for you
Now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you
What a fool I used to be
Now I've found two eyes
Just a little bit bluer
I've found a heart
Just a little bit truer
I cried for you
Now it's your turn to cry over me Victor p. young / bing crosby / ned washington I need your love so badly
I love you oh so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you
I thought at last I found you
But other loves surround you
And I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you
If you'd surrender
Just for a tender
Kiss or two 
You might discover
That I'm the lover
Meant for you
And I'd be true
But what's the good of scheming
I'm dreaming
For I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you
'cause I don't stand
A ghost of a chance
With you any old time you want me
I am yours for the asking darling
any old time you need me
I'll be there with love that's lasting darling.
all through the years we'll stand together
sharing the tears and stormy weather
and the sunshine will be yours and mine
any old time you're blue
you'll have our love to chase away the blues
and any old thing you do I'll see you through.
so just remember that U am waiting dear
if ever you want me I'll be near,
any old time and any place you may be.

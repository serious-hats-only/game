So long sweet summer
(So long sweet summer)
I stumbled upon you and gratefully basked in your rays
So long sweet slumber
(So long sweet slumber)
I fell into you, now you're gracefully falling away
Hey thanks, thanks for that summer
It's cold where you're going
I hope that your hearts always warm
(Hope that your hearts always warm)
I gave you the best, I gave you the best that I had
(Gave the best I had)
Passed down the letters and passed down the best that I had
(Passed the best I had)
So long sweet summer
(So long sweet summer)
I stumbled upon you and gratefully basked in your rays
So long sweet slumber
(So long sweet slumber)
I fell into you, now you're gracefully falling away
I hate the winter in Lexington
I hate the winter in Lexington
Lexington, Lexington, Lexington
We watch the season pull up its own stakes
And catch the last weekend of the last week
Before the gold and the glimmer have been replaced
Another sun soaked season fades away
You have stolen my heart
You have stolen my heart
Invitation only grand farewells
Crash the best one of the best ones
Clear liquor and cloudy eyed, too early to say goodnight
You have stolen my heart
You have stolen my heart
And from the ballroom floor we are in celebration
One good stretch before our hibernation
Our dreams assured and we all will sleep well, sleep well
Sleep well
Sleep well
Sleep well
You have stolen (my)
You have stolen (my)
You have stolen my heart
I watch you spin around in your highest heels
You are the best one of the best ones
We all look like we feel
You have stolen my
You have stolen my
You have stolen my heart
Breathe in for luck
Breathe in so deep
This air is blessed
You share with me
This night is wild
So calm and dull
These hearts they race
From self control
Your legs are smooth
As they graze mine
We're doing fine
We're doing nothing at all
My hopes are so high
That your kiss might kill me
So won't you kill me
So I die happy
My heart is yours to fill or burst
To break or bury
Or wear as jewelry
Whichever you prefer
The words are hushed
Let's not get busted
Just lay entwined here
Undiscovered
Safe in here from
All those stupid questions
"Hey did you get some?"
Man, that is so dumb
Stay quiet
Stay near
Stay close, they can't hear
So we can get some
My hopes are so high
That your kiss might kill me
So won't you kill me
So I die happy
My heart is yours to fill or burst
To break or bury
Or wear as jewelry
Whichever you prefer
Hands down this is the best day I can ever remember
I'll always remember the sound of the stereo
The dim of the soft lights
The scent of your hair
That you twirled in your fingers
And the time on the clock
When we realized it's so late
And this walk that we shared together
And the streets were wet
And the gate was locked
So I jumped it
And I let you in
And you stood at your door
With your hands on my waist
And you kissed me
Like you meant it
And I knew
That you meant it
That you meant it
That you meant it
And I knew
That you meant it
That you meant it
Hope dangles on a string
like slow spinning redemption.
Winding in and winding out
the shine of it has caught my eye.
And roped me in
so mesmerizing
so hypnotizing.
I am captivated, I am
Vindicated, I am selfish
I am wrong, I am right.
I swear I'm right, swear
I knew it all along.
And I am flawed
but I am cleaning up so well.
I am seeing in me now
the things you swore, you saw yourself.
So clear like the diamond in your ring
cut to mirror your intention.
Over sized and overwhelmed
the shine of which has caught my eye.
And rendered me
so isolated
so motivated.
I am certain now that I am
Vindicated, I am selfish
I am wrong, I am right
I swear I'm right, swear
I knew it all along.
And I am flawed
but I am cleaning up so well.
I am seeing in me now
the things you swore, you saw yourself.
So turn up the corners of your lips
Part them and feel my finger tips
Trace the moment fall forever.
Defense is paper thin.
Just one touch and I'll be in
Too deep now to ever swim
against the current.
So let me slip away, so let me slip away
So let me slip away, so let me slip against the current.
So let me slip away, so let me slip away
So let me slip away, so let me slip away.
Vindicated, I am selfish
I am wrong, I am right.
I swear I'm right, swear
I knew it all along.
And I am flawed
but I am cleaning up so well.
I am seeing in me now
the things you swore, you saw yourself.
Slight hope dangles on a string
Like slow spinning redemption
So long sweet summer
(So long sweet summer)
I stumbled upon you and gratefully basked in your rays
So long sweet slumber
(So long sweet slumber)
I fell into you, now you're gracefully falling away
Hey thanks, thanks for that summer

Slight hope dangles on a string
Like slow spinning redemption
come on home and let yourself heal
you could sleep for a thousand years
and i wont let you disappear
let your heart beat here.
you've been running far and wide
doing what you hope is right
chasing what you feel inside
well i will take your path as mine
i feel it in my ribs
i feel it in my soul
the pulse just grows
so loud and so clear
let your heart beat here
let your heart beat here
winters come to take me away
i wear my ring to know what's at stake
and when the days work at their own pace
you'll remain my time and place
i feel it in my ribs
i feel it in my soul
the pulse just grows
so loud and so clear
let your heart beat here
let your heart beat here
we found our way past our youthful fears
and fought our way through the pain and tears
and we drove our stakes in the place most dear
and let our hearts beat here
i feel it in my ribs
i feel it in my soul
the pulse just grows
so loud and so so clear
let your heart beat here
so loud and so clear
let your heart beat here
let your heart beat here
let your heart beat here
[Verse 1]
We were the kids that left home probably too young
But we took our share and maybe then some
Tired of beatings and battles and being sewn up
But that made us grow up, and that made 'em scared
[Pre-Chorus]
Cause we never learned to keep our voices down
No, we only learned to shout
So we fight our way in
And we fight our way out
And we earned what we could from the ground up
And tried to lift the whole damn crowd up
So we fight our way in
And we fight our way out
[Chorus]
We fight our way in
And we fight our way out
We fight our way in
And we fight our way out
[Verse 2]
And there's still a kid somewhere that needs to hear this
That somebody cares, that somebody knows
Who's tired of bleeding and battered and being torn up
Just pick yourself up, it's time to go
[Pre-Chorus]
Cause we never learned to keep our voices down
No, we only learned to shout
So we fight our way in
And we fight our way out
And we earned what we could from the ground up
And tried to lift the whole damn crowd up
So we fight our way in
And we fight our way out
[Chorus]
We fight our way in
And we fight our way out
We fight our way in
And we fight our way out
[Bridge]
Maybe we found a way to make some tracks
We didn't snicker and turn our backs
We just keep digging in, and digging in, and giving back
[Pre-Chorus]
Cause we never learned to keep our voices down
No, we only learned to shout
So we fight our way in
And we fight our way out
And we earned what we could from the ground up
And tried to lift the whole damn crowd up
So we fight our way in
And we fight our way out
Cause we never learned to keep our voices down
No, we only learned to shout
So we fight our way in
And we fight our way out
[Chorus]
We fight our way in
And we fight our way out
We fight our way in
And we fight our way out
I'm missing your bed
I never sleep
Avoiding the spots where we'd have to speak
And this bottle of beast
Is taking me home
I'm cuddling close
To blankets and sheets
But you're not alone,
and you're not discreet
Make sure I know who's taking you home
I'm reading your note over again
And there's not a word that I comprehend
Except when you signed it
I will love you always and forever
Well as for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs
And sit alone and wonder
How you're making out
But as for me, I wish that I was anywhere, with anyone
Making out
I'm missing your laugh
How did it break?
And when did your eyes begin to look fake?
I hope you're as happy as you're pretending
I'm cuddling close, To blankets and sheets
And I am alone, In my defeat
I wish I knew you were safely at home
I'm missing your bed
I never sleep
Avoiding the spots where we'd have to speak
And this bottle of beast is taking me home
Well as for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs
And sit alone and wonder
How you're making out
But as for me, I wish that I was anywhere, with anyone
Making out
Your hair, it's everywhere
Screaming infidelities
And taking its wear
Your hair, it's everywhere
Screaming infidelities
And taking its wear
Your hair is everywhere
Screaming infidelities
And taking its wear
Your hair, it's everywhere
Screaming infidelities
And taking its wear
The sky glows
I see it shining when my eyes close
I hear your warnings but we both know
I'm gonna look at it again
Don't wait, don't wait
The road is now a sudden sea
And suddenly, you're deep enough
To lay your armor down
To lay your armor down
To lay your armor down
Well you get one look
I'll show you something that the knife took
A bit too early for my own good
Now let's not speak of it again
Don't wait, don't wait
The road is now a sudden sea
And suddenly, you're deep enough
To lay your armor down
To lay your armor down
To lay your armor down
Don't wait, don't wait
The lights will flash and fade away
The days will pass you by
Don't wait
To lay your armor down
To lay your armor down
To lay your armor down
To lay your armor down
To lay your armor down
Goddamn you half-Japanese girls
Do it to me every time
Oh, the redhead said you shred the cello
And I'm jello, baby
You won't talk, won't look, won't think of me
I'm the epitome of Public Enemy
Why you wanna go and do me like that?
Come down on the street and dance with me
I'm a lot like you so please
Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting
I think I'd be good for you
And you'd be good for me
I asked you to go to the Green Day concert
You said you never heard of them
How cool is that?
So I went to your room and read your diary:
"Watching Grunge leg-drop New-Jack through a press table..."
And then my heart stopped: "Listening to Cio-Cio San
Fall in love all over again."
I'm a lot like you so please
Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting
I think I'd be good for you
And you'd be good for me
How stupid is it? I can't talk about it
I gotta sing about it and make a record of my heart
How stupid is it? Won't you give me a minute
Just come up to me and say hello to my heart
How stupid is it?
For all I know you want me too
And maybe you just don't know what to do
Or maybe you're scared to say: "I'm falling for you"
I wish I could get my head out of the sand
'Cause I think we'd make a good team
And you would keep my fingernails clean
But that's just a stupid dream that I won't realize
'Cause I can't even look in your eyes
Without shakin', and I ain't fakin'
I'll bring home the turkey if you bring home the bacon.
I'm a lot like you so please
Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting
I think I'd be good for you
And you'd be good for me
I'm a lot like you.
I'm a lot, and I'm waitin.
I think I'd be good for you
And you'd be good for me.
she said, "i've gotta be honest,
you're wasting your time if you're fishing round here. "
and i said, "you must be mistaken,
i'm not fooling... this feeling is real."
she said, "you've gotta be crazy,
What do you take me for? Some kind of easy mark? "
you've got wits, you've got looks,
you've got passion, but I swear that you've got me all wrong.
all wrong.

but you got me...
i'll be true, i'll be useful...
i'll be cavalier... i'll be yours my dear.
and i'll belong to you...
if you'll just let me through.
this is easy as lovers go,
so don't complicate it by hesitating.
and this is wonderful as loving goes,
this is tailor-made, what's the sense in waiting?
and i said, "i've gotta be honest.
i've been waiting for you all my life.,
for so long i thought i was asylum bound.
but just seeing you makes me think twice.
and being with you here makes me sane,
i fear i'll go crazy if you leave my side.
you've got wits... you've got looks,
you've got passion but are you brave enough to leave with me tonight?"
tonight.

you've got me...
i'll be true, i'll be useful...

Hand out the window
Floatin' on air
Just a flip of the wrist
And I'd be wavin' you goodbye
Drive past the lifeguard stand
Where I sit around waiting for you to remember
(As I drive)
How the girls could turn to ghosts before your eyes
And the very dreams that led to them are keeping them from dying (keeping them)
And how the grace with which she walked into your life
Will stay with you in your steps,
And pace with you a while
So long, so long
So long, so long
The speaker in this door is blown
So nothing sounds quite right
(Taking my time
Taking this drive
Waving this town goodbye)
And I drive this ocean road
And remember
(The small of your back,
The nape of your neck
I remember everything)
As I drive,
Oh I'm waving this town goodbye
How the girls can turn to ghosts before your eyes
And the very dreams that led to them are keeping them from dying
And how the grace with which she walked into your life
Will stay with you in your steps,
Pace with you a while
So long, so long
So long, so long
So long, so long
(Taking my time,
Taking this drive
Waving this town goodbye)
And I will leave under the cover
Of summer's kiss upon the sky
Like the stone face of your lover
Just before she says goodbye
I was certain that the season could be held between my arms
But just as summer's hold is fleeting
I was here and now I'm gone
I'm gone...
On the way home, this car hears my confessions.
I think tonight I'll take the long way.
In this weather, the wind outside is biting.
It's left me feeling tired and exposed.
You've been asking me to bleed.
It seems these kinds of questions, they come too easy to you now.
And your lack of shame comes naturally.
I should not be surprised. I should have seen it sooner.
Expect me to apologize for things that you've done wrong.
But you're inciting others.
You're owning up to nothing and I wish that I was gone,
'cause you're not going anywhere.
And this damp air it's fighting my defroster.
My sighs they ring victorious and fog this tinted glass.
And it's clouded and so is my head.
The hint of these new tears are sharp I try to choke them back.
But it's useless. I am useless against them.
They are beating me with ease.
On the way home this car hears my confessions.
I think tonight I'll take the long way.
Expect me to apologize for things that you've done wrong.
While you're inciting others.
You're owning up to nothing and I wish that I was gone,
'Cause you're not going anywhere.
On the way home this car hears my confessions.
I think tonight I'll take the long way.
I've got my eye on top shelf liquor,
With taste so smooth it
Hits you quicker.
But you've only got the well.
And I've got an eye for top tier women
With legs so long they go straight to heaven,
But this old bunch looks like hell.
But tonight I'll take what I can get.
I'd like to hear a great musician
With strange ideas and grand ambitions,
But this guy, he's got trouble with chords.
And I'd like to leave this game a winner
Head held high, the luck of beginners
But this old losers crawling out on all fours.
But tonight I'll take what I can get.
Well this drink will do,
And girl you look alright,
And this band is playing like hell tonight.
These dice are loaded
And Lord I am too
I might be losing but I'm leaving soon.
With the prettiest girl
To enter this dump,
She drank all of the whiskey but she left me the rum
And tonight I'll take what I can get
Tonight I'll take what I can get
I've got my sights on brand new beginnings
Brand new starts make saints of sinners
But I'm doomed to live in my past
Live nude girls says the sign out front,
But old dead dreams are dancing in front,
Of old dead dreamers with washed up luck,
Buyin' love for cash
Well tonight I'll take what I can get.
This old story gets stale and dry,
No matter how I try and try
To spin this fable
Fresh and new
You strung me along
Like a tease on prom night
Getting me loose but
Leaving me uptight
Please tell me that
Some of that love was true.
Tonight I'll take what I can get
Well this drink will do,
And girl you look alright,
And this band is playing like hell tonight.
These dice are loaded
And Lord I am too
But I might be losing but I'm scoring soon.
With the prettiest girl
To enter this dump,
She drank all of the whiskey but she left me the rum
And tonight I'll take what I can get.
Tonight I'll take what I can get
Well this drink will do
And girl you look alright
And this band is playin like hell tonight.
These dice are loaded and Lord I am too
I might be losing but I'm leaving soon
With the prettiest girl
To enter this dump
She drank all of the whisky but she left me the rum
And tonight I'll take what I can get
Tonight I'll take what I can get
Tonight I'll take what I can get
Tonight I'll take what I can get
She fixes her lips, they
always looks perfect...
Never a smudge line,
Never too much.
I try on my blue shirt...
She told me she liked it, once.
She wonders what I'll wear,
She knows just what she'll wear,
She always wears blue.
So sneakers or flipflops?
I'm starting to panic.
Remember she asked you,
"Remember to breathe,
And everything will be okay."
Okay... Okay...
Alright... Alright...
Alright... Alright...
Alright... Alright...
Save up until you've had it
The offer's come but you won't go on
Brought down with the force of nature
Breathing off my lungs
It's not easy to like it
(It's not easy to like it)
It's not easy at all
(It's not easy at all)
It's not easy to like it at all
Fill up to the limit
Winter's come with her appetite
Money clips equipped with paper
Buckets brimming and tied
It's not easy to like it
(It's not easy to like it)
It's not easy at all
(It's not easy at all)
It's not easy to like it at all
Breathing off of my lung
When you breathe off of my lung
Save up till you've had it
Offer's come but you won't go on
Brought down
(The forces of nature)
When you breathe
It's not easy to like it
It's not easy at all
It's breathing off of my lung
Which of the bold face lies will we use?
I hope that you're happy, you really deserve it
This'll be best for us both in the end
But your taste still lingers on my lips
Like I just placed them upon yours
And I starve, I starve for you but this new diets liquid
And dulling to the senses, and it's crude but it will do
So which of the standard lines will we use?
I've been meaning to call you, I've just been so busy
We'll catch up soon, let's make it a point to
But your taste still lingers on my lips
Like I just placed them upon yours
And I starve, I starve for you but this new diets liquid
And dulling to the senses, and it's crude but it will do
It will do, I hope it will do
There's things I know I should have mentioned sooner
But I didn't know how
I'm sorry I lost you
I never thought that this could come between us
I know its water and bridges now
But what's the sense in carrying around
This weight, these words are tearing me apart
And that's enough for the back to break
That's enough for a mouth to take
But I've been paying for it since I drove my girl away
And that's the sign of a solemn man
I'll make the best of the best I can
And I'll be better for it if I ever get my chance
That face, I know exactly what you're thinking
But I'm certain this time is different
And that's why I can't pretend that everything is mended
I know I've tried to for too long now
But what's the sense in carrying around
This weight, these words are tearing me apart
And that's enough for the back to break
That's enough for a mouth to take
But I've been paying for it since I drove my girl away
And that's the sign of a solemn man
I'll make the best of the best I can
And I'll be better for it if I ever get my chance
Oh save me from a grey life
Oh save me from a grey life
I paid the price with my soul
Oh save me
And that's enough for the back to break
That's enough for a mouth to take
But I've been paying for it since I drove my girl away
And that's the sign of a solemn man
I'll make the best of the best I can
And I'll be better for it if I ever get my chance
If I ever get my chance
If I ever get my chance
If I ever get my chance
Carve your heart out yourself
Hopelessness is your cell
Since you've drawn out these lines
Are you protected from trying times?
Man it takes a silly girl to lie about the dreams she has
Lord it takes a lonely one to wish that she had never dreamt at all
Oh Lord, now, there you go with hope again
Oh, you're so sure I'll be leaving in the end
Dig a ditch deep enough
To keep you clear of the sun
You've been burned more than once
You don't think much of trust
Man it takes a silly girl to lie about the dreams she has
Lord it takes a lonely one to wish that she had never dreamt at all
Oh Lord, now, there you go with hope again
But I'll be sure your secret is safe with me
Oh, you're so sure I'll be leaving in the end
Treating me like I'm already gone
But I'm not, I will stay where you are always
I will stay, I will stay, I will stay (all of now)
(repeat to fade out)
It's yet to be determined
but the air is thick
and my hope is feeling worn
i'm missing home
and i'm glad you're not a part of this
there's parts of me that will be missed
and the phone is always dead to me
so I can't tell you
the tempurature is dropping
and it feels like
it's colder than it oughta be in march
and i've still got a day or two ahead of me
till i'll be heading home
into your arms, again
and the people here are asking after you
it doesn't make it easier
it doesn't make it easier to be away
I'd like to hire a plane
and see you in the morning
when the day is fresh,
i'm coming home again
coming home again
coming home again
when the day is fresh,
i'm coming home again
well, it's warmer where you're waiting
it feels more like july
there's pillows in their cases
and one of those is mine
and you wrote the words, "I love you"
and sprayed it with perfume
it's better than the fire is
to heat this lonely room
it's warmer where you're waiting
it feels more like july
it feels more like july
and it's yet to be determined
but the air is thick
and my hope is feeling worn
I'm missing home
and i'm glad you're not a part of this
there's parts of me that will be missed
and the phone is always dead to me
so I can't tell you the tempurature is dropping
and it feels like
it's colder than it oughta be in march
and i've still got a day or two ahead of me
till i'll be heading home
into your arms, again
and the people here are asking after you
it doesn't make it easier
it doesn't make it easier to be away
I'd like to hire a plane
and see you in the morning
when the day is fresh,
i'm coming home again
i'm coming home again
i'm coming home again
when the day is fresh,
i'm coming home again
This is where I say I've had enough
no one should ever feel the way that I feel now.
A walking open wound, a trophy display of bruises
And I don't believe that I'm getting any better.
Any better.
Waiting here with hopes the phone will ring
And I'm thinking awful things
Pretty sure that few would notice.
And this apartment is starving for an argument.
Anything at all to break the silence.
Wandering this house like I've never wanted out
And this is about as social as I get now.
And I'm throwing away the letters that I am writing you
Cause they would never do, I would never do.
Never
Waiting here with hopes the phone will ring
And I'm thinking awful things
Pretty sure that few would notice.
And this apartment is starving for an argument.
Anything at all to break the silence.
Well don't be a liar,
Don't say that everything's working when everything's broken.
And you smile like a saint but you curse like a sailor
And you might say the jokes on me.
well I'm not laughing
You're not leaving
Who do I think I am kidding,
When I'm the only one locked in this cell.
Waiting here with hopes the phone will ring
And I'm thinking awful things
Pretty sure that few would notice.
And this apartment is starving for an argument.
Anything at all to break the silence.
So don't be a liar
Don't say that everything's working when everything's broken.
And you smile like a saint but you curse like a sailor
And you might say the jokes on me.
I'm always assuming the worst
But you're going on nonetheless
And there's nothing to cushion your heart led fall
Letters from further away
Keep pulling me close to home
And there's something to cushion my callous sighs
And I know that you hope for
Longer good-byes
Embracing for forever
And falling in your eyes
In your eyes
Your eyes
Pouring over photographs
I'm living in your letters
Breathe
Deeply from this envelope
It smells like you
And I can't be
Without that scent
It's filling me
With all you mean to me
To me
Continually failing these trials
But you stand by me nonetheless
And you won't let me sink
Though I'm begging you
I'm begging you
Phone calls from further away
And messages on my machine
But I don't ever tell you this distance
Seems terrible
And there's no need to test my heart
With useless space
These roads go on forever
There'll always be a place
For you
In my heart
So I'll hit the pavement
It's gotta be better than waiting
And pushing you far away
Cause I'm scared
So I'll take my chances
And head on my way up there
Cause turning to you is like falling in love when you're ten
So quiet, another wasted night
The television steals the conversation
Exhale another wasted breath
Again it goes unnoticed
Please tell me you're just feeling tired
'Cause if it's more than that I feel that I might break
Out of touch, out of time
Please send me anything but signals that are mixed
'Cause I can't read your rolling eyes
Out of touch, are we out of time?
Close lipped another goodnight kiss
Is robbed of all it's passion
Your grip another time is slack
It leaves me feeling empty
Please tell me you're just feeling tired
'Cause if it's more than that I feel that I might break
Out of touch, out of time
Please send me anything but signals that are mixed
'Cause I can't read your rolling eyes
Out of touch, are we out of time?
I'll wait until tomorrow, maybe you'll feel better then
Maybe we'll be better then
So what's another day when I can't bear
These nights of thoughts of going on without you
This mood of yours is temporary
It seems worth the wait to see your smile again
Out of the corner of my eye won't be the only way
Your looking at me then
So quiet, another wasted night
The television steals the conversation
Exhale another wasted breath
Again it goes unnoticed
The first time you looked
At her curves you were hooked
And the glances you took, took hold of you
And demanded that you stay
And sunk in their teeth
Bit you hard and released
Such a charge that you need
Another touch, another taste, another fix
She just might get you lost
And she just might leave you torn
But she just might save your soul
If she gets you and she gets you any closer
And she leads you up
Points out skylines and stars
Steeplechases and bars and took your keys
And demanded that you stay
The city longs well for rooftops and invitations
All lace and secret places
She moves you to touch with her hands
And she just might get you lost
(She just might get you lost)
And she just might leave you torn
(She just might leave you torn)
But she just might save your soul
If she gets you and she gets you any closer
Under the cool sheet where the welcome touch
Of skin and skin will meet
Hot on the inside, where the girl's prize
Is at the tip of your tongue
Where every move and each impulse
Brings clarity
To stay like this is everything
You'll ever need
She just might get you lost
And she just might leave you torn
But she just might save your soul
If she gets you any closer
And she just might get you lost
(She just might get you lost)
And she just might leave you torn
(She just might leave you torn)
But she just might save your soul
If she gets you any closer
(If she gets you any closer)
And she just might get you lost
(She just might get you lost)
And she just might leave you torn
(She just might leave you torn)
But she just might save your soul
If she gets you any closer
Can you believe your eyes?
You called to say you wanted out
Well, I can't say I blame you now
Sometimes you've got to fold before you're found out
Well thanks for waiting this long to show yourself
Cause now that I can see you
I don't think you're worth a second glance
So much for all the promises you made,
They served you well
Now you're gone and they're wasted on me
So much for your endearing sense of charm
It served you well
Now it's gone and you're wasted on me
You called to say you wanted out
Well, I can't say I blame you now
Sometimes you've got to fold before you're found out
Well thanks, thanks for waiting this long to show yourself
To show yourself
And now that I can see you
I don't think you're worth a second glance
So much for all the promises you made,
They served you well
Now you're gone and they're wasted on me
So much for your endearing sense of charm
It served you well
Now it's gone and you're wasted on me
I guess that all you've got
Is all you're gonna
So much for, so much more.
I guess that all you've got
Is all you're gonna get
So much for, so much more
Do what you must
If that's what you wish
I can't be a party to this
You have sense that you were born with
You'll find a way to make things right
I guess that all you've got
Is all you're gonna get
So much for, so much more (x3)
So quiet.
Another wasted night
The television steals the conversation.
Exhale.
Another wasted breath
again it goes unnoticed.
Please tell me you're just feeling tired,
cause if it's more than that I fear that I might break.
Out of touch. Out of time.
Please send me anything but signals that are mixed,
cause I can't read your rolling eyes.
Out of touch. Are we out of time?
Closed lipped
another goodnight kiss
is robbed of all its passion.
Your grip
another time to slack
has left me feeling empty
Please tell me you're just feeling tired,
cause if it's more than that I feel that I might break.
Out of touch. Out of time
Please send me anything but signals that are mixed,
cause I can't read your rolling eyes.
Out of touch. Are we out of time?
I'll wait until tomorrow.
Maybe you'll feel better then,
maybe we'll be better then.
So what's another day
when I can't bear these nights of thoughts of going on without you?
This mood of yours is temporary.
It seems worth the wait to see you smile again.
Out of the corner of my eye
won't be the only way you're looking at me then.
So quiet.
Another wasted night
the television steals the conversation.
Exhale.
Another wasted breath
again it goes unnoticed.
I heard about your trip
I heard about your souvenirs
I heard about the cool breeze and the cool nights
And the cool guys that you spent them with
I guess I should have heard of them from you
I guess I should have heard of them from you
Well don't you see, don't you see
That the charade is over
And all the "best deceptions" and the
"Clever cover story" awards go to you
So kiss me hard
'Cause this will be the last time that I let you
You will be back someday
And this awkward kiss that tells of other people's lips
Will be of service to keeping you away
I heard about your regrets
I heard that you were feeling sorry
I heard from someone that you wish you could
Set things right between us
Well, I guess I should have heard of that from you

So kiss me hard
'Cause this will be the last time that I let you
You will be back someday
And this awkward kiss that screams of other people's lips
Will be of service to keeping you away
To keeping you away
I'm waiting for blood to flow to my fingers
I'll be alright when my hands get warm
Ignoring the phone--I'd rather say nothing
I'd rather you never heard my voice
You're calling too late, too late to be gracious
You do not warrant long goodbyes
You're calling too late
You're calling too late
You're calling too late

Which of the bold faced lies will we use?
I hope that you're happy,
you really deserve it,
this will be the best for us both in the end.
But your taste still lingers on my lips
like I just placed them upon yours
and I starve
I starve for you.
But this new diet's liquid
and dulling to the senses.
And it's crude
but it will do.
Which of the standard lines will we use?
I've been meaning to call you.
I've just been so busy.
We'll catch up soon.
Let's make it a point to.
But your taste still lingers on my lips
like I just placed them upon yours
and I starve
I starve for you.
But this new diet's liquid
and dulling to the senses.
And it's crude
but it will do.
It will do.
I hope it will do.
She had a history of killing herself
I had a habit of dying
I think she gave me something to live for
I guess I helped her pass the time
And I had a vision of seeing things straight
She had the heart of a liar
I never saw her leave me once
She never felt me beside her
And it's cruel but she's got a good hold on me
(It's cruel but she's got a good hold on me)
And it's cruel but she's got a good hold on me
(It's cruel but she's got a good hold on me)
And it's cruel but she's got a good hold on me
(It's cruel but she's got a good hold on me)

It's yet to be determined
but the air is thick
and my hope is feeling worn
i'm missing home
and i'm glad you're not a part of this
there's parts of me that will be missed
and the phone is always dead to me
so I can't tell you
the tempurature is dropping and it feels like
it's colder than it oughta be in march
and i've still got a day or two ahead of me
till i'll be heading home
into your arms, again
and the people here are asking after you
it doesn't make it easier
it doesn't make it easier to be away
I'd like to hire a plane
and see you in the morning
when the day is fresh,
i'm coming home again
coming home again
coming home again
when the day is fresh,
i'm coming home again
well, it's warmer where you're waiting
it feels more like july
there's pillows in their cases
and one of those is mine
and you wrote the words, "I love you"
and sprayed it with perfume
it's better than the fire is
to heat this lonely room
it's warmer where you're waiting
it feels more like july
it feels more like july
and it's yet to be determined

Carry this picture for luck
Kept in a locket, tucked in your collar
Close to your chest, make it a secret
Shown to the closest friends
Meet me at quarter to seven
The sun will still shine then
At this time of year, we'll head to the inlet
And we'll share a bottle there
And color the coast with your smile
It's the most genuine thing
I've ever seen, I was so lost
But now I believe
And follow me south of the big docks
Where they tether the boats
The rich men revere, they're so important
They hire our fathers to steer
And down to the edge of the water
Where we'll spill our guts and we'll name our fears
I'll give you this picture
Keep it and don't be scared
And color the coast with your smile
Its the most genuine thing
I've ever seen, I was so lost
But now I believe
In the coast
Your smile is the most genuine thing
I've ever seen, I was so lost
But now I believe, now I believe
Now I believe, now I believe
I heard that you were home again,
but you don't look like you're back to me
with your focuses changing,
your gaze is transfixed
a point that i can't often see
you've got your new ties,
I've got my old knots,
you've got your inside lines
but you're never happy with what you've got
careful now
you're so beautiful
when you've convinced yourself
that no one else is quite as beautiful
I heard that you were living well,
but you don't look like you're living to me
though the sparkle is gone,
your smile is in place
so that everyone watching can see
you've got them all convinced
but I know it so well
that you could list your friends
but you can't count on them
hold it now
you've got everyone convinced
that you're alright
when no one else is quite as vulnerable
as soon as you got it you want something else
it's not the sale that you love it's the sell
it's not the price that going to cost you
it's just the weight that's going to bring you
down, down, down, down
it's going to bring you
down, down, down, down, down
repeat 2x
hold it now
you've got everyone convinced
that you're alright
noone else is quite as vulnerable
careful now
you're so beautiful
when you've convinced yourself
noone else is quite as beautiful (you're so beautiful)
as soon as you got it you want something else
it's not the sale that you love it's the sell
it's not the price that going to cost you
it's just the weight that's going to bring you
down, down, down, down
it's going to bring you
down, down, down, down, down(you're so beautiful)
as soon as you got it you want something else
it's not the sale that you love it's the sell
it's not the price that going to cost you
it's just the weight that's going to bring you,
down...
I was away for a while
But I'm hoping someday you'll forgive me
But I don't deserve it
I'll cherish it well if you give me
One of your new starts
Just one more last chance
I swear that I'll earn it
If you front me for now
I'm good for it I swear
I'm better now I swear
In earlier days
They'd persecute people
They'd carry them off
And hobble their legs
For lesser offences
Than how I have harmed you
But still you allow me
To walk free of pain
Though I punish myself
I will never settle
The debts I've incurred
For scorning the face
Of absolute beauty
And measureless grace
And though I once mocked you
I'm dying to pay for it now.
I'm dying to pay for it now.
So hand me the rocks
To help weigh me down
And tether my legs with a cord tightly bound to the
End of an anchor
Thrown in to the sound
And test me to see
If I
Will rise
Against
The worst
That it
Can get.
I wasn't well for a while
I savor the things that I knew
Were sure to destroy me
And that seemed to hold me
That seemed to carry me where I couldn't go
On the strength of my own
But I should've known
That that gets me nowhere
I've learned that now I swear
I earlier days
They'd persecute people
They'd carry them off
And hobble their legs
For lesser offences
Than how I have harmed you
But still you allow me
To walk free of pain
Though I punish myself
I will never settle
The debts I've incurred
For scorning the face
Of absolute beauty
And measureless grace
And though I once mocked you
I'm dying to pay for it now.
I'm dying to pay for it now
Now
Now
So hand me the rocks
To help weigh me down
And tether my legs with a cord tightly bound
To the end of an anchor
Thrown in to the sound
And test me to see
If I
Will rise
Against
The worst
That it
Can get.
Well I wasn't sure that I could
Well I wasn't sure that I could
Well I wasn't sure that I could
But I can.
Taste
I love the taste
I need its warm rush
Rush
I need the rush
To pulse through my veins
And I'll love you tonight
Oh I love you tonight
And tomorrow you may just
Feel the same
Please don't bite down
I will know I'm alive
Rush
There is no rush
There is no reason
To blush
There's only us
To keep it between
And I'll love you tonight
I will love you tonight
And tomorrow we may just feel the same
And I won't bite down
'Til the moment counts
And I'll know I'm alive
And I'll know I'm alive
Give me some teeth
Give me something
Unforgettable
And I'll know I'm alive
And I'll know I'm alive
And I'll know I'm alive
And the moment's right
And I'll know I'm alive
And I'll know I'm alive
Give me some teeth
Give me something
Unforgettable
And I'll know I'm alive
And I'll know I'm alive
And I'll know that I am alive
How can you ask for forgiveness?
So now you think that your crimes are victimless?
I know you and your sins
Your retributions
So how will you lay your penance down?
We all pay in time
So how will you clear you conscience
When your clock unwinds?
I've heard enough of your forked tongue
How do you know when the cuts are deep enough?
I know you like your stabs
Your preemptive attacks
But how will you hold your demons down?
We're all judged in time
But how can you seek redemption
Using alibis?
You out to know better,
Than to bait your jailor
You ought to know
You ought to know better
How do you deal with the consequence?
Now that we bear the weight of your arrogance
I know you and your cons
Your petty little bombs
But who will you blame your troubles on now?
We all pay in time
So how will you clear your conscience
When your lies unwind?
You ought to know better,
Than to bait your jailor
You ought to know better,
Than to test your luck
You ought to know better,
Than to bite who feeds ya'
You ought to know
You ought to know better
How can you ask for forgiveness?
How can you think that your crimes are victimless?
I know you and your sins
Your retributions
So how will you lay your penance down?
We're all judged in time
So how will you clear your conscience
When your lies unwind
I know that yesterday is gone and it won't come back to me
But I miss it after all it never really lasts as long as we meant for it to be
There'll be twists and turns, they're pulling us and tearing to the seams
But I'll meet you where we started once again, cause I miss you
Maybe we were right to carry on, to carry on
Even when they said we'd be undone
Take it as a sign we can still go on, we still belong
Even when the worst is yet to come
We're only waiting on the sun to clear away the haze
Cause we can't see where we've gone from where we started
Where we strayed and where we're meant to be
There'll be ash and dust to bury us but I will keep you clean
And I'll meet you where we started once again
Maybe we were right to carry on, to carry on
Even when they said we'd be undone
Take it as a sign we can still go on, we still belong
Even when the worst is yet to come
And when tomorrow comes and we've shown everyone
What they can never take away
Maybe we were right to carry on, to carry on
Even when they said we'd be undone
Take it as a sign we can still go on, we still belong
Even when the best is yet to come
And when tomorrow comes and we've shown everyone
What they can never take away
Well I'm back from the road,
And you're out on it,
And I'm tired of this distance,
And I believe it's over,
It's over
I'm waiting..
And this phone tag game is endless,
The novelty is wearing,
I'm hoping time will pass,
Without any assistance or convincing
Road rules apply,
There's so much action
You're getting busy,
So I'll call you're cellular phone,
To tell you tv night was,
Lonely without you,
And so am I,
So am I
It seems our day keeps falling on a Leap Year
So many high points on this last leg,
I can't wait to recount them,
It seems like nothing's happened until I've shared them with you,
And the note that you have called,
Says that you're half a day away,
And you're heading home,
Just in time for me,
For me,
To leave
And road rules apply
There's so much action
I'm getting busy,
So make sure that I'm up to date on tv night,
I hate to miss out,
I think I miss you most,
On Wednesdays and Saturdays,
Seems our day keeps falling on a leap year
Oh love, hang on,
I've gotta say this right
'Cause I only get one shot,
Once in my life
'Cause I want to grow old with you
And I want you to hold me forever
Do you think that you love me?
'Cause I do, I do, I do
Do you want that forever?
'Cause I do, I do, I do
Do you want me to share your life with you?
I do, I do, I do
Oh love, hang on,
If you're willing,
I'll be strong
And I'll give you the life that you deserve
'Cause I want you to know all of me
And I, I want to hold you forever
Do you think that you love me?
'Cause I do, I do, I do
Do you want that forever?
'Cause I do, I do, I do
Do you want me to brave this world for you?
I do, I do, I do
I do, I do, I do, I do
I made my slow way home
Limping on broken bones
Out of the thickest pine
Across the county lines
On to your wooden stairs
I know you can repair
I know you've seen the light
I know you'll get me right
Right
Right
Right
I own a sinners heart
I know the rain falls hard
I know the currency
I know the things you'll need
I hope he hears my prayers
I see you cut your hair
I know the saving type
I know you'll get me right
Right
Right
Right
But, Jesus I've fallen
I don't mind the rain if
I meet my maker
I'll meet my maker clean
But, Jesus the truth is
I've struggled so hard to believe
I'll meet my maker
I'll need my maker
To cure of my doubting blood
And drain me of the sins I love
And take from me my disbelief
I know it should come easily
But it remains inside of me
It battles and devours me
It cuddles up the side of me
And whispers it convinces me I'm
Right
Right
Right
Right
Right
Right
Right
Right
Right
Right
Right
Don't act like you've been silent
I know how you spread that
Web of contradictions
Wide like so much cover fire
Keep watch for the mines
Keep watch for the mines
Be careful who you
Wave that tongue at 'round here
I've seen smarter acts than yours
Get disappeared
If you keep swinging that knife
All over this town
You are bound
To get you own back stabbed
Keep watch for the mines
The concealed dangers
The traps and the coils of the wires
With the sharp razors
The ditches and the trenches and the smiles
Of the grave diggers
And if you're told
The answer needs no questioning
The answer is a lie
Keep watch for the mines
Keep watch for the mines
Will they bleed everyone out?
Will they bleed everyone out?
Keep watch for the mines
Will they bleed everyone out
Before they die?
Keep watch for the mines
Keep watch for the mines
Will they bleed everyone out?
Will they bleed everyone out?
Keep watch for the mines
Will they bleed everyone out
Before they die?
Keep watch for the mines
The concealed dangers
The traps and the coils of the wires
With the sharp razors
The ditches and the trenches and the smiles
Of the grave diggers
And if you're told
The answer needs no questioning
The answer is a lie
Keep watch for the mines
Keep watch for the mines
Down in a local bar out on the Boulevard
The sound of an old guitar
Is saving you from sinking
It's a long way down, it's a long way
Back like you never broke, you tell a dirty joke
He touches your leg and thinks he's getting close
For now you let him
Just this once, just for now, and just like that it's over
Don't turn away, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Don't be afraid, but keep it all inside, all inside
When you fall apart, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Life is always hard for the Belle of the Boulevard
In all your silver rings, in all your silken things
That song you softly sing
Is keeping you from breaking
It's a long way down, it's a long way
Back here you never lost, you shake the shivers off
You take a drink to get your courage up
Can you believe it?
Just this once, just for now, and just like that it's over
Don't turn away, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Don't be afraid, oh keep it all inside, all inside
When you fall apart, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Life is always hard for the Belle of the Boulevard
Please hold on, it's alright
Please hold on, it's alright
Please hold on
Down in a local bar out on the boulevard
The sound of an old guitar
Is saving you
Don't turn away, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Don't be afraid, but keep it all inside, all inside
When you fall apart, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Life is always hard, let me dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Don't turn turn away
Let me dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Don't be afraid, but keep it all inside, all inside
When you fall apart, let me dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Life is always hard for the Belle of the Boulevard
The signal is subtle
We pass just close enough to touch
No questions, no answers
We know by now to say enough
With only simple words
With only subtle turns
The things we feel alone for one another
There is a secret that we keep
I won't sleep if you won't sleep
Because tonight may be the last chance we'll be given
We are compelled to do what we must do
We are compelled to do what we have been forbidden
So I won't sleep if you won't sleep tonight
Our act of defiance
We keep this secret in our blood
No paper or letters
We pass just close enough to touch
We love in secret names
We hide within our veins
The things that keep us bound to one another
There is a secret that we keep
I won't sleep if you won't sleep
Because tonight may be the last chance we'll be given
We are compelled to do what we must do
We are compelled to do what we have been forbidden
Until the last trace and this hope
Is frozen deep inside my bones
And this broken fate has claimed me
And my memories for its own
Your name is pounding through my veins
Can't you hear how it is sung?
And I can taste you in my mouth
Before the words escape my lungs
And I'll whisper only once...
There is a secret that we keep
I won't sleep if you won't sleep
Because tonight may be the last chance we'll be given
We are compelled to do what we have to
We are compelled to do what we have been forbidden
'Cause you will be somebody's girl
And you will keep each other warm
But tonight I am feeling cold
Oh all right dear
Have a nice year
Teach the mean girls
How to be feared
And turn the weak ones
Into servants
You can't be satisfied
You just want what you can't have
Oh no, not again
The shudders, the shaking
Oh no, not again
The faint and the faking
Oh no, oh no, love
It's not what you're thinking
I've just had enough at finishing school
Oh all right love
Here's the good stuff
You can have it if you want it
But you want what you can't have
Oh no, not again
The shudders, the shaking
Oh no, not again
The faint and the faking
Oh no, oh no, love
It's not what you're thinking
I've just had enough of your finishing school
Even now I can smell your clothes
Freshly from the wash,
Still hot from the dryer.
Even now I can smell your skin
As I wrap you in a towel,
Lay you on the bed, and try to love you
Even now I can feel your arms.
I can feel your breasts.
I can hear your songs.
And I always can find you again.
Even now I can feel your hand
Gently over mine,
With almost no weight at all.
Even now I can feel your eyes.
Watch me as I strum
Much too late at night.
Even now I can see you smile.
I can hear you hum.
I can hear you sing.
And I always can find you again.
Even in the dark of night.
Even in the lowest light.
Even as the world outside is spinning,
And spinning
Even now I can feel your hair
Blow across my cheek
As we sit in one of two chairs.
Even now I can feel your face
Resting on my chest,
Wrestling for sleep and failing at it.
Even now I can see you sleep.
I can see you dream.
I can see you fly.
And I always can find you again.
And I always can find you again.
The air is visible around you, rising up
And off your lips in slow currents, and I watch
As your face is framed in its slow currents, drifting curls
A trailin' path, a long draft becomes a tress of blue ash
If it is born in flames then we should let it burn
Burn as brightly as we can
And if it? s got to end then let it end in flames
Let it burn all the way down
The air is visceral around us
Turning in its simple steps on slow currents
And I watch as it pirouettes and spins in slow motion
A long drag becomes a slow dance in a halo of ember
If it is born in flames then we should let it burn
Burn as brightly as we can
And if it? s got to end then let it end in flames
Let it burn all the way down
All the way down
And if this is ever meant to end
Then I hope it ends where it began
So hot with love, we burned our hands
If this is ever meant to end
Then I hope it ends where it began
So hot with love, it burns our hands
If it is born in flames then we should let it burn
Burn as brightly as we can
And if it's got to end then let it end in flames
Let it burn
(Let it burn)
If it? s got to end
(Let it burn)
If it? s got to end
(Let it burn)
It ends where it began
So hot with love, it burns our hands
Well I know the trouble when the trouble starts.
I know the signals of a straying heart.
I know the stirrings of a double-cross.
I see suspicions arise around you.
I know the chatter as it starts to creep.
I know the walls as they ring and repeat.
I know the secrets they were meant to keep.
I see suspicions arise.
It's a shame, I know, but it all shakes out real slow
When the follies of your weekend hang like smoke onto your clothes.
And the shame of it grows when you whisper it nice and low.
But all the walls have ears my darling, and all bad things get known.
And I know about you. I know about you.
I know the ceiling when it starts to burn.
I know the season when it starts to turn.
And I know that the patterns that the wicked learn.
And I see suspicions arise around you.
I know the curtain and the way it falls.
I know the burden and the pain it draws.
I know you're sorry for something,
But I don't know why.
It's a shame, I know, but it all shakes out real slow
When the follies of your weekend hang like smoke onto your clothes.
And the shame of it grows when you whisper it nice and low (whisper it nice and low).
But all the walls have ears my darling, and all bad things get known.
And I know about you (I know about you). I know about you.
It's a shame, I know, but it all shakes out real slow

And I know about you. I know about you (I know about you).
I know about you (I know about you). I know about you.
She smiled in a big way, the way a girl like that smiles
When the world is hers and she held your eyes
Out in the breezeway down by the shore in the lazy summer
And she pulled you in, and she bit your lip, and she made you hers
She looked deep into you as you lay together quiet in the grasp of dusk and summer
But you've already lost
When you only had barely enough to hang on
And she combed your hair, and she kissed your teeth
And she made you better than you'd been before
She told you bad things you wished you could change in the lazy summer
And she told you, laughing down to her core, so she would not cry as she lay in your lap
She said "nobody here can live forever, quiet in the grasp of dusk and summer"
But you've already lost
When you only had barely enough to hang on
She said, "no one is alone the way you are alone"
And you held her looser than you would have if you ever could have known
Some things tie your life together, slender threads and things to treasure
Days like that should last and last and last
But you've already lost
When you only had barely enough of her to hang on
Slip out the back before those
Handlers get too tight on you
I light my own fires now
I light my own fires now
Slip in this town like it was
Measured to fit right on you
We light our own fires now
We lead ourselves into the night
Oh yeah,
I don't think I'll be held inside an ordinary cell
Am I the escape or
Am I the escape artist?
I know, I know it's just a question of details
Or one of,
Denial.
Could all of this trip wire
Cut so easy?
We'll just see
Cut the alarm before the
Motion sets off its sensors
We move in silence now
We guard our secrets with our lives
And cover our tracks so we are
Protected from surveillance
We move in silence now
We lead ourselves into the fight
Into the fight
Into the fight
Into the fight
And all the saints
Will rise again
As sons of wealthy men
Tear the whole world down before our eyes
And all the signs
We should have read
While we ignored the dead
Will haunt us long after the last of us has died
Slip out the back before those
Handlers get too tight on you
I light my own fires now
I light my own fires now
Slip in this town like it was
Measured to fit right on you
We light our own fires now
We lead ourselves into the night
Walking away.
It's not the same as running
Is it to you now
That you've run this in the ground?
and you say "Take this,
This medicine is just what you deserve
Swallow, choke, and die.
And this bitter pill is leaving you with such an angry mouth
One that's void of all discretion, such an awful tearing sound
With its measure only equaled by the power of my stare
Glaring over you and over you, this feeling of despair
Is never wearing out.
It's wearing off
And it's leaving you with such a heavy heart
And a head to match
The bottle is waiting
The cap is twisted, begging to be used
And so are you.
And this bitter pill is leaving you with such an angry mouth
One that's void of all discretion, such an awful tearing sound
With its measure only equaled by the power of my stare
Glaring over you and over you, this feeling of despair
Is never wearing out.
Wearing out, wearing out.
Morning calls for pain relief
A line above the step beneath
The worst that you could do
And the best that you could hope for
Is hardly the best
Tepid water chase the pills
With turpentine and chamomile
And don't get cheap with the wine
You need to be up all of the time
Shield your eyes, conceal your lies.
Don't blink, everyone's watching.
They'll think you're up to something.
They need for you to be everything
that they cannot
Morning calls for pain relief
A line above the step beneath
The worst that you could do
And the best that you could hope for
Is hardly the best
Tepid water chase the pills
With turpentine and chamomile
And don't get cheap with the wine
You need to be up--- all of the time
all of the time
Shield your eyes, conceal your lies.
Don't blink, everyone's watching.
They'll think you're up to something.
They need for you to be everything
that they cannot
Don't blink, everyone's watching.
They'll think you're up to something.
They need for you to be everything
that they cannot be themselves----
be themselves------
So this is odd,
the painful realization that all has gone wrong.
And nobody cares at all,
and nobody cares at all.
So you buried all your lover's clothes
and burned the letters lover wrote,
but it doesn't make it any better.
Does it make it any better?
And the plaster dented from your fist
in the hall where you had your first kiss
reminds you that the memories will fade.
So this is strange,
our sidestepping has come to be a brilliant dance
where nobody leads at all,
where nobody leads at all.
And the picture frames are facing down
and the ringing from this empty sound
is deafening and keeping you from sleep.
And breathing is a foreign task
and thinking's just too much to ask
and you're measuring your minutes by a clock that's blinking eights.
This is incredible.
Starving, insatiable,
yes, this is love for the first time.
Well you'd like to think that you were invincible.
Yeah, well weren't we all once before we felt loss for the first time?
Well this is the last time.
This is the last time.
This is the last time.
I lay down, I cant sleep
My mind drums on repeat
I stare at the ceiling from my side
I reach out you're right there
But you're lost in the details
I wait for the end of a long night
You can blame it on the changes
I can take it any way it is
Just got lost but we both found
We need this more than ever can
You take it can we save it
Sink our teeth in tear away at it
Can we hold out can you hold on
Cuz I need you more than you know now
We play like we don't know
We both lie but we don't show
That something is changing between us
We start out in one lane the same road
The same name but something we cant see divides us
You can blame it on the changes
I can take it any way it is
We just got lost but we both found
We need this more than ever
Can you take it can we save it
Sink our teeth in tear away at it
Can we hold out can we hold on
Cuz I need you more than you know now
Cuz I need you more than you know now [x2]
Don't run away cuz I need you more than ever now [repeated]
You can blame it on the changes
I can take it any way it is
We just got lost but we both found
We need this more than ever
Can you take it can we save it
Sink our teeth in tear away at it
Can we hold out can we hold on
Cuz I need you more than ever,
Cuz I need you more than you know now
Sharp disaster in a fresh new coma
Was it worth it when it was over?
Proving yourself right, you'd make the biggest noise
Well, I'd lock my hands behind my head
I'd cover my heart and hit the deck
I'd brace myself for the impact if I were you

Buried deep as you can dig inside yourself
And covered with a perfect shell
Such a charming beautiful exterior.
Laced with brilliant smiles and shining eyes, perfect posture
But you're barely scraping by, but you're barely scraping by.
Well this is one time, well this is one time
That you can't fake it hard enough to please everyone
Or anyone at all, or anyone at all.
And the grave that you refuse to leave
The refuge that you've built to flee
The places that you've come to fear the most
Is the place that you have come to fear the most.
Buried deep as you can dig inside yourself
And hidden in the public eye
Such a stellar monument to loneliness.
Laced with brilliant smiles and shining eyes, perfect makeup
But you're barely scraping by, but you're barely scraping by.
Well this is one time, well this is one time
That you can't fake it hard enough to please everyone
Or anyone at all, or anyone at all.
And the grave that you refuse to leave
The refuge that you've built to flee
The places that you've come to fear the most
Is the place that you have come to fear the most.
And you can't fake it hard enough to please everyone
Or anyone at all, or anyone at all.

Is the place that you have come to fear the most.
I guess it's luck, but it's the same
Hard luck, you've been trying to tame
Maybe it's love, but it's like you said
"Love is like a role that we play."
But, I believe in you so much
I could die for the words that you say
But, I believe in you so much
I could die from the words that you say
But, you're chasin' the ghost of a good thing
Haunting yourself as the real thing
Is getting away from you again
While you're chasin' ghosts
I guess it's luck, but it's the same
Hard luck, you've been trying to tame
Maybe it's love, but it's like you said
"Love is like a role that we play."
But, I believe in you so much
I could die for the words that you say
But, I believe in you so much
I could die from the words that you say
But, you're chasin' the ghost of a good thing
Haunting yourself as the real thing
Is getting away from you again
While you're chasin' ghosts
Just bend the pieces 'till they fit
Like they were made for it
But, they weren't meant for this
No, they weren't meant for this
Just bend the pieces 'till they fit
Like they were made for it
But, they weren't meant for this
Chasin' the ghost of a good thing
Haunting yourself as the real thing
Is getting away, away, away, away from you again
Chasin' the ghost of a good thing
Haunting yourself as the real thing
Is getting away from you again
While you're chasin' ghosts
Consider the odds, consider the obvious
The martyr is meaningless, the campaign has died
In the planning stages and the fallen faces are the singular proof
That it was ever alive
This purchased rebellion has been outbidded
Denounced and rescinded and left to die
Championless, championless, championless
I begged you not to go
I begged you
I pleaded
Claimed you as my only hope
And watched the floor as you retreated
I begged you not to go
I begged you
I pleaded
Claimed you as my only hope
And watched the floor as you retreated
Hope has sprung a perfect dive
A perfect day
A perfect lie
A slowly crafted monologue conceding your defeat
This purchased rebellion has been outbidded
Denounced and rescinded and left to die
Championless, championless, championless
I begged you not to go
I begged you
I pleaded
Claimed you as my only hope
And watched the floor as you retreated
I begged you not to go
I begged you
I pleaded
Claimed you as my only hope
And watched the floor as you retreated
Does it comfort you to know you fought the good fight?
Basking in your victory, hollow and alone
While you boast your bitter bragging rights to anyone who'll listen
While you're left with nothing tangible to gain
Sleep with all the lights on,
You're not so happy, you're not secure.
And you're dying to look cute in your blue jeans,
but you're plastic just like everyone, just like everyone.
And that face you paint is pressed,
impressing most of us as permanent,
and I'd like to see you undone.
College night will draw the crowds.
Dorms unload and you're heading out,
Here is your moment to shine.
Making up a history,
It's nothing from the life you lead,
but man, will they buy all your lines?
Sleep with all the sheets off,
bearing your mattress, bearing your soul.
And you're dying to look smooth with your tattoos,
but you're searching just like everyone, could be anyone.
And those friends that you have are the best
impressing most of us as permanent,
and I'd like to see you undone.
Youth's the most unfaithful mistress,
Still we forge ahead to miss her,
Rushing our moment to shine.
Making up a history,
It's nothing from the life you lead,
but man will they buy all your lines?
We're not twenty-one,
but the sooner we are,
the sooner the fun will begin,
so get out your fake eyelashes,
and fake i.d's,
and real disasters ensue,
it's cool to take these chances.
It's cool to fake romances.
and grow up fast, and grow up fast,
and grow up fast, and grow up fast.
I'm starting to fashion an idea in my head
where i would impress you
where every single word i said
would come out insightful or brave
or smooth or charming
And you'd want to call me
and i would be there everytime you need me
i'd be there everytime
but for now i'll look so longingly
waiting for you to want me, for you to need me
for you to notice me

It's been a year now since you were here now And
I've been trying to heal inside Dedications have all
been placed And I see your resemblance in my
face And on our birthday I said an extra wish for
you (for you)
And I have learned so much since you've been gone
And I have done so little for so long So now I'll
settle up my grievances And focus on the savory
And wave all these discrepancies away And I'll
peter out these misconceptions Give out faith at
my discretion Live a life that you would think was
sane (sane)
Displaying changes That they have made And I
wonder if you ever really wanted it this way And in
your memory they even hung a plaque for you
(for you)
And I have learned so much since you've been gone
And I have done so little for so long. So now I'll

Oh sweet lungs don't fail me now
Your burning has turned into fear
It drills me in my every step
Im movin quick
But you're always on my heels
Just one more breath, I beg you please
Just one more step, my knees are weak
My heart is sturdy but it needs you to survive
My heart is sturdy but it needs you
Breathe
Don't you want to breathe
I know that you are strong enough to handle what I need
My capalaries scream
There's nothing left to feed on
My body needs a reason to cross the line
Will you carry me there one more time
Steady lungs dont fail me know
I feel you bursting, but you wont let me die
Fill me up with every step, I'm feeling sick
But I'm leaving it behind
Just one more breath I beg you please
Just one more step my knees are weak
My legs are sturdy but they need you to survive
My heart is sturdy but I need you
Breathe
Dont you want to breathe
I know that you are strong enough to handle what i need
My capalaries scream
Theres nothing left to feed on
My body needs a reason to cross the line
Will you carry me there once more
I have reason to believe
That I have victories to taste
I can feel them on my teeth
Upon my lips
And in my chest
I can roll them on my tongue
They almost supplement the feat
I feel the tension in my lungs
And every move is filled with my resolve to
Breathe
Dont you want to breathe
I know that you are strong enough to handle what i need
My capalaries scream
Theres nothing left to feed on
My body needs a reason to cross that line
Will you carry me there one more time
Breathe in for luck,
breathe in so deep,
this air is blessed,
you share with me.
This night is wild,
so calm and dull,
these hearts they race,
from self control.
Your legs are smooth,
as they graze mine,
we're doing fine,
we're doing nothing at all.
My hopes are so high,
that your kiss might kill me.
So won't you kill me,
so I die happy.
My heart is yours to fill or burst,
to break or bury,
or wear as jewelery,
which ever you prefer.
The words are hushed lets not get busted;
just lay entwined here, undiscovered.
Safe in here from all the stupid questions.
"hey did you get some?"
Man, that is so dumb.
Stay quiet, stay near, stay close they can't hear...
so we can get some.
My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me.
So won't you kill me, so I die happy.
My heart is yours to fill or burst,
to break or bury, or wear as jewelery,
which ever you prefer.
Hands down this is the best day I can ever remember,
I'll always remember the sound of the stereo,
the dim of the soft lights,
the scent of your hair that you twirled in your fingers
and the time on the clock when we realized it's so late
and this walk that we shared together.
The streets were wet
and the gate was locked so I jumped it,
and I let you in.
And you stood at your door with your hands on my waist
and you kissed me like you meant it.
And I knew that you meant it,
that you meant it,
that you meant it,
and I knew,
that you meant it,
that you meant it.
Down in a local bar out on the Boulevard
The sound of an old guitar
Is saving you from sinking
It's a long way down, it's a long way
Back like you never broke, you tell a dirty joke
He touches your leg and thinks he's getting close
For now you let him
Just this once, just for now, and just like that it's over
Don't turn away, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Don't be afraid, but keep it all inside, all inside
When you fall apart, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Life is always hard for the Belle of the Boulevard
In all your silver rings, in all your silken things
That song you softly sing
Is keeping you from breaking
It's a long way down, it's a long way
Back here you never lost, you shake the shivers off
You take a drink to get your courage up
Can you believe it?
Just this once, just for now, and just like that it's over
Don't turn away, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Don't be afraid, oh keep it all inside, all inside
When you fall apart, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Life is always hard for the Belle of the Boulevard
Please hold on, it's alright
Please hold on, it's alright
Please hold on
Down in a local bar out on the boulevard
The sound of an old guitar
Is saving you
Don't turn away, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Don't be afraid, but keep it all inside, all inside
When you fall apart, dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Life is always hard, let me dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Don't turn turn away
Let me dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Don't be afraid, but keep it all inside, all inside
When you fall apart, let me dry your eyes, dry your eyes
Life is always hard for the Belle of the Boulevard
She is dancing for you now
Watch her twirling in the crowd
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
She is fine
She's filled with grace
Such loveliness for such a place
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
And you're left alone to ask of the ground
"Will you hold?"
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
This world alone is not enough
The swollen song burns and tapers off
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
Where fearless ones go out and play
Barreling through to Heaven's gates
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
Her skin beneath her fingernails
Blood stains tell her sordid tales
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
'Cause night recedes in scorching lines
The city's burning all the time
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
But will you hold her?
Will you hold her?
Will you?
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
This ruined puzzle
is beige with the pieces
all face down.
So the placing goes slowly.
The pictures of anything
other than it's meant to be.
But the hours they creep
The patterns repeat
Don't be concerned
You know I'll be fine on my own.
I never said "Don't Go" (don't go)
But I've hidden a note
It's pressed between pages that
you've marked to find your way back.
It says...
"Does he ever get the girl? "
But what if the pages stay pressed
The chapters unfinished
The stories too dull to unfold?
Does he ever get the girl?
This basement's a coffin
I'm buried alive
I'll die in here just to be safe.
I'll die in here just to be safe.
'Cause you're gone
I get nothing
and you're off with barely a sigh
I never said goodbye.
But I've hidden a note
It's pressed between pages
That you've marked to find your way back
It says...
"Does he ever get the girl?"
But I've hidden a note
That's pressed between pages
That you'll read if you're so inclined
Does he ever get the girl?
But the hours they creep
The patterns repeat
Don't be concerned
I know I'll be fine on my own.
I never said "Don't Go" (don't go)
Does he ever get the girl?
Whatever did happen to your soul?
I heard you sold it
To some old boy who lived uptown
Who could afford it
So what's gonna happen to you now?
Therapy? The pharmacy?
Crazy, that's what you'd like to believe
But it ain't easy
When you're going crazy
Over the rainbow
I think your story's jive, she said
There ain't nothing wrong with me
If I use it to get me some sympathy
Some ecstasy, a memory, I wanna remember me
Crazy, that's what you'd like to believe
But it ain't easy
When you're going crazy
Over the rainbow
Crazy, crazy over you
Crazy without you
Crazy without you
Crazy over you
When I'm back from the road
And you're out on it
And I'm tired of this distance
And I believe it's over
It's overrated
And this phone tag game is endless
The novelty is wearing
I'm hoping time will pass
Without any assistance or convincing
Road rules apply
There's so much action
You're getting busy
So I'll call your cellular phone
To tell you TV night was
Lonely without you
And so am I
So am I
It seems our day keeps falling on a leap year
So many high points on this last leg
I can't wait to recount them
It seems like nothing's happened
Until I've shared them with you
And the note that you have called
Says that you're half a day away
And you are heading home
Just in time for me
For me
To leave
And road rules apply
There's so much action
I'm getting busy
So make sure that I'm up to date on TV night
I hate to miss out
I think I miss you most
On Wednesdays and Saturdays
Seems our day keeps falling on a leap year
I sit and wonder of your pause
What makes you so sure
Our sins are not the start
Of something holy, divine.
I don't like the sound of this
No news is bad news
And all is quiet
And all your looks
Give no betrayal to what you shield or hide
Wider walls have not protected
Anything or anyone
The way I will protect your burning heart
I know your careful
'Cause I've been burned before
And I know how it makes you careful
And I know your symptoms
Are complicated from holding against the impulse
But if you're alone
Are you lonely?
Well you just don't have to be lonely
Anymore
I don't like the looks that
About you
There's no truth
But all my doubt and all my trust
Is no betrayal to what I feel inside
Wider walls have not protected
Anything or anyone
The way I will defend your beating heart
And I know your careful
Cause I've been burned before
And I know how that makes you careful
And I know yours symptoms
Are complicated from holding against the impulse
But if you're alone
Are you lonely?
Well you just don't have to be lonely
Anymore
I sit and wonder of your thoughts
What makes you so sure
Our sins are not the start
Of something holy, divine.
I don't like the sound of this
No news is bad news
I don't like the sound of this
No news is bad news
I don't like the sound of this
No news is bad news
I don't like the sound of this
No news is bad news

A line of strands to mark the trail,
No one said it would be easy.
I must admit I'd thought the risk was better waged in younger seasons, all these years in the cold play hell on the throat
Until everything I say burns like cinders,
Well it's hard to belong to a girl or a song
And the crease of a strangling winter
It's strange to be lost, stranger still to belong
On the strings of a twisting lie.
Along the way the turns are sharp,
No one said they would be easy,
I must admit I thought the trip was better made in younger seasons.
But all these years in the pursuit made a man of a fool,
Till every word I say is unwavered.
Well it's hard to belong to a girl or a psalm
In the case of a selfish believer,
It's strange to be lost, stranger still to belong
On the strings in a twisting line [x2]
And when the path I have made
From the grass to the grave,
I will love you still.
And when the sand turns to glass
And all that's left is the past
And I will love you still.
It's just like you to contest
Wearing like a label on your breast
Don't you see what this takes of me?
A certain callousness complies
With your charm and in your pride
A hopeful look draped in despise
I want to give you whatever you need.
What is it you need?
Is it what I need?
I want to give you whatever you need.
What is it you need?
Is it within me?
It's hard to explain how I am getting by on so little from you
It's hard to believe that I would let myself get so wrapped into you
There's got to be something that would be worthwhile for me to give to you
We need a connection but you seem to push me far away from you
From you, from you
The harder I push the farther I fall
Well you don't mind me being headstrong
But you don't want to sing along
Maybe it's trite but I can always, always, always be wrong
It's just like you to contest
Wearing like a label on your breast
Don't you see what this takes of me?
A certain callousness complies
With your charm and in your pride
A hopeful look draped in despise
I want to give you whatever you need.

From you, from you
The harder I push the farther I fall
Well you don't mind me being headstrong
But you don't want to sing along
Maybe it's trite but I can always, always, always be wrong
Be wrong
Be wrong
Trying not to be
Trying not to be
Trying not to be
Trying not to be wrong
From small pins to fiery burns,
These are the signals of my dying nerves
Singed by the heat of your lines and curves
Into a fire that could scorch the earth
I'm going through the motions
I'm going through the motions
I'm going through 'em
But I can't remember how to feel
If this is chemical,
Oh if this is chemical,
Oh if this is chemical
Oh if this is chemical
Then I am not afraid to be bound to the impulses of science
If this is chemical,
Oh if this is chemical,
Oh if this is chemical,
Oh if this is chemical,
Then I am not ashamed to be owned by the impulses
From small shocks to surgin' bolts
These are the signals of my spinal post
Sent down the wires through their lines and folds
Into a riot on my frontal lobe
I'm going through the motions
I'm going through the motions
I'm going through the motions
I'm going through 'em
But I can't remember how to feel
Since I ran my hands over you
Nothing else will ever do now
To cool me down
If this is chemical,
Oh if this is chemical,
Oh if this is chemical
Oh if this is chemical
Then I am not afraid to be bound to the impulses of science
If this is chemical,
Oh if this is chemical,
Oh if this is chemical,
Oh if this is chemical
Then I am not ashamed to be owned by the impulses
Since I ran my hands over you
Nothing else will ever do
Since I ran my hands over you
Nothing else will ever do
Since I ran my hands over you
Nothing else will ever do now
To cool me down.
If this is chemical,
Oh if this is chemical,
Oh if this is chemical
Oh if this is chemical
Then I am not afraid to be bound to the impulses of science
If this is chemical,
Oh if this is chemical,
Oh if this is chemical,
Oh if this is chemical
Then I am not ashamed to be owned by the impulses of science
If this is chemical
If this is chemical
If this is chemical
If this is chemical
I can't remember how to feel
If this is chemical,
If this is chemical,
If this is chemical,
If this is chemical,
Then I am not ashamed to be owned by the impulses of science
I believe in clean breaks, I keep the old troubles away
But you're making sure
I was lying when I said
"I can leave,
This behind"
I need you to ruin me
For this, finally,
'Cause it's burying me
Now, I'm in these old knots
Each move keeps me locked away
With each new embrace,
I have tied myself up.
More tightly,
Into you
Oh, but the more I fight
Then the deeper I'm trapped
And I can't break free of this hold that you have
And I crave you more
Under the heat of your touch
And I need your skin
To ruin me
For this wicked town
Where your ghosts are bound
To me
One last sacrifice
Of this ritual escape
I was lying when I said...
"I believe,
in clean breaks"

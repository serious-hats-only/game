A melody I start but can't complete Listen, to the sound from deep within
It's only beginning
To find release Oh, the time has come
For my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own
All cause you won't
Listen Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home, in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own You should have listened
There is someone here inside
Someone I'd thought had died
So long ago Oh, I'm screaming out, and my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or worked
Into your own
All cause you won't
Listen Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home, in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't
If you won't Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start
But I will complete Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling

Always stay gracious, best revenge is your paper Girl, I hear some thunder
Golly, look at that water, boy, oh lord [Beyonce]
So what are you going to say at my funeral now that you killed me?
Here lies the body of the love of my life whose heart I broke
Without a gun to my head
Here lies the mother of my children, both living and dead
Rest in peace my true love who I took for granted
The most bomb pussy who because of me sleep evaded
Her shroud is loneliness
Her god was listening
Her heaven will be a love without betrayal
Ashes to ashes
Dust to sidechicks I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na na
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na na Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na Drunk in love, I want you We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love we be all night Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding up in the club Drunk in love
We be all night, love, love We be all night, love, love
We be all night
And everything alright
No complaints from my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking
Park it in my lot 7-11
I'm rubbing on it, rub-rubbing, if you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right
Armand de brignac, gangster wife
Louie sheets, he sweat it out like wash rags he wear it out
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic to my boy toys
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic til my voice hoarse Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that big body
Been serving all this, swerve, surfing all in this good, good
(I'm nice right now)
Hold up
That D'USSÃ‰ is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up
Stumbled all in the house time to back up all of that mouth
That you had all in the car, talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be repping that third, I wanna see all the shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve
Foreplay in the foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slip the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take draws off, on site
Catch a charge I might, beat the box up like Mike
In '97 I bite, I'm Ike, Turner, turn up
Baby no I don't play, now eat the cake, Anna Mae
Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights you gonna need G3
4, 5, 6 flights, sleep tight
We sex again in the morning, your breastases is my breakfast
We going in, we be all night
Never tired, never tired
I been sipping, that's the only thing that's keeping me on fire, me on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinking watermelon
I want your body right here, daddy I want you, right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy I want you Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you

What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you Something don't feel right
Because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this?
Scrolling thru your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun There's something that I'm missing? Maybe my head for one
What's worst, lookin' jealous or crazy?
Jealous or crazy?

What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name
For yourself of master wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride? No
They used to hide from you, lie to you But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you Babe, it's such a shame You let this good love go to waste

Backseat lovin' in the car

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy?
Jealous and crazy?
Or like been walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you
I hop up off my bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "wassup?"
Wassup, wassup, wassup?
I hop up off my bed and get my swag on

Painting white flags blue Lord forgive me, I've been running
Running blind in truth

Tell the sweet I'm new I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away"
May the last one burn into flames Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Singin', freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
Cause I need freedom too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running

Call me bulletproof Lord forgive me, I've been runnin'
Runnin' blind in truth

Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
Cause a winner don't quit on themselves Ten Hail Marys, I meditate for practice
Channel 9 news tell me I'm movin' backwards
Eight blocks left, death is around the corner
Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona
Six headlights wavin' in my direction
Five-O askin' me what's in my possession
Yeah I keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts
Fire hydrants and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama don't cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me
Breathe for me, sing for me
Honestly guidin' me
I could be more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me
Like yeah, open correctional gates in higher desert
Yeah, open our mind as we cast away oppression
Yeah, open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Singin', freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
Cause I need freedom too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell

Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?
Hear me out I had my ups and downs, but I always find the inner strength to cool myself off. I was served lemons, but I made lemonade I thought that things like this get better with time
But I still need you, why is that?
You're the only image in my mind
So I still see you... around I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
Said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same Words don't ever seem to come out right
But I still mean them, why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel
But I still need to, why is that? I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
I said I miss you, missing you insane But if I got with you, could it feel the same It don't matter who you are
It's so simple, I feel it
But it's everything no matter who you love
It is so simple, I feel it
But it's everything I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
I said I miss you, missing you insane

He always got them fucking excuses
I pray to the Lord you reveal what his truth is
I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it, I'll be far away...
I'm far away...
But I ain't fucking with nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up (grow up)
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up (stroll up)
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there (not there)
He better call Becky with the good hair... He better call Becky with the good hair Mama said, you're a pretty girl
What's in your head it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down Pretty hurts
Shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is the disease of a nation
Pretty hurts
Shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery Blonder hair, flat chest
TV says bigger is better
South beach, sugar free
Vogue says
Thinner is better Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down Pretty hurts
Shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is the disease of a nation
Pretty hurts
Shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery Ain't no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
The pain's inside
And nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul, it's the soul that needs surgery
It's my soul that needs surgery
Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
Then you break when the fake facade leaves you in the dark
You left a shattered mirror
And the shards of a beautiful girl Pretty hurts
Shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is the disease of a nation
Pretty hurts
Shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery When you'r alone all by yourself
And you're lying in your bed
Reflection stares right into you
Are you happy with yourself
It's just a way to masquerade
The illusion has been shed
Are you happy with yourself
Are you happy with yourself
Yes We built sand castles that washed away
I made you cry when I walked away
And although I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, oh, babe
Every promise don't work out that way Dishes smashed on my counter from our last encounter
Pictures snatched out the frame

Drippin' candy on the ground We teach girls to shrink themselves
To make themselves smaller
We say to girls, you can have ambition
But not too much
You should aim to be successful but not too successful
Otherwise you will threaten the man
Because I am female
I am expected to aspire to marriage
I'm expected to make my life choices
Always keeping in mind
That marriage is the most important
Marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
And we don't teach boys the same
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or accomplishments
Which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings
In the way that boys are

Amen What goes around comes back around (hey my baby)
What goes around comes back around (hey my baby)
I say what goes around comes back around (hey my baby)
What goes around comes back around There was a time
I thought, that you did everything right
No lies, no wrong
Boy I must've been out of my mind
So when I think of the time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and I, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
I thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you
So baby good lookin' out I wanted you bad
I'm so through with that'
Cause honestly you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
You turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
And I'm gonna' always be the (best thing you never had)
Oh yeah, I bet it sucks to be you right now So sad, you're hurt
Boo hoo, oh, did you expect me to care
You don't deserve my tears
I guess that's why they ain't there
When I think that there was a time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and baby yes I saw the real you
Thank God you blew itI thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you
Baby good lookin' out I wanted you bad
I'm so through with that
Cause honestly you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
I said, you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
And I'll never be the (best thing you never had)
Oh baby I bet sucks to be you right now I know you want me back
It's time to face the facts
That I'm the one that's got away
Lord knows that it would take another place, another time, another world, another
life Thank God I found the good in goodbye I used to want you so bad
I'm so through with that
Cause honestly you turned out to be the (best thing I never had)
Oh you turned out to be (the best thing I never had) And I will always be the (best thing you never had)
Oh, best thing you never had
I used to want you so bad
I'm so through with that
Cause honestly you I don't wanna lose you,
But I don't wanna use you
Just to have somebody by my side
And I don't wanna hate you
I don't wanna take you But I don't wanna be the one to cry
And that don't really matter
To anyone anymore
But like a fool I keep losing my place
And I keep seeing you walk through that door But there's a danger
In loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know
It's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people
Don't stay where they are
Baby sometimes love just ain't enough Now I could never change you
I don't wanna blame you
Baby you don't have to take the fall
(You don't have to take the fall)
Yes I may have hurt you
But I did not desert you
Maybe I just wanna have it all
It makes a sound like thunder
It makes me feel like rain
Like a fool who will never see the truth
I keep thinking something's gonna change But there's a danger
In loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know
It's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people
Don't stay where they are
Baby sometimes love just ain't enough And there's no way home
When it's late at night and you're all alone
Are there things that you wanted to say?
Do you feel me beside you in your bed?
There beside you, where I used to lay? Oooh, oh, oh
Sometimes love just ain't enough
Oooh
There's a danger
In loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know
It's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people
Don't stay where they are
Baby sometimes love just ain't enough
Sometimes
Baby sometimes love, just ain't enough
Oooh, oh, mmmmm, mmmm
6, 763 out to be the (best thing I never had)
Oh you turned out to be the (best thing you never had)
Oh, I'll never be the (best thing you never had)
Oh baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now
what goes around, comes back around (I bet it sucks to be you right now) I remember being young and so brave
I knew what I needed
I was spending all my nights and days laid back day dreaming
Look at me I'm a big girl now, said I'm gon' do something
Told the world I would paint this town
Now betcha I run news 'Cause I put it
(Down like that, put down like that)
And I'm making
(All these racks, all these racks)
And I'm moving
(Round like that, moving round like that)
When I do it
(I don't look back, don't look back) I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want They love the way I walk
'Cause I walk with a vengeance
And they listen to me when I talk 'cause I ain't pretending
It took a while, now I understand just where I'm goin'
I know the world and I know who I am
It's 'bout time I show it I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman
I can do whatever I want I can be bad if I want
I can say what I want
I can live fast if I want
I can go slow all night long

Out in the darkness with no guide
I know the cost of a losing hand
Never felt the grace of God, oh I I found heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria I've been alone when I'm surrounded by friends
How could the silence be so loud?
But I still go home knowing that I've got you
There's only us when the lights go down You are my heaven on earth
You are my hunger, my thirst
I always hear this voice inside
Singing Ave Maria Sometimes love can come and pass you by
While you're busy making plans
Suddenly hits you, and then you realise
It's out of your hands
Baby you've got to understand You are my heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria

And i came to party Mama, I understand your many sleepless nights
When you sit and you think about Father
Or how you tried to be the perfect twice You used to dress and fix your hair
Then you smiled through your tears
In the mirror you would stare
And say a prayer
Like "I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart" Until you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off Mama (so sexy), you live and learn, that's just the way life goes
(Uh, you a killer, you a killer, killer)
Always know that you've got a daughter
That's so, so proud you took the high road
(You a killer, so sexy) You used to dress and fix your hair
You always smiled through your tears
In the mirror you would stare
And say a prayer
Like "I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart" Until you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off After all your tears
After all that pain's all clear
Mama, after all them years
We can start all over again
Mama, and now it all makes sense
Letting go is never the end
Mama, we can love again
This is where freedom begins Mama, so put your love on top

With hopes that maybe
I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale
Can you hold my hands
And be my guide? Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this? You can be a sweet dream
Or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on) Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me
Your love is too good to be true
(Turn the lights on) My guilty pleasure
I ain't going nowhere
Baby, long as you're here
I'll be floating on air
Cause you're my You can be a sweet dream
Or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on) I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy, you my temporary high I wish that when I wake up you're there
So wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by side Clouds filled with stars cover the skies (cover the skies)
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kinda dream is this? You can be a sweet dream
Or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you

Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you I tried to change
Closed my mouth more
Tried to be soft, prettier
Less... awake
Fasted for 60 days
Wore white
Abstained from mirrors
Abstained from sex
Slowly did not speak another word And that time my hair I grew past my ankles
I slept on a mat on the floor
I swallowed a sword
I levitated
Into the basement
Confessed my sins
And was baptized in a river
Got on my knees and said, "Amen"
And said, "I mean"
I whipped my own back
And asked for dominion at your feet I threw myself into a volcano
I drank the blood and drank the wine
I sat alone in begged and bent at the waist for God
I crossed myself in thought
I saw the devil
I grew thickened skin on my feet
I bathed in bleach
And plugged my menses with the pages from the holy book
But still inside me coiled deep was the need to know
Are you cheating?
Are you cheating on me? We built sand castles
But that washed away
I made you cry
When I walked away And although I promised
That I couldn't stay baby
Every promise
Don't work out that way
Every promise
Don't work out that way Dishes smashed on my counter
From our last encounter
Pictures snatched out the frame
Bitch I scratched out your name
And your face
What is it about you
That I can't erase baby When every promise
Don't work out that way
When every promise
Don't work out that way And your heart is broken
Cause I walked away
Show me your scars
And I won't walk away
And I know I promised
That I couldn't stay baby Every promise
Don't work out that way
Every promise
Don't work out that way Sometimes these walls seem to cave in on me
When I look in your eyes, I feel alive
Some days we say words that don't mean a thing
But when you holding me tight, I feel alive Make it last forever
Come one baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me
You and I together
Come one baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me Each day I feel so blessed to be looking at you
Cause when you open your eyes, I feel alive
My heart beats so damn quick when you say my name
When I'm holding you tight, I'm so alive
Now let's live it up Make it last forever
Come one baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me
You and I together
Come one baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me Make it last forever
Come one baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me
You and I together
Come one baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me We gotta hold on, I gotta hold on
You've got to hold on, you've got a hold on to me We gotta hold on, I gotta hold on
You've got to hold on, you've got a hold on to me Make it last forever
Come one baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me
You and I together
Come one baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me, blue Hold on to me, hold on
Been-sy-ay
Been-sy-ay, blue

And when my voice is screaming out to my own ears
That feels different from when I hear yours
Now that's just the way it is
And when I'm standing in this mirror after all these years
What I'm viewing is a little different
From what your eyes show you
I guess I didn't see myself before you
Moving forward
(Superpower) A subtle power
(Superpower) A tough love
(Superpower) Like a shark
(Superpower) Like a bear, a tough love
And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
Cause nothing I know can break us down
They can't break us down
And just like you I can be scared
Just like you I hope I'm spared
But it's tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know it's there: tough love (superpower)
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky
And what falls, it's a superpower (superpower)
The laws of the world never stopped us once
Cause together we got plenty superpower
(Superpower) A subtle power
(Superpower) A tough love
(Superpower) Like a shark
(Superpower) Too much to bear
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down When you were born
The angels sighed in delight
They never thought they'd see such a beautiful sight
You took the breath
And the world was right again
Tears were shed
How we have been blessed And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You make everything right

Maybe you like it, but I don't

And maybe we lost the magic peace And we're both too blind to find Let's start over

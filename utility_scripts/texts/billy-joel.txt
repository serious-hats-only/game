Cause I'm in a, I'm in a New York state of mind Friday night I crashed your party
Saturday I said I'm sorry
Sunday came and trashed me out again
I was only having fun
Wasn't hurting anyone
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change I've been stranded in the combat zone
I walked through Bedford-Stuy alone
And I rode my motorcycle in the rain
And you told me not to drive
But I made it home alive
So you said that only proves that I'm insane You may be right
I may be crazy
Oh, but it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
Turn out the light
Don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right Well, remember how I found you there
Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
You were lonely for a man
I said take me as I am
'Cause you might enjoy some madness for a while Now think of all the years you tried to
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as they
If I'm crazy then it's true
That it's all because of you
And you wouldn't want me any other way You may be right
I may be crazy
Oh, but it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
I'ts too late to fight
I'ts too late to change me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right You may be right
I may be crazy
Hey, but It just may be a lunatic you're looking for
Turn out the light
Oh, don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
You may be right You may be wrong but you may be right
You may be wrong but you may be right
You may be wrong but you may be right
You may be wrong but you may be right
You may be wrong but you may be right
You may be wrong but you may be right
You may be wrong but you may be right
You may be wrong but you may be right Uptown girl
She's been living in her uptown world
I bet she's never had a backstreet guy
I bet her momma never told her why I'm gonna try for an uptown girl
She's been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am And when she knows what
She wants from her time
And when she wakes up
And makes up her mind She'll see I'm not so tough
Just because
I'm in love with an uptown girl
You know I've seen her in her uptown world
She's getting tired of her high class toys
And all her presents from her uptown boys
She's got a choice Uptown girl
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
But maybe someday when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
And then I'll win And when she's walking
She's looking so fine
And when she's talking
She'll say that she's mine She'll say I'm not so tough
Just because
I'm in love
With an uptown girl
She's been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am Uptown girl
She's my uptown girl
You know I'm in love
With an uptown girl
My uptown girl
You know I'm in love
With an uptown girl
My uptown girl
You know I'm in love
With an uptown girl
My uptown girl
You know I'm in love
With an uptown girl She can kill with a smile, she can wound with her eyes.
And she can ruin your faith with her casual lies.
And she only reveals what she wants you to see.
She hides like a child, but she's always a woman to me. She can lead you to love, she can take you or leave you.
She can ask for the truth but she'll never believe.
And she'll take what you'll give her as long as it's free.
Yeah, she steals like a thief, but she's always a woman to me. Oooh, she takes care of herself.
She can wait if she wants, she's ahead of her time.
Oooooh, and she never gives out, and she never gives in,
she just changes her mind. And she'll promise you more than the Garden of Eden.
And she'll carelesly cut you and laugh while you're bleeding.
But she'll bring out the best and the worst you can be.
Blame it all on yourself, cause she's always a woman to me. Hmmmmmm Mmmmmm Hmmmmm Mmmmmm Oooh, she takes care of herself.
She can wait if she wants, she's ahead of her time.
Oooooh, and she never gives out, and she never gives in,
she just changes her mind. She is frequently kind and she's suddenly cruel.
But she can do as she pleases, she's nobody's fool.
And she can't be convicted, she's earned her degree.
And the most she will do is throw shadows at you,
but she's always a woman to me. Hmmmmmm Mmmmmm Hmmmmm Mmmmmm In every heart there is a room
A sanctuary safe and strong
To heal the wounds from lovers past
Until a new one comes along I spoke to you in cautious tones
You answered me with no pretense
And still I feel I said too much
My silence is my self defense And every time I've held a rose
It seems I only felt the thorns
And so it goes, and so it goes
And so will you, soon, I suppose But if my silence made you leave
Then that would be my worst mistake
So I will share this room with you
And you can have this heart to break And this is why my eyes are closed
It's just as well for all I've seen
And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows So I would choose to be with you
That's if the choice were mine to make
But you can make decisions too
And you can have this heart to break
And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows Slow down,
you crazy child
You're so ambitious for a juvenile
But then if you're so smart Tell me why are you still so afraid?
Where's the fire? What's the hurry about?
You better cool it off before you burn it out
You got so much to do And only so many hours in a day
hey
But you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want or you can just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through
ooh
When will you realize Vienna waits for you?
Slow down, you're doing fine
You can't be everything you wanna be before your time
Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight Tonight
Too bad, but it's the life you lead
You're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need
Though you can see when you're wrong You know you can't always see when you're right, you're right
You've got your passion, you've got your pride
But don't you know that only fools are satisfied?
Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true, ooh When will you realize Vienna waits for you?
...
Slow down,
you crazy child
Take the phone off the and disappear for a while
It's all right,
you can afford to lose a day or two
ooh
When will you realize
Vienna waits for you?
And you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want or you can just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through
ooh
Why don't you realize Vienna waits for you?
When will you realize Vienna waits for you? Anthony works in the grocery store
Saving his pennies for some day
Mama Leone left a note on the door
She said, ["Sonny, move out to the country."]
Oh, but working too hard can give you a heart attack-ack-ack-ack-ack-ack
You ought to know by now [(you ought to know by now)] Who needs a house out in Hackensack?
Is that all you get for your money?
And it seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama, if that's moving up, then I'm movin' out
I'm movin' out, mmm, ooh, uh huh Sergeant O'Leary is walking the beat
At night he becomes a bartender
He works at Mr. Cacciatorre's down on Sullivan Street
Across from the medical center
Yeah and he's trading in his Chevy for a Cadillac-ac-ac-ac-ac-ac
You ought to know by now [(you ought to know by now)] And if he can't drive with a broken back
At least he can polish the fenders
And it seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama, if that's moving up, then I'm movin' out
I'm movin' out, oh, ooh, uh huh You should never argue with a crazy man-man-man-man-man
You ought to know by now [(you ought to know by now)] You can pay Uncle Sam with the overtime
Is that all you get for your money?
And if that's what you have in mind
Yeah, if that's what you're all about
Good luck moving up, 'cause I'm movin' out
I'm movin' out, mmm, ooh, uh huh I'm movin' out Whoa, oa, oh
For the longest time
Whoa, oa, oh
For the longest
If you said goodbye to me tonight
There would still be music left to write
What else could I do
I'm so inspired by you
That hasn't happened for the longest time Once I thought my innocence was gone
Now I know that happiness goes on
That's where you found me
When you put your arms around me
I haven't been there for the longest time Whoa, oa, oh
For the longest time
Whoa, oa, oh
For the longest
I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall
And the greatest miracle of all
Is how I need you
And how you needed me too
That hasn't happened for the longest time Maybe this won't last very long
But you feel so right
And I could be wrong
Maybe I've been hoping too hard
But I've gone this far
And it's more than I hoped for Who knows how much further we'll go on
Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone
I'll take my chances
I forgot how nice romance is
I haven't been there for the longest time I had second thoughts at the start
I said to myself
Hold on to your heart
Now I know the woman that you are
You're wonderful so far
And it's more than I hoped for I don't care what consequence it brings
I have been a fool for lesser things
I want you so bad
I think you ought to know that
I intend to hold you for the longest time
Whoa, oa, oh
For the longest time
Whoa, oa, oh
For the longest time
Whoa, oa, oh
For the longest time
Whoa, oa, oh
For the longest time
Whoa, oa, oh
For the longest time Got a call from an old friend
We used to be real close
Said he couldn't go on the American way
Closed the shop, sold the house
Bought a ticket to the West Coast
Now he gives them a stand-up routine in L.A. I don't need you to worry for me cause I'm alright
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
I don't care what you say anymore, this is my life
Go ahead with your own life and leave me alone I never said you had to offer me a second chance
I never said I was a victim of circumstance
I still belong, don't get me wrong
And you can speak your mind
But not on my time They will tell you you can't sleep alone
In a strange place
Then they'll tell you you can't sleep
With somebody else
Ah, but sooner or later you sleep
In your own space
Either way it's okay
You wake up with yourself I don't need you to worry for me cause I'm alright
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
I don't care what you say anymore, this is my life
Go ahead with your own life and leave me alone I never said you had to offer me a second chance
I never said I was a victim of circumstance
I still belong, don't get me wrong
And you can speak your mind
But not on my time
I don't care what you say anymore, this is my life
Go ahead with your own life and leave me alone Well you went uptown riding in your limousine
With your fine Park Avenue clothes
You had the Dom Perignon in your hand
And the spoon up your nose
And when you wake up in the morning
With your head on fire
And your eyes too bloody to see
Go on and cry in your coffee
But don't come bitchin' to me Because you had to be a big shot, didn't you
You had to open up your mouth
You had to be a big shot, didn't you
All your friends were so knocked out
You had to have the last word, last night
You know what everything's about
You had to have a white hot spotlight
You had to be a big shot last night They were all impressed with your Halston dress
And the people that you knew at Elaine's
And the story of your latest success
Kept 'em so entertained
But now you just don't remember
All the things you said
And you're not sure that you want to know
I'll give you one hint, honey
You sure did put on a show Yes, yes, you had to be a big shot, didn't you
You had to prove it to the crowd
You had to be a big shot, didn't you
All your friends were so knocked out
You had to have the last word, last night
You're so much fun to be around
You had to have the front page, bold type
You had to be a big shot last night Well, it's no big sin to stick your two cents in
If you know when to leave it alone
But you went over the line
You couldn't see it was time to go home
No, no, no, no, no, no, you had to be a big shot, didn't you
You had to open up your mouth
You had to be a big shot, didn't you
All your friends were so knocked out
You had to have the last word, last night
So much fun to be around
You had to have a white hot spot light
You had to be a big shot last night Big shot
Big shot
Big shot
Big shot
Big shot
Big shot Come out, Virginia, don't let me wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
Oh, but sooner or later, it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one Well, they showed you a statue, told you to pray
They built you a temple and locked you away
Oh, but they never told you the price that you'd pay
For things that you might have done Only the good die young
That's what I said
Only the good die young
Only the good die young You might've heard I run with a dangerous crowd
We ain't too pretty, we ain't too proud
We might be laughing a bit too loud
Oh, but that never hurt no one So come on, Virginia, show me the sign
Send up a signal, I'll throw you the line
The stained-glass curtain you're hiding behind
Never lets in the sun Darlin', only the good die young, whoa
I tell you only the good die young
Only the good die young You got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation
You got a brand new soul
Mmm, and a cross of gold
But, Virginia, they didn't give you quite enough information
You didn't count on me
When you were counting on your rosary, oh, oh, oh They say there's a heaven for those who will wait
Some say it's better but I say it ain't
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
The sinners are much more fun You know that only the good die young
Oh oh oh, baby
I tell ya, only the good die young
Only the good die young You say your mother told you all that I could give you was a reputation
Oh, she never cared for me
But did she ever say a prayer for me?
Oh, oh, oh Come out, come out, come out Virginia, don't let me wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
But sooner or later, it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one You know that only the good die young
Tell ya baby
You know that only the good die young
Only the good die young Only the good
Only the good die young
Wooh, wooh
Ooh hoo, ooh hoo
Ooh hoo, ooh hoo
Only the good die young
Only the good die young 1 2 1 2 3 4
Some love is just a lie of the heart
The cold remains of what began with a passionate start
And they may not want it to end
But it will it's just a question of when
I've lived long enough to have learned
The closer you get to the fire the more you get burned
But that won't happen to us Because it's always been a matter of trust
I know you're an emotional girl
It took a lot for you to not lose your faith in this world
I can't offer you proof
But you're going to face a moment of truth
It's hard when you're always afraid
You just recover when another belief is betrayed
So break my heart of you must It's a matter of trust
You can't go the distance
With too much resistance
I know you have doubts But for god's sake don't shut me out
This time you've got nothing to lose
You can take it, you can leave it
Whatever you choose
I won't hold back anything
And I'll walk a way a fool or a king
Some love is just a lie of the mind
It's make believe until it's only a matter of time
And some might have learned to adjust But then it never was a matter of trust
I'm sure you're aware love
We've both had our share of
Believing too long When the whole situation was wrong
Some love is just a lie of the soul
A constant battle for the ultimate state of control
After you've heard lie upon lie
There can hardly be a question of why
Some love is just a lie of the heart
The cold remains of what began with a passionate start
But that can't happen to us
Because it's always been a matter of trust Goodnight my angel, time to close your eyes
And save these questions for another day
I think I know what you've been asking me
I think you know what I've been trying to say
I promised I would never leave you
And you should always know
Wherever you may go, no matter where you are
I never will be far away Goodnight my angel, now it's time to sleep
And still so many things I want to say
Remember all the songs you sang for me
When we went sailing on an Emerald Bay And like a boat out on the ocean
I'm rocking you to sleep
The water's dark and deep inside this ancient heart
You'll always be a part of me Goodnight my angel, now it's time to dream
And dream how wonderful your life will be
Someday your child may cry, and if you sing this lullabye
Then in your heart, there will always be a part of me
Someday we'll all be gone, but lullabyes go on and on
They never die, that's how you and I will be Saturday night and you're still hangin' around 
Tired of living in your one horse town 
you'd like to find a little hole in the ground, 
for awhile.  So you go to the village in your tie dyed jeans 
And you stare at the junkies and the closet queens 
It's like some pornographic magazine 
And you smile  (chorus)  Captain Jack will get you high tonight 
And take you to your special island 
Captain Jack will get you by tonight 
Just a little push, and you'll be smilin'  Oh yeah,...  Your sister's gone out, she's on a date 
You just sit at home and masturbate 
Your phone is gonna ring soon, but you just can't wait 
For that call  So you stand on the corner in your New English clothes 
and you look so polished from your hair down to your toes 
Ah but still your fingers gonna pick your nose 
After all,.  (chorus)  So you decide to take a holiday 
You got your tape deck and your brand new Chevrolet 
Ah, there ain't no place to go anyway 
What for?  So you got everything, ah, but nothing's cool 
They just found your father in the swimming pool 
And you guess you won't be going back to school 
Anymore.  (chorus)  So you play your albums, and you smoke your pot 
and you meet your girlfriend in the parking lot 
Oh but still you're aching for the things you haven't got 
What went wrong?  And if you can't understand why your world is so dead, 
why you've got to keep in style and feed your head 
Well you're 21 and still your mother makes your bed, 
And that's too long  (chorus) In the middle of the night
(Middle of the night)
I go walking in my sleep
(I go walking in my sleep)
From the mountains of faith
(Mountains of faith)
To the river so deep
(River so deep)
I must be looking for something
(Looking for something)
Something sacred I lost
(Sacred I lost)
But the river is wide
(Oh is wide)
And it's too hard to cross
(Too hard to cross) Even though I know the river is wide
I walk down every evening and stand on the shore
I try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find what I've been looking for In the middle of the night
(Middle of the night)
I go walking in my sleep
(I go walking in my sleep)
Through the valley of fear
(Valley of fear)
To a river so deep
(River so deep)
I've been searching for something
(Searching for something)
Taken out of my soul
(Taken out of my soul)
Something I'd never lose
(Never lose)
Something somebody stole
(Something somebody stole) I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
Hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is I've been looking for In the middle of the night
(Middle of the night)
I go walking in my sleep
(I go walking in my sleep)
Through the jungle of doubt
(Jungle of doubt)
To the river so deep
(River so deep)
I know I'm searching for something
(Searching for something)
Something so undefined
(So undefined)
That it can only be seen
(Only be seen)
By the eyes of the blind
In the middle of the night Not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
Baptized by fire, I wade into the river
That is runnin' through the promised land In the middle of the night
(Middle of the night)
I go walking in my sleep
(I go walking in my sleep)
Through the desert of the truth
(Desert of truth)
To the river so deep
(River so deep)
We all end in the ocean
(End in the ocean)
We all start in the streams
(Start in the streams)
We're all carried along
(Carried along)
By the river of dreams
In the middle of the night She can kill with a smile, she can wound with her eyes
She can ruin your faith with her casual lies
And she only reveals what she wants you to see
She hides like a child
But she's always a woman to me
She can lead you to love She can take you or leave you
She can ask for the truth
But she'll never believe
And she'll take what you give her as long as it's free
Yeah, she steals like a thief
But she's always a woman to me Oh, she takes care of herself
She can wait if she wants
She's ahead of her time
Oh, and she never gives out
And she never gives in
She just changes her mind She will promise you more
Than the Garden of Eden
Then she'll carelessly cut you
And laugh while you're bleedin'
But she'll bring out the best
And the worst you can be
Blame it all on yourself Cause she's always a woman to me
Oh, she takes care of herself
She can wait if she wants
She's ahead of her time
Oh, and she never gives out And she never gives in
She just changes her mind
She is frequently kind
And she's suddenly cruel
She can do as she pleases
She's nobody's fool
But she can't be convicted
She's earned her degree
And the most she will do
Is throw shadows at you
But she's always a woman to me
(Humming) ~*Verse One.*~ One minute I'm in Central Park.
Then, I'm down on Delancey Street.
Said, from the Bow'ry to St Mark's.
There's a syncopated beat. Right. ~*Pre-Chorus.*~ I said, Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.
I'm streetwise.
I can improvise.
I said, Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.
I'm streetsmart.
I've got New York City heart. ~*Chorus.*~ Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
I may not have a dime.
But I got street savoir faire.
Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
It's just be-bopulation.
And I got street savoir faire. ~*Verse Two.*~ The rhythm of the city.
But once you get it down.
Said, then you can own this town.
You can wear the crown! ~*Chorus.*~ Why should I worry? Tell me.
Why should I care?
I Said, I may not have a dime. Oh!
But I got street savoir faire.
Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
It's just doo-bopulation.
And I got street savoir faire. ~*Bridge.*~ Ev'rything goes.
Ev'rything fits.
They love me at the Chelsea!
They adore me at the Ritz! ~*Chorus.*~ Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
And even when I cross that line.
I got street savoir faire. ~*Fading.*~ I said, Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.
I said, Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo. A bottle of white, a bottle of red
Perhaps a bottle of rosé instead
We'll get a table near the street
In our old familiar place
You and I - face to face A bottle of red, a bottle of white
It all depends on your appetite
I'll meet you any time you want
In our Italian restaurant Things are okay with me these days
Got a good job, got a good office
Got a new wife, got a new life
And the family's fine
We lost touch long ago
You lost weight? I did not know
You could ever look so good after so much time You remember those days hangin' out at the Village Green
Engineer boots, leather jackets and tight blue jeans
Drop a dime in the box play the song about New Orleans
Cold beer, hot lights
My sweet romantic teenage nights Brenda and Eddie were the popular steadies
And the King and the Queen of the prom
Riding around with the car top down and the radio on
Nobody looked any finer
Or was more of a hit at the Parkway Diner
We never knew we could want more than that outta life
Surely Brenda and Eddie would always know how to survive Brenda and Eddie were still goin' steady in the Summer of '75
When they decided the marriage'd be at the end of July
Everyone said they were crazy
Brenda you know you're much too lazy
Eddie could never afford to live that kinda life
Oh, but there we were wavin' Brenda and Eddie goodbye They got an apartment with deep pile carpet
And a couple of paintings from Sears
A big waterbed that they bought with the bread
They had saved for a couple of years
They started to fight when the money got tight
And they just didn't count on the tears They lived for a while in a very nice style
But it's always the same in the end
They got a divorce as a matter of course
And they parted the closest of friends
Then the King and the Queen went back to the Green
But you can never go back there again Brenda and Eddie had had it already by the Summer of '75
From the high to the low to the end of the show
For the rest of their lives
They couldn't go back to the Greasers
The best they could do was pick up their pieces
We always knew they would both find a way to get by
That's all I heard about Brenda and Eddie
Can't tell you more than I told you already
And here we are wavin' Brenda and Eddie goodbye A bottle of red, a bottle of white
Whatever kinda mood you're in tonight
I'll meet you anytime you want
In our Italian restaurant You have to learn to pace yourself
(Pressure)
You're just like everybody else
(Pressure) You've only had to run so far, so good
But you will come to a place
Where the only thing you feel
Are loaded guns in your face
And you'll have to deal with pressure You used to call me paranoid
(Pressure)
But even you cannot avoid
(Pressure) You turn the tap-dance into your crusade
Now here you are with your faith
And your Peter Pan advice
You have no scars on your face
And you cannot handle the pressure All grown up and no place to go
Psych one, psych two
What do you know?
All your life is Channel 13
Sesame Street
What does it mean? I'll tell you what it means
Pressure Don't ask for help, you're all alone
(Pressure)
You'll have to answer to your own
(Pressure) I'm sure you have some cosmic rationale
Now here you are, in the ninth
Two men out and three men on
Nowhere to look, but inside
Where we all respond to pressure Pressure All your life is Time Magazine
I read it too.
What does it mean? PRESSURE! I'm sure you have some cosmic rationale
But here you are with your faith
And your Peter Pan advice
You have no scars on your face
And you cannot handle pressure The pressure
Pressure
1, 2, 3, 4 Pressure! She's got a way about her
I don't know what it is
But I know that I can't live without her
She's got a way of pleasin'
I don't know what it is
But there doesn't have to be a reason anyway
She's got a smile that heals me
I don't know why it is
But I have to laugh when she reveals me
She's got a way of talkin'
I don't know why it is
But it lifts me up when we are walkin' anywhere She comes to me when I'm feelin' down
Inspires me without a sound
She touches me and I get turned around
She's got a way of showin'
How I make her feel
And I find the strength to keep on goin' She's got a light around her
And ev'rywhere she goes
A million dreams of love surround her ev'rywhere She comes to me when I'm feelin' down
Inspires me without a sound
She touches me and I get turned around She's got a smile that heals me
I don't know why it is
But I have to laugh when she reveals me
She's got a way about her
I don't know what it is,
But I know that I can't live without her anyway Anthony works in the grocery store
Savin' his pennies for someday
Mama Leone left a note on the door
She said
"Sonny, move out to the country."
Oh but workin' too hard can give you
A heart attack-ack-ack-ack
You oughta know by now
Who needs a house out in Hackensack?
Is that all you get for your money? And it seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama, if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out.
Mmm I'm movin' out Sergeant O'Leary is walkin' the beat
At night he becomes a bartender
He works at Mister Cacciatore's down
On Sullivan Street
Across from the medical center
Yeah he's tradin' in his Chevy for a Cadillac-ac-ac-ac
You oughta know by now
And if he can't drive
With a broken back
At least he can polish the fenders And it seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama, if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out.
Mmm I'm movin out You should never argue with a crazy mi-mi-mi-mind
You oughta know by now
You can pay Uncle Sam with the overtime
Is that all you get for your money?
And if that's what you have in mind
Yeah that's what you're all about
Good luck movin up, cause I'm movin' out!
Mmm I'm movin' out I'm movin' out Good Night my angle time to close your eyes,
and save these questions for another day.
I think i know what you've been asking me.
I think you know what i've been trying to say.
I promised I would never leave you,
and you should always know,
Where ever you may go I will never be very far away.
Good night my angel now it's time to sleep,
And still so many thing I want to say.
Remember all the songs you sang for me, When went sailing on an emerald bay.
and like a boat out on the ocean,
I'm rocking you to sleep,
the water's dark and deep inside this ancient heart
you'll always be a part of me.
Good night my angel now it's time to dream,
and dream how wonderful your like will be.
Some day your child may cry and if you sing this lullabye
Then in your heart there will always be a part a of me.
Some day we'll all be gone
But lullabyes go on and on they never die that how you and I will be., Well I'm shameless when it comes to loving you
I'd do anything you want me to
I'd do anything at all And I'm standing here for all the world to see
There ain't that much left of me
That has very far to fall You know I'm not a man who has ever been
Insecure about the world I've been living in
I don't break easy, I have my pride
But if you need to be satisfied I'm shameless, baby I don't have a prayer
Anytime I see you standing there
I go down upon my knees And I'm changing, I swore I'd never compromise
But you convinced me otherwise
I'll do anything you please You see in all my life I've never found
What I couldn't resist, what I couldn't turn down
I could walk away from anyone I ever knew
But I can't walk away from you I have never let anything have this much control over me
Cause I worked too hard to call my life my own
Yes I made myself a world and it worked so perfectly
But it's your world now, I can't refuse
I never had so much to lose
I'm shameless... shameless You know it should be easy for a man who's strong
To say he's sorry or admit when he's wrong
I've never lost anything I ever missed
But I've never been in love like this... It's out of my hands I'm shameless, I don't have the power now
But I don't want it anyhow
So I've got to let it go I'm shameless, shameless as a man can be
You can make a total fool of me
I just wanted you to know I am shameless
Shameless
Shameless... Some people stay far away from the door
If there's a chance of it opening up
They hear a voice in the hall outside
And hope that it just passes by Some people live with the fear of a touch
And the anger of having been a fool
They will not listen to anyone
So nobody tells them a lie I know you're only protecting yourself
I know you're thinking of somebody else
Someone who hurt you
But I'm not above
Making up for the love
You've been denying you could ever feel
I'm not above doing anything
To restore your faith if I can
Some people see through the eyes of the old
Before they ever get a look at the young
I'm only willing to hear you cry
Because I am an innocent man
I am an innocent man
Oh yes I am Some people say they will never believe
Another promise they hear in the dark
Because they only remember too well
They heard somebody tell them before Some people sleep all alone every night
Instead of taking a lover to bed
Some people find that it's easier to hate
Than to wait anymore I know you don't want to hear what I say
I know you're gonna keep turning away
But I've been there and if I can survive
I can keep you alive
I'm not above going through it again
I've not above being cool for a while
If you're cruel to me I'll understand Some people run from a possible fight
Some people figure they can never win
And although this is a fight I can lose
The accused is an innocent man
I am an innocent man
Oh yes I am
An innocent man You know you only hurt yourself out of spite
I guess you'd rather be a martyr tonight
That's your decision
But I'm not below
Anybody I know
If there's a chance of resurrecting a love
I'm not above going back to the start
To find out where the heartache began Some people hope for a miracle cure
Some people just accept the world as it is
But I'm not willing to lay down and die
Because I am an innocent man I am an innocent man
Oh yes I am
An innocent man Well we're living here in allentown
And they're closing all the factories down
Out in bethlehem they're killing time
Filling out forms
Standing in line
Well our fathers fought the second world war
Spent their weekends on the jersey shore
Met our mothers in the uso
Asked them to dance
Danced with them slow
And we're living here in allentown
But the restlessness was handed down
And it's getting very hard to stay
Well we're waiting here in allentown
For the pennsylvania we never found
For the promises our teachers gave
If we worked hard
If we behaved
So the graduations hang on the wall
But they never really helped us at all
No they never taught us what was real
Iron and coke
And chromium steel
And we're waiting here in allentown
But they've taken all the coal from the ground
And the union people crawled away
Every child had a pretty good shot
To get at least as far as their old man got
But something happened on the way to that place
They threw an american flag in our face
Well I'm living here in allentown
And it's hard to keep a good man down
But I won't be getting up today
And it's getting very hard to stay
And we're living here in allentown We walked on the beach beside that old hotel
They're tearing it down now
But it's just as well
I haven't shown you everything a man can do
So stay with me baby
I've got plans for you This is the time to remember
Cause it will not last forever
These are the days
To hold on to
Cause we won't
Although we'll want to
This is the time
But time is gonna change
You've given me the best of you
And now I need the rest of you Did you know that before you came into my life
It was some kind of miracle that I survived
Some day we will both look back
And have to laugh
We lived through a lifetime
And the aftermath This is the time to remember
Cause it will not last forever
These are the days
To hold on to
Cause we won't
Although we want to
This is the time
But time is gonna change
I know we've got to move somehow
But I don't want to lose you know Sometimes it's so easy
To let a day
Slip on by
Without even seeing each other at all
But this is the time you'll turn back and so will i
And those will be the days you can never recall And so we embrace again
Behind the dunes
This beach is cold
On winter afternoons
But holding you close is like holding the summer sun
I'm warm from the memory of days to come This is the time to remember
Cause it will not last forever
These are the days
To hold on to
But we won't
Although we'll want to
This is the time
But time is gonna change
You've given me the best of you
But now I need the rest of you Listen boy
Don't want to see you let a good thing
Slip away You know I don't like watching
Anybody make the same mistakes
I made She's a real nice girl
And she's always there for you
But a nice girl wouldn't tell you what you should do Listen boy
I'm sure that you think you got it all
Under control You don't want somebody telling you
The way to stay in someone's soul You're a big boy now
You'll never let her go
But that's just the kind of thing
She ought to know Tell her about it
Tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept
That you're for real Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means Listen boy
It's not automatically a certain guarantee
To insure yourself
You've got to provide communication constantly When you love someone
You're always insecure
And there's only one good way
To reassure Tell her about it
Let her know how much you care
When she can't be with you
Tell her you wish you were there Tell her about it
Every day before you leave
Pay her some attention
Give her something to believe Cause now and then
She'll get to worrying
Just because you haven't spoken
For so long
Though you may not have done anything
Will that be a consolation when she's gone Listen boy
It's good information from a man
Who's made mistakes Just a word or two that she gets from you
Could be the difference that it makes She's a trusting soul
She's put her trust in you
But a girl like that won't tell you
What you should do Tell her about it
Tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason
To accept that you're for real Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means Tell her about it
Tell her how you feel right now
Tell her about it
The girl don't want to wait too long
You got to tell her about it
Tell her now and you won't go wrong
You got to tell her about it
Before it gets too late
You got to tell her about it
You know the girl don't want
To wait--you got to
Tell her about it There's a place in the world for the angry young man 
With his working class ties and his radical plans 
He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl 
and he's always at home with his back to the wall. 
He's proud of the scars and the battles he's lost 
He struggles and bleeds as he hangs on the cross 
And he likes to be known as the angry young man.  Give a moment or two to the angry young man 
With his foot in his mouth and his heart in his hand 
He's been stabbed in the back, he's been misunderstood 
It's a comfort to know his intentions are good 
He sits in a room with a lock on the door 
with his maps and his medals laid out of the floor 
And he likes to be known as the angry young man.  I believe I've passed the age of consciousness and righteous rage, 
I've found that just surviving was a noble fight 
I once believed in causes too, had my pointless point of view 
Life went on no matter who was wrong or right.  And there's always a place for the angry young man 
With his fist in the air and his head in the sand 
He's never been able to learn from mistakes 
He can't understand why his heart always breaks 
His honor is pure, and his courage as well 
he's fair and he's true, and he's boring as hell 
And he'll go to his grave as an angry old man.  There's a place in the world for the angry young man 
With his working class ties and his radical plans 
He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl 
and he's always at home with his back to the wall. 
He's proud of the scars and the battles he's lost 
He struggles and bleeds as he hangs on the cross 
And he likes to be known as the angry young man What's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing?
Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars?
Welcome back to the age of jive.
Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey?
You can't dress trashy till you spend a lot of money.
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me What's the matter with the car I'm driving?
Can't you tell that it's out of style?
Should I get a set of white wall tires?
Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile?
Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet's a true baby blue Continental.
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me. Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers
'Cause it's always been the same old scene.
There's a new band in town
But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine...
Aimed at your average teen How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
You could really be a Beau Brummell baby
If you just give it half a chance.
Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers.
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?
Don't you know that they're out of touch?
Should I try to be a straight 'A' student?
If you are then you think too much.
Don't you know about the new fashion honey?
All you need are looks and a whole lotta money.
It's the next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock & roll to me.
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me If it seems like I've been lost
In let's remember
If you think I'm feeling older
And missing my younger days
Oh, then you should have known
Me much better
Cause my past is something that never
Got in my way
Oh no Still I would not be here now
If I never had the hunger
And I'm not ashamed to say
The wild boys were my friends
Oh
Cause I never felt the desire
'til their music set me on fire
And then I was saved, yeah
That's why I'm keeping the faith
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Keeping the faith We wore matador boots
Only flagg brothers had them with the cuban heel
Iridescent socks with the same color shirt
And a tight pair of chinos
Oh
I put on my shark skin jacket
You know the kind with the velvet collar
And ditty-bop shades
Oh yeah
I took a fresh pack of luckys
And a mint called sen-sen
My old man's trojans
And his old spice after shave
Oh
Combed my hair in a pompadour
Like the rest of the romeos wore
A permanent wave
Yeah
We were keeping the faith
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Keeping the faith You can get just so much
From a good thing
You can linger too long
In your dreams
Say goodbye to the
Oldies but goodies
Cause the good ole days weren't
Always good
And tomorrow ain't as bad as it seems Learned stickball as a formal education
Lost a lot of fights
But it taught me how to lose o.k.
Oh
I heard about sex
But not enough
I found you could dance
And still look tough anyway
Oh yes I did
I found out a man ain't just being macho
Ate an awful lot of late night drive-in food
Drank a lot of take-home pay
I thought I was the duke of earl
When I made it with a red-haired girl
In the chevrolet
Oh yeah
We were keeping the faith
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Keeping the faith You know the good ole days weren't
Always good
And tomorrow ain't as bad as it seems Now I told you my reasons
For the whole revival
Now I'm going outside to have
An ice cold beer in the shade
Oh
I'm going to listen to my 45's
Ain't it wonderful to be alive
When the rock 'n' roll plays
Yeah
When the memory stays
Yeah
I'm keeping the faith
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Keeping the faith
I'm keeping the faith
Yes I am All the waiters in your grand café
Leave their tables when you blink, oh
Every dog must have his every day
Every drunk must have his drink Don't wait for answers
Just take your chances
Don't ask me why All your life you've had to stand in line
Still you're standing on your feet, oh
All your choices make you change your mind
Now your calendar's complete Don't wait for answers
Just take your chances
Don't ask me why Mmm, you can say the human heart is only make believe
I am only fighting fire with fire
You are still the victim of the accidents you leave
Sure as I'm a victim of desire All the servants in your new hotel
Throw their roses at your feet, oh
Fool them all but baby I can tell
You're no stranger to the street Don't ask for favors
Don't talk to strangers
Don't ask me why Yesterday you were an only child
Now your ghosts have gone away, oh
You can kill them in the classic style
Now you parlez-vous français Don't look for answers
You took your chances
Don't ask me why Don't ask me why Well I'm on the Downeaster Alexa
And I'm cruisin' through Block Island Sound
I have charted a course to the vineyard
But tonight I am Nantucket bound We took on diesel back in Mantauk yesterday
And left this morning from the bell in Gardiner's Bay
Like all the locals here I've had to sell my home
Too proud to leave I work my fingers to the bone So I could own my Downeaster Alexa
And I go where the ocean is deep
There are giants out there in the canyons
And a good captain can't fall asleep I got bills to pay and children who need clothes
I know there's fish out there but where, God only knows
They say these waters aren't what they used to be
But I've got people back on land who count on me So if you see my Downeaster Alexa
And if you work with the rod and the reel
Tell my wife I am trolling Atlantis
And I still have my hands on the wheel Now I drive my Downeaster Alexa
More and more miles from shore every year
Since they told me I can't sell no stripers
And there's no luck in swordfishing here I was a Bayman like my father was before
Can't make a living as a Bayman anymore
There ain't much future for a man who works the sea
But there ain't no island left for Islanders like me Ya-ya-ya-oh
Ya-ya-ya-oh
Ya-ya-ya-oh
Ya-ya-ya-oh She can kill with a smile
She can wound with her eyes
She can ruin your faith with her casual lies
And she only reveals what she wants you to see
She hides like a child
But she's always a woman to me She can lead you to live
She can take you or leave you
She can ask for the truth
But she'll never believe you
And she'll take what you give her as long as it's free
She steals like a thief
But she's always a woman to me Oh, she takes care of herself
She can wait if she wants
She's ahead of her time
Oh, and she never gives out
And she never gives in
She just changes her mind She will promise you more
Than the Garden of Eden
Then she'll carelessly cut you
And laugh while you're bleedin'
But she'll bring out the best
And the worst you can be
Blame it all on yourself
Cause she's always a woman to me She is frequently kind
And she's suddenly cruel
She can do as she pleases
She's nobody's fool
But she can't be convicted
She's earned her degree
And the most she will do
Is throw shadows at you
But she's always a woman to me Whoa, oa, oh
For the longest time
Whoa, oa, oh
For the longest
If you said goodbye to me tonight
There would still be music left to write
What else could I do
I'm so inspired by you
That hasn't happened for the longest time Once I thought my innocence was gone
Now I know that happiness goes on
That's where you found me
When you put your arms around me
I haven't been there for the longest time Whoa, oa, oh
For the longest time
Whoa, oa, oh
For the longest
I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall
And the greatest miracle of all
Is how I need you
And how you needed me too
That hasn't happened for the longest time Maybe this won't last very long
But you feel so right
And I could be wrong
Maybe I've been hoping too hard
But I've gone this far
And it's more than I hoped for Who knows how much further we'll go on
Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone
I'll take my chances
I forgot how nice romance is
I haven't been there for the longest time I had second thoughts at the start
I said to myself
Hold on to your heart
Now I know the woman that you are
You're wonderful so far
And it's more than I hoped for I don't care what consequence it brings
I have been a fool for lesser things
I want you so bad
I think you ought to know that
I intend to hold you for the longest time
Whoa, oa, oh
For the longest time
Whoa, oa, oh
For the longest time
Whoa, oa, oh
For the longest time
Whoa, oa, oh
For the longest time
Whoa, oa, oh
For the longest time Well we all have a face
That we hide away forever
And we take them out and
Show ourselves
When everyone has gone
Some are satin some are steel
Some are silk and some are leather
They're the faces of the stranger
But we love to try them on Well we all fall in love
But we disregard the danger
Though we share so many secrets
There are some we never tell
Why were you so surprised
That you never saw the stranger
Did you ever let your lover see
The stranger in yourself? Don't be afraid to try again
Everyone goes south
Every now and then
You've done it, why can't
Someone else?
You should know by now
You've been there yourself Once I used to believe
I was such a great romancer
Then I came home to a woman
That I could not recognize
When I pressed her for a reason
She refused to even answer
It was then I felt the stranger
Kick me right between the eyes Well we all fall in love
But we disregard the danger
Though we share so many secrets
There are some we never tell
Why were you so surprised
That you never saw the stranger
Did you ever let your lover see
The stranger in yourself? Don't be afraid to try again
Everyone goes south
Every now and then
You've done it why can't
Someone else?
You should know by now
You've been there yourself You may never understand
How the stranger is inspired
But he isn't always evil
And he isn't always wrong
Though you drown in good intentions
You will never quench the fire
You'll give in to your desire
When the stranger comes along. One... two... And-a-one, and-a-two, and-a-buckle-my-shoe There you are but nowhere left to hide
All the toys are tried to put aside
I think you'd meet them, but that's the price of freedom
But that's the cost of living in the prime of your life We done say... Da da da da dum dum dum...
Dum da dum... Ah dum da dum du dum...
Ah dum da da dum... There's no more conversation...
Luh ba dum bum, living in the prime of your life Oh oh ba da da dum ba da da dum ba wah
Dadadada ba dum da da da dum da wah Dadada... Da da da da dum dum dum...
Dum da dum... Ah dum da is crying la la lum...
Your own reflection will answer all your questions
If you don't believe you're in the prime of your life... Four... Five... Bridge... Oh oh ba dada dum ba dada dum ba wah...
Dadadada ba dum da da da dum da wah Da da da da dum dum dum, dum, da dum... Ah dum da dum du dum...
Ah dum da da dum... It's only make believe
And that's the take you're living in the prime of your life
Four... Five... Four... Five... Four... We met as soul mates
On parris island
We left as inmates
From an asylum
And we were sharp
As sharp as knives
And we were so gung ho
To lay down our lives
We came in spastic
Like tameless horses
We left in plastic
As numbered corpses
And we learned fast
To travel light
Our arms were heavy
But our bellies were tight
We had no home front
We had no soft soap
They sent us playboy
They gave us bob hope
We dug in deep
And shot on sight
And prayed to jesus christ
With all our might
We had no cameras
To shoot the landscape
We passed the hash pipe
And played our doors tapes
And it was dark
So dark at night
And we held on to each other
Like brother to brother
We promised our mothers we'd write
And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes we would all go down together
Remember charlie
Remember baker
They left their childhood
On every acre
And who was wrong?
And who was right?
It didn't matter in the thick of the fight
We held the day
In the palm
Of our hand
They ruled the night
And the night
Seemed to last as long as six weeks
On parris island
We held the coastline
They held the highlands
And they were sharp
As sharp as knives
They heard the hum of our motors
They counted the rotors
And waited for us to arrive
And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes we would all go down together She stood on the tracks
Waving her arms
Leading me to that third rail shock
Quick as a wink
She changed her mind She gave me a night
That's all it was
What will it take until I stop
Kidding myself
Wasting my time There's nothing else I can do
'cause I'm doing it all for leyna
I don't want anyone new
'cause I'm living it all for leyna
There's nothing in it for you
'cause I'm giving it all to leyna We laid on the beach
Watching the tide
She didn't tell me there were rocks
Under the waves
Right off the shore
Washed up on the sand
Barely alive
Wishing the undertow would stop
How can a man take anymore There's nothing else I can do
'cause I'm doing it all for leyna
I don't want anyone new
'cause I'm living it all for leyna
There's nothing in it for you
'cause I'm giving it all to leyna I'm failing in school
Losing my friends
Making my family lose their minds
I don't want to eat
I don't want to sleep
I only want leyna one more time Now I'm in my room
Watching the tube
Telling myself she still may drop
Over to say
She's changed her mind So, I wait in the dark
Listening for her,
Instead of my old man saying stop...
Kidding yourself,
Wasting your time There's nothing else I can do
'cause I'm doing it all for leyna
I don't want anyone new
'cause I'm living it all for leyna
There's nothing in it for you
'cause I'm giving it all to leyna All for leyna
All for leyna Everything I do
I'm thinking thoughts of only you, girl
Everywhere I go
Dreams of you will always follow Every step I take, every move I make
I'm trying to spend my life without you
I turn, I run, I hide, but I know deep inside
A part of me has died, yeah, yeah I closed my eyes and see
A picture of your face before me
Upon my lips I feel
A tender kiss, you're almost real Every step I take, every move I make
I'm trying to spend my life without you
I turn, I run, I hide, but I know deep inside
A part of me has died, yeah, yeah When you look into my eyes
And you see the crazy gypsy in my soul
It always comes as a surprise
When I feel my withered roots begin to grow Well I never had a place that I could call my very own
That's all right, my love, 'cause you're my home When you touch my weary head
And you tell me everything will be all right
You say, ["Use my body for your bedAnd my love will keep you warm throughout the night"] Well, I'll never be a stranger and I'll never be alone
Whenever we're together, that's my home Home can be the Pennsylvania Turnpike
Indiana's early morning dew
High up in the hills of California
Home is just another word for you Well I never had a place that I could call my very own
That's all right, my love, 'cause you're my home If I travel all my life
And I never get to stop and settle down
Long as I have you by my side
There's a roof above and good walls all around You're my castle, you're my cabin and my instant pleasure dome
I need you in my house 'cause you're my home
You're my home They say that these are not the best of times,
But they're the only times I've ever known,
And I believe there is a time for meditation in cathedrals of our own.
Now I have seen that sad surrender in my lover's eyes,
And I can only stand apart and sympathize. For we are always what our situations hand us...
It's either sadness or euphoria.
And so we argue and we compromise,
And realize that nothing's ever changed,
For all our mutual experience, our separate conclusions are the same. Now we are forced to recognize our inhumanity,
Our reason co-exists with our insanity.
And though we choose between reality and madness...
It's either sadness or euphoria. How thoughtlessly we dissipate our energies
Perhaps we don't fulfill each other's fantasies.
And so we'll stand upon the ledges of our lives,
With our respective similarities...
It's either sadness or euphoria Ali dances and the audience applauds
Though he's bathed in sweat he hasn't lost his style
Ali don't you go downtown
You gave away another round for free, woah Me, I'm just another face at Zanzibar
But the waitress always serves a secret smile, woah
She's waiting out in Shantytown
She's gonna pull the curtains down for me, for me I've got the old man's car
I've got a jazz guitar
I've got a tab at Zanzibar
Tonight that's where I'll be, I'll be Rose, he knows he's such a credit to the game
But the Yankees grab the headlines every time
Melodrama's so much fun
In black and white for everyone to see, woah Me, I'm trying just to get to second base
And I'd steal it if she only gave the sign, woah
She's gonna give the go ahead
The inning isn't over yet for me, for me I've got the old man's car
I've got a jazz guitar
I've got a tab at Zanzibar
Tonight that's where I'll be, I'll be Tell the waitress I'll come back to Zanzibar
I'll be hiding inthe darkness with my beer, woah
She's waiting out in Shantytown
She's gonna pull the curtaains down for me, for me I've got the old man's car
I've got a jazz guitar
I've got a tab at Zanzibar
Tonight that's where I'll be, I'll be I am the entertainer
And I know just where I stand
Another serenader
And another long-haired band
Today I am your champion
I may have won your hearts
But I know the game, you'll forget my name
And I won't be here in another year
If I don't stay on the charts I am the entertainer
And I've had to pay my price
The things I did not know at first
I learned by doin' twice
Ah, but still they come to haunt me
Still they want their say
So I've learned to dance with a hand in my pants
I let 'em rub my neck and I write 'em a check
And they go their merry way I am the entertainer
Been all around the world
I've played all kinds of palaces
And laid all kinds of girls
I can't remember faces
I don't remember names
Ah, but what the hell
You know it's just as well
'cause after a while and a thousand miles
It all becomes the same I am the entertainer
I bring to you my songs
I'd like to spend a day or two
I can't stay that long
No, I've got to meet expenses
I got to stay in line
Gotta get those fees to the agencies
And I'd love to stay but there's bills to pay
So I just don't have the time I am the entertainer
I come to do my show
You've heard my latest record
It's been on the radio
Ah, it took me years to write it
They were the best years of my life
It was a beautiful song
But it ran too long
If you're gonna have a hit
You gotta make it fit
So they cut it down to 3: 05 I am the entertainer
The idol of my age
I make all kinds of money
When I go on the stage
Ah, you've seen me in the papers
I've been in the magazines
But if I go cold I won't get sold
I'll get put in the back in the discount rack
Like another can of beans I am the entertainer
And I know just where I stand
Another serenader
And another long-haired band
Today I am your champion
I may have won your hearts
But I know the game, you'll forget my name
I won't be here in another year
If I don't stay on the charts Didn't I say
I wasn't ready for a romance
Didn't we promise
We would only be friends And so we danced
Though it was only a slow dance
I started breaking my promises
Right there and then Didn't I swear
There would be no complications
Didn't you want
Someone who's seen it all before Now that you're here
It's not the same situation
Suddenly I don't remember the rules anymore This night is mine
It's only you and i
Tomorrow
Is a long time away
This night can last forever I've been around
Someone like me should know better
Falling in love
Would be the worst thing I could do Didn't I say
I needed time to forget her
Aren't you running from someone
Who's not over you How many nights
Have I been lonely without you
I tell myself
How much I really don't care How many nights
Have I been thinking about you
Wanting to hold you
But knowing you would not be there This night
You're mine
It's only you and i
I'll tell you
To forget yesterday
This night we are together This night
Is mine
It's only you and i
Tomorrow
Is such a long time away
This night can last forever Tomorrow
Is such a long time away
This night can last forever Hey girl! I want you to know
I'm gonna miss you so much if you go
And hey girl! I tell you no lie
Something deep inside of me's going to die
If you must say so long
If this is good-bye Oh! hey girl! this can't be true
How am I supposed to exist without you
And hey girl! now don't put me on,
What's gonna happen to me when you're gone
How will I live,
How can I go on
How can I go on
Hey girl! Oh! hey girl! now sit yourself down,
I'm not ashamed to get down on the ground
And then beg you to stay
Don't go away
Hey girl!
Don't go away
Hey girl!
Don't go away If you search for tenderness
It isn't hard to find
You can have the love you need to live
But if you look for truthfulness
You might just as well be blind
It always seems to be so hard to give Honesty is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you I can always find someone
To say they sympathize
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve
But I don't want some pretty face
To tell me pretty lies
All I want is someone to believe Honesty is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you I can find a lover
I can find a friend
I can have security
Until the bitter end
Anyone can comfort me
With promises again
I know, I know When I'm deep inside of me
Don't be too concerned
I won't ask for nothin' while I'm gone
But when I want sincerity
Tell me where else can I turn
Because you're the only one that I depend on Honesty is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you I went searching for the truth
But in my innocence I found
All the con men and their acrobats
Who stomped me in the ground
If I count up their percentages
I know they're getting rich
But they haven't taken everything
Those paybacks are a bitch Though I've lost quite a lot
I am still in control
They can keep what they've got
But they can't have my soul
And if I don't have this all worked out
Still I'm getting closer, getting closer
I still have far to go no doubt
But I'm getting closer, getting closer What was ripped off by professionals
Is not all that it seems
While I must live up to contracts
I did not give up my dreams
If I see it as experience
It hasn't gone to waste
Lately all the missing pieces
Have been falling into place And if I could go back and start over somehow
I would not change that much
Knowing what I know now
Thought there have been sins
I will regret
Still I'm getting close, getting closer
I don't have all the answers yet
But I'm getting closer, getting closer I'm a mark for every shyster
From topanga to berlin
And I should have learned to kick them out
As soon as they crawled in
So to every bank in switzerland
That stores my stolen youth
I'm all right because despite the laws
You cannot hide the truth And although you will say
I am still too naive
But I have not lost faith
In the things I believe And if I don't have a this all worked out
Still I'm getting closer, getting closer
I still have far to go no doubt
But I'm still getting closer, getting closer Laura
Calls me
In the middle of the night
Passes on her
Painful information
Then these careless fingers
They get caught in her vice
Til they're bleeding
On my coffee table
Living alone isn't all that
It's cracked up to be
I'm on her side
Why does she push the poison on me?
Laura
Has a very hard time
All her life has
Been one long disaster
Then she tells me
She suddenly believes she's seen
A very good sign
She'll be taking
Some aggressive action
I fight her wars
While she's slamming her doors
In my face
Failure to break
Was the only mistake
That she made
Here I am
Feeling like a f***ing fool
Do I react the way exactly
She intends me to?
Everytime I think I'm off the hook
She makes me lose my cool
I'm her machine
And she can punch all the keys
She can push any button I was programmed through
Laura
Calls me
When she needs a good fix
All her questions
Will get sympathetic answers
I should
Be so
Immunized
To all of her tricks
She's surviving
On her second chances
Sometimes I feel like this
Godfather deal is all wrong
How can she hold an umbilical chord
For so long?
I've done everything I can
What else am I supposed to do
I'm her machine
And she can punch all the keys
She can push any button I was programmed through
Laura
Loves me
Even if I don't care
That's my problem
That's her sacred absolution
If she had to
She would put herself in my chair
Even though i
Faced electrocution
She always says
I'm the best friend that
She's ever had
How do you
Hang up on someone
Who needs you that bad? She cuts you once
She cuts you twice
Still you believe
The wound is so fresh you can taste the blood
But you don't have strength to leave
You've been bought
You've been sold
You've been locked outside the door
But you stand there pleadin' with your insides bleedin'
'Cause you deep down want some more
When she says she wants forgiveness
Such a clever masquerade
She's so good with her stiletto...
You don't even see the blade...
You don't see the blade...
Oh... she cuts you hard
She cuts you deep
She's got so much skill
She's so fascinatin' that you're still there waitin'
When she comes back for the kill
You've been slashed in the face
You've been left there to bleed
You wanna runaway but you know you're gonna stay
'Cause she gives you what you need
Then she says she needs affection...
While she searches for the vein...
She's so good with her stiletto...
You don't really mind the pain
You don't mind the pain...
Oh... oh whoa, uh
She cuts you out
She cuts you down
She carves up your life
But you won't do nothn' as she keeps on cuttin'
'Cause you know you love the knife
You've been bought
You've been sold
You've been locked outside the door
But you stand there pleadin' with your insides bleedin'
'Cause you deep down want some more
Then she says she wants affection...
While she searches for the vein...
She's so good with her stiletto...
You don't really mind the pain...
You don't mind the pain... Lyrics of All of Me - Jm De Guzman What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind 'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, ohoh How many times do I have to tell you
Even when you're crying you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind 'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, ohoh Give me all of you
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard 'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, ohoh Bobby's driving through the city tonight
Through the lights in a hot new rent-a-car
He joins the lovers in his heavy machine
It's a scene down on Sunset Boulevard Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby Johnny's taking care of things for a while
And his style is so right for troubadours
They got him sitting with his back to the door
Now he won't be my fast gun anymore Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby Moving on is a chance that you take
Any time you try to stay together
Whoa
Say a word out of line
And you find that the friends you had
Are gone forever
Forever So many faces in and out of my life
Some will last
Some will just be now and then
Life is a series of hellos and goodbyes
I'm afraid it's time for goodbye again Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby Moving on is a chance that you take
Any time you try to stay together
Whoa
Say a word out of line
And you find that the friends you had
Are gone forever
Forever So many faces in and out of my life
Some will last
Some will just be now and then
Life is a series of hellos and goodbyes
I'm afraid it's time for goodbye again Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby Clear as a crystal, sharp as a knife
I feel like I'm in the prime of my life
Sometimes it feels like I'm going too fast
I don't know how long this feeling will last
Maybe it's only tonight Darling I don't know why I got to extremes
Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens
And if I stand or I fall
It's all or nothing at all
Darling I don't know why I got to extremes Sometimes I'm tired, sometimes I'm shot
Sometimes I don't know how much more I've got
Maybe I'm headed over the hill
Maybe I've set myself up for the kill
Tell me how much do you think you can take
Until the heart in you is starting to break?
Sometimes it feels like it will Darling I don't know why I go to extremes
Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens
You can be sure when I'm gone
I won't be out there too long
Darling I don't know why I got to extremes Out of the darkness, into the light
Leaving the scene of the crime
Either I'm wrong or I'm perfectly right every time
Sometimes I lie awake, night after night
Coming apart at the seams
Eager to please, ready to fight
Why do I go to extremes? And if I stand or I fall
It's all or nothing at all Darling I don't know why I go to extremes
Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens
And if I stand of I fall
It's all or nothing at all
Darling I don't know why I go to extremes No I don't know why I go to extremes
Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens
You can be sure when I'm gone
I won't be out there too long
Darling I don't know why I go to extremes Even though I'm in love
Sometimes I get so afraid
I'll say something so wrong
Just to have something to say I know the moment isn't right
To tell the girl a comical line
To keep the conversation light
I guess I'm just frightened out of my mind But if that's how I feel
Then it's the best feeling I've even known
It's undeniably real
Leave a tender moment alone Yes I know I'm in love
But just when I ought to relax
I put my foot in my mouth
Cause I'm just avoiding the facts If the girl gets too close
If I need some room to escape
When the moment arose
I'd tell her it's all a mistake But that's not how I feel
No that's not the woman I've known
She's undeniably real
So leave a tender moment alone But it's not only me
Breaking down when the tension gets high
Just when I'm in a serious mood
She is suddenly quiet and shy Leave a tender moment
Leave it alone I know the moment isn't right
To hold my emotions inside
To change the attitude tonight
I've run out of places to hide And if that's how I feel
Then it's the best feeling I've even known
It's undeniably real
Leave a tender moment alone You got to leave a tender moment alone
Leave a tender moment
Leave it alone
You've got to leave a tender moment
Leave a tender moment alone She's got a way about her
I don't know what it is
But I know that I can't live without her
She's got a way of pleasin'
I don't know what it is
But there doesn't have to be a reason anyway She's got a smile that heals me
I don't know why it is
But I have to laugh when she reveals me
She's got a way of talkin'
I don't know why it is
But it lifts me up when we are walkin' anywhere She comes to me when I'm feelin' down
Inspires me without a sound
She touches me and I get turned around She's got a way of showin'
How I make her feel
And I find the strength to keep on goin'
She's got a way of walkin
And everywhere she goes
A million dreams of love surround her everywhere She comes to me when I'm feelin' down
Inspires me without a sound
She touches me
I get turned around She's got a smile that heals me
I don't know what it is
But I have to laugh when she reveals me
She's got a way about her
I don't know what it is
But I know that I can't live without her anyway I've seen the lights go out on broadway-
I saw the empire state laid low.
And life went on beyond the palisades,
They all bought bright cadillacs-
And left there long ago. We held a concert out in brooklyn-
To watch the island bridges blow.
They turned our power down,
And drove us underground-
But we went right on with the show... I've seen the lights go out on broadway-
I saw the ruins at my feet,
You know we almost didn't notice it-
We'd see it all the time on forty-second street. They burned the churches up in harlem-
Like in that spanish civil war-
The flames were everywhere,
But no one really cared-
It always burned up there before... I saw the lights go out on broadway-
I watched the mighty skyline fall.
The boats were waiting at the battery,
The union went on strike-
They never sailed at all. They sent a carrier out from norfolk-
And picked the yankees up for free.
They said that queens could stay,
They blew the bronx away-
And sank manhattan out to sea... You know those lights were bright on broadway-
But that was so many years ago...
Before we all lived here in florida-
Before the mafia took over mexico.
There are not many who remember-
They say a handful still survive...
To tell the world about...
The way the lights went out,
And keep the memory alive... Victor was born
The spring of 44
and never saw
His father anymore A child of sacrifice
A child of war
Another son who never had
A father after Leningrad
Went off to school and learned to serve his state
followed the rules
and drank his vodka straight
the only way to live
was drown the hate
the russian life was very sad
and such was life in leningrad
I was born in 49 A cold war kid in McCarthy times
Stop 'em at the 38th parallel
blast those yellow reds to hell
cold war kids were hard to kill
under their desks in an air raid drill haven't they heard we won the war
what do they keep on fighting for?
Victor was sent
to some red army town
served out his time
became a circus clown
the greatest happiness
he'd ever found was making russian children glad
when children lived in leningrad.
The children lived in Levittown
hid in the shelters underground
Til the soviets turned their ships around
tore the cuban missiles down
and in that bright October sun
we knew our childhood days were done
And I watched my friends go off to war
What do they keep on fighting for?
So my child and I came to this place
to meet him, eye to eye and face to face
He made my daughter laugh
Then we embraced
We never knew what friends we had
Until we came to Leningrad. I didn't want to do it but I got too lonely
I had to call you up in the middle of the night
I know it's awful hard to try to make love long distance
But I really needed stimulation
Though it was only my imagination It's just a fantasy
It's not the real thing
It's just a fantasy
It's not the real thing
But sometimes a fantasy
Is all you need When am I gonna take control get a hold of my emotions
Why does it only seem to hit me in the middle of the night
You told me there's a number I can always dial for assistance
I don't want to deal with outside action
Only you can give me satisfaction It's just a fantasy
It's not the real thing
It's just a fantasy
It's not the real thing
But sometimes a fantasy
Is all you need Sure it would be better if I had you here to hold me
Be better baby but believe me it's the next best thing
I'm sure there's many times you've wanted me to hear your secrets
Don't be afraid to say the words that move me
Anytime you want to tell them to me It's just a fantasy
It's not the real thing
It's just a fantasy
It's not the real thing
But sometimes a fantasy
Is all you need
It's just a fantasy
It's not the real thing
It's just a fantasy
It's not the real thing I play nights in the spanish part of town
I've got music in my hands
The work is hard to find
But that don't get me down
Rosalinda understands Crazy latin dancing
Solo down in herald square
Oh, Havana
I've been searching for you everywhere
And though I'll never be there
I know what I would see there
I can always find my cuban skies
In Rosalinda's eyes When she smiles
She gives everything to me
When she's all alone she cries
I'd do anything to take away her tears
Because they're Rosalinda's eyes Senorita don't be lonely
I will soon be there
Oh, Havana
I've been searching for you everywhere
I've got a chance to make it
It's time for me to take it
I'll return before the fire dies
In Rosalinda's eyes All alone in a puerto rican band
Union wages, wedding clothes
Hardly anyone has seen how good I am
But Rosalinda says she knows Crazy latin dancing
Solo down in herald square
Oh, Havana
I've been searching for you everywhere
And though I'll never be there
I know what I would see there
I can always find my cuban skies
In Rosalinda's eyes
Ok
Senorita don't be lonely
I will soon be there
Oh, Havana
I've been searching for you everywhere
I've got a chance to make it
It's time for me to take it
I'll return before the fire dies
In Rosalinda's eyes Miami 2017 (seen the lights go out on broadway) seen the lights go out broadway
i saw the empire state laid low

to tell the world about
the way the lights went out
and keep the memory alive Goodnight, my angel
Time to close your eyes
And save these questions for another day
I think I know what you've been asking me
I think you know what I've been trying to say
I promised I would never leave you
And you should always know
Wherever you may go
No matter where you are
I never will be far away Goodnight, my angel
Now it's time to sleep
And still so many things I want to say
Remember all the songs you sang for me
When we went sailing on an emerald bay
And like a boat out on the ocean
I'm rocking you to sleep
The water's dark and deep
Inside this ancient heart
You'll always be a part of me Lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu
lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu Goodnight, my angel
Now it's time to dream
And dream how wonderful your life will be
Someday your child may cry
And if you sing this lullabye
Then in your heart
There will always be a part of me Someday we'll all be gone
But lullabyes go on and on...
They never die
That's how you
And I
Will be Now we take our time, so nonchalant,
And spend our nights so bon vivant.
We dress our days in silken robes,
The money comes, the money goes,
We know it's all a passing phase. We light our lamps for atmosphere,
And hang our hopes on chandeliers.
We're going wrong, we're gaining weight,
We're sleeping long and far too late.
And so it's time to change our ways...
But I've loved these days. Now as we indulge in things refined,
We hide our hearts from harder times.
A string of pearls, a foreign car,
Oh, we can only go so far
On caviar and Cabernet. We drown our doubts in dry champagne,
And soothe our souls with fine cocaine.
I don't know why I even care,
We get so high and get nowhere.
We'll have to change our jaded ways...
But I've loved these days. So before we end, and then begin,
We'll drink a toast to how it's been-
A few more hours to be complete,
A few more nights on satin sheets,
A few more times that I can say...
I've loved these days. Baby all the lights are turned on you
Now you're in the center of the stage
Everything revolves on what you do
Ah, you are in your prime; you've come of age And you can always have your way somehow
But everybody loves you now You can walk away from your mistakes
You can turn your back on what you do
Just a little smile is all it takes
Yeah, you can have your cake and eat it too Loneliness will get to you somehow
But everybody loves you now Ah, they all want your white body
And they await your reply
Ah, but between you and me and the staten island ferry
So do i All the people want to know your name
Soon there will be lines outside your door
Feelings do not matter in your game
Yeah, 'cause nothing's gonna touch you anymore So your life is only living anyhow
And everybody loves you now Close your eyes when you don't want to see
Stay at home when you don't want to go
Only speak to those who will agree
Yeah, and close your mind when you don't want to know You have lost you innocence somehow
But everybody loves you now Ah, you know that nothing lasts forever
And it's all been done before
Ah, but you ain't got the time to go to cold spring harbor
No more See how all the people gather 'round
Hey, isn't it a thrill to see them crawl?
Keep your eyes ahead and don't look down
Yeah, and lock yourself inside your sacred wall This is what you wanted; ain't you proud?
'cause everybody loves you now I know you well enough to tell you've got your reasons
That's not the kind of code you're inclined to break
Some things unknown are best left alone foreverAnd if a vow is what it takes
Haven't you paid for your mistakesAfter the moment passes
And the impulse disappearsYou can still hold back
Because you don't crack very easilyIt's a time-honored resolution
Because the danger is always nearIt's with you now
But that ain't how it was supposed to be
And it's hard to believe after all these years
It still gives you pain and it still brings tearsAnd you feel like a fool
'Cause in spite of the rulesYou've got a memoryChorus A picture postcard
A folded stub
A program of the play
File away your photographs
Of your holiday And your mementos
Will turn to dust
But that's the price you pay
For every year's a souvenir
That slowly fades away
Every year's a souvenir
That slowly fades away Well I see you in the morning
Putting on your pretty clothes
And I watch you do your make-up
Like they do in all those fashion shows
Then you turn to me so that I can see
If you put yourself together right
Then you go away and you're gone all day
But I know you're coming home tonight
And when you're home, darling all you've got to be is you
But when in rome, do as the romans do Well it's alright if you're tired when your day is done
You can see when you look at me, you're not the only one
It's a cold, cruel world for a working girl
But you can't let them see you cry
It's a fact of life, now man and wife
Work full time to just get by
And when we're home all it's gonna be is me and you
But when in rome, do as the romans do I've done some strange things I never thought I'd do before
But if the strain brings happiness, more or less...
More or less... Then I don't mind masquerading with all those other fools
I don't mind the games I'm playing,
Because I've learned the rules
And when times are tough, I've got just enough
If you're standing right by my side
Darling more and more I get hungry for
All the ways you keep me satisfied
On our own there ain't nothing that we can't get thru
But when in rome, do as the romans do Then I don't mind masquerading with all those other fools
I don't mind the games I'm playing,
Because I've learned the rules
It doesn't matter when we're home, all alone
All we've got to be is me and you
On our own there ain't nothing that we can't get thru
But when in rome, do as the romans do Swing that hammer and break that stone
Push those buttons and answer that phone
Coffee in the morning and martinis at night
Everybody's working up a big appetite
Do as the romans do... Here I am again
In this smoky place
With my brandy eyes
I'm talking to myself
You were the one
You were the one Here I go again
Looking for your face
And I realize
That I should look for someone else
But you were the one
You were the one I'm looking for comfort
That I can take
From someone else
But after all
I know there is no one
That can save me from myself
You were the only one Me revoici
Dans ce bar enfume
Avec mes yeux iures
Je me parle a moi meme
C'etait toi
C'etait toi Me revoici
Cherchant ton visage
Et je realise
Que je devrais en chercher une autre
C'etait toi
You were the one Je recherche l'affection
Qu'une autre pourrait me donner
Mais apres tout
Je sais qu'il n'y a personne
Personne qui puisse me sauver
Tu etais la seule I'm looking for comfort
That I can take
From someone else
But after al
I know there is no one
That can save me, save me from myself
You were the only one From a town
Known as Wheeling
West Virginia
Note a boy with a .6 gun in his hand
And his daring life of crime
Made him a legend in his time
East and West of the Rio Grande
Well he started with a bank in Colorado
In the pocket of his vest a colt he hid
And his age and his size
Took the teller by surprise
Soon the word spread
of Billy the Kid
But he never traveled heavy
Yes he always rode alone
And he soon put many older guns to shame
And he never had a sweet heart
And he never had a home
But the cowboy and the rancher knew his name
While he robbed his way from Utah to Oklahoma
And the law just could not seem to track him down
And it served the legend well
For the folks they loved to tell
About when Billy the Kid came to town
While one cold day a posse captured Billy
And the judge said string him up
For what he did
And the cowboys and their kin
like the sea came pourin' in to watch
the hangin'
of Billy the Kid
And he never traveled heavy
Yes he always rode alone
And he soon put many older guns to shame
And he never had a sweetheart
But he finally found a home
Underneath the boothill grave that bears his name
From a town known as Oyster Bay
Long Island
Rode a boy with a six pack in his hands
And his daring life of crime
made him a legend in his time
East and West of the Rio Grande
Finish Well I know you got your troubles
But I've got problems of my own
It's all relative you see, what happiness should be
And we got to work it out alone.
I know about your situation
And I know all about your pain
But you know it's true though it's no comfort to you
Into each life must fall some rain We all have our cross to bear.
We all walk in darkness sometimes.
Though I know it don't seem fair,
We all have our cross to bear. You know I hate to see you cry
I hate to see you cry now
Because I had my share of tears
And though it may sound cool
you know I'd be a fool to let it slide a few more years.
Listen, I just got to have my freedom
And if that's giving you the blues
That's the price you pay, Lord, there ain't no other way
But to get down on your knees and pay your dues
'Cause don't you know... We all have our cross to bear
We all knuckle under sometimes
Oh, everybody gets his share
We all have our cross to bear Oh, I just got to have my freedom
And if that's giving you the blues
Well, that's the price you pay, Lord,
There ain't no other way
But to get down on your knees and pay your dues
'Cause don't you know... We all have our cross to bear
We all walk in darkness sometimes
Oh, everybody gets his share, mmm,
"cause we all have our cross to bear Oh baby, you don't get turned on by the radio.
Oh baby, you got nothing to play on your stereo.
Why don't the beatles get back together?
Why don't nobody sing of romance? -
Oh baby, all you wanna do is dance. Oh baby, I think you are lost in the seventies.
Oh baby, the music she ain't what she used to be.
You don't understand what they're saying,
You've given it every chance
Oh baby, all you wanna do is dance. Well you wish you were back in the good old days,
When tomatoes were cheaper,
And you never heard the words of your favorite songs
Through a three inch speaker.
And you never messed around with dangerous drugs,
You were all getting sick on beer-
And you didn't get any (unless you went steady and made out for a year). Well you can hide away honey, in your rock and roll dreams,
You can stand by your blue suede shoes-
But the party is over,
And I'm getting tired of waiting for you. Oh baby, where are the oldies they used to play?
Oh baby, you want to crawl back into yesterday,
You don't want to deal with the future,
You don't want to make any plans-
Oh baby, all you wanna do is dance. Once long ago, all the faithful held a show
Down in Elvis Presley Blvd. on Memphis Radio
Where the hopeless held a vigil and the nameless played the charts
Where the losers lost their sorrow and the lonely left their hearts Step on these shoes then I'll see you in hell, "Love me so tender" I cried
Save me a room in the "Heartbreak Hotel", I'm so alone, I could die I took a ride with my baby by my side
And the Elvis Presley Blvd. where all the faithful cried
And I saw that silent mansion and I knew that I was lost
They were selling plastic souvenirs of Elvis on the cross Step on these shoes and I'll see you in hell, "Love me so tender" I cried
Save me a room in the "Heartbreak Hotel", I'm so alone, I could die Drive down that road tonight, everyone is gone
Nobody's home but the light's always on Man I was beat, I was driven by the heat
Down to Elvis Presley Blvd. in a one-way dead end street
And I smashed my car to pieces and I said goodbye to youth
I had all the ugly rumors and I could not face the truth Save me a room in the "Heartbreak Hotel", I'm so alone, I could die Drive down that road tonight, everyone is gone
Nobody's home but the light's always on This back-breakin', bone-shakin', belly-achin', hard-workin'
Two more hours to go
Yes, it's keeping me alive doin' nine to five
And I ain't got nothin to show
Pretty soon I'll be leavin'
With the wages I'm receivin'
But I know it's gonna be all right
Come on, babe, and take me away
We got some money to spend tonight Pick me up at the station
Meet me at the train
Have a meal and a shower and a change of clothes
I can't afford a vacation
But I can take the strain
Long as I can be with you
Find a way to burn it as quickly as I earn it Yes, it's back-breakin', bone-shakin', belly-achin', hard-workin'
Two more hours to go
Seven long years for the same corporation
And I ain't got nothin' to show
And tonight when I'm leavin' I'll be just breakin' even
But I know it's gonna be all right
I shake off my blues when you put on your shoes
We got some money to spend tonight Oh, I don't wanna stand here and sound accusin'
Everybody does their share of losin'
If I'm gonna lose it I might as well be doin' it right Pick me up at the station
Meet me at the train
Have a meal and a shower and a change of clothes
I can't afford a vacation
But I can take the strain
Long as I can be with you
Find a way to burn it as quickly as I earn it Yes, it's back-breakin', bone-shakin', belly-achin', hard-workin'
Two more hours to go
Yes, it's keepin' me alive doin' nine to five
And I ain't got nothin' to show
And tonight when I'm leavin' I'll be just breakin' even
But I know it's gonna be all right
Come on, babe, and take me away
We got some money to spend tonight
Come on, babe, take me away
We got some money to spend tonight

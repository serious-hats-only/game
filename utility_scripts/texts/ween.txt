We've been together for so long,
I think I know what my soul's gotta say,
And it won't hurt as bad someday. It's gonna be alright baby,
It's gonna be alright love,
And if the mist ever lets the sun through,
I just hope I did the right thing,
For me and you. Guess I'm ruled by my heart,
Built to laugh and I tore it all apart,
It's just not our time,
But you'll find a new love and you'll be fine,
So many dark and lonely nights,
But I believe someday I'll see the light, It's gonna be alright baby,
It's gonna be alright love,
And if the mist ever lets the sun through,
I just hope I did the right thing,
For me and you. It's gonna be alright baby,
It's gonna be alright love,
And if the mist ever lets the sun through,
I just hope I did the right thing,
For me and you,
For me and you. Hi, I'm fuckin' Eddie Dingle

Doo doo doo My dinner's on fire while she watches TV
And if you ever wondered what it's like to be me
She takes all my money and leaves me no smokes
Yells at my buddies and insults my folks
I'm breakin' my back, doin' the best that I can
She's got time for the dog and none for her man
And I'm no dope, but I can't cope
So hit the fuckin' road and piss up a rope You can piss up a rope
And you can put on your shoes, hit the road, get truckin'
Pack your bag, I don't need the ag
On your knees, you big booty bitch, start suckin'
You ride my ass like a horse and a saddle
Now you're up shit's creek with a turd for a paddle
And I can't cope, piss up a rope You can piss up a rope and feel the pissy dribble
You can piss up a rope and watch me giggle
For the last six months I've been packin' your bag
You can wash my balls with a warm wet rag
Till my balls feel smooth and soft like silk
I'm sick of your mouth and your 2% milk
And I'm no dope, but I've lost all hope
So hit the fuckin' road and piss up a rope You can piss up a rope
And you can put on your shoes, hit the road, get truckin'
Pack your bag, I don't need the ag
On your knees, you big booty bitch, start suckin'
You ride my ass like a horse and a saddle
Now you're up shit's creek with a turd for a paddle
And I can't cope, piss up a rope You can piss up a rope
And you can put on your shoes, hit the road, get truckin'
Pack your bag, I don't need the ag
On your knees, you big booty bitch, start suckin'
You ride my ass like a horse and a saddle
Now you're up shit's creek with a turd for a paddle
And I can't cope, piss up a rope You can piss up a rope
And you can put on your shoes, hit the road, get truckin'
Pack your bag, I don't need the ag
On your knees, you big booty bitch, start suckin'
You ride my ass like a horse and a saddle
Now you're up shit's creek with a turd for a paddle
And I can't cope, piss up a rope It's been a while since I've seen you smile
But now you've come back again
Came into the room and you saw my girl
And you asked her how long it's been
"A year", she said and you shook your head
Said, "I'm surprised it's gone on that long" Baby, Baby, Baby Bitch
For words I am at a loss
Baby, Baby, Baby Bitch
I'm better now please fuck off What else you gonna say when while you're back on your stay
Maybe something, maybe nothing, we'll see
It's just too bad, you're beautiful I guess
I wasn't for you and you weren't for me Baby, Baby, Baby Bitch
Please slip back into yourself
Baby, Baby, Baby Bitch
Go conquer someone else People say, "How beautiful, how sweet, how kind"
You're perfect, you've got nothing to hide
But I, for one, have seen the sun
And the bitch that you've locked up inside Got fat, got angry, started hating myself
Wrote "Birthday Boy" for you babe
Now I'm skinny and sick and paranoid
Without a cent to my name Baby, Baby, Baby Bitch
Fuck you, you stinkin' ass ho
Most beauty I've seen, you come from a dream
But I can't close my eyes anymore
No, I can't close my eyes anymore
No, I can't close my eyes anymore In the morning sun, I couldn't tell you
I couldn't tell you so many things
About how much I really love you
About how much you really mean So far away but it's so easy to see you
When I'm away I want to put my arms around you
And I want to know - do you feel the same way?
'Cause if you do I want to stay forever
And I want to know - do you feel the same way?
'Cause if you do I want to stay forever
With you So many colors that surround you
Some so bright I can hardly see
A light reflects on all the things that make you real
Things that make you truly free So far away but it's so easy to see you
When I'm away I want to put my arms around you
And I want to know - do you feel the same way?
'Cause if you do I want to stay forever
And I want to know - do you feel the same way?
'Cause if you do I want to stay forever

You killed my brother last winter
you shot him three times in the back

I looked at every fiesta
for you i wanted to greet
maybe i'd sell you a chicken
with poison interlaced with the meat
You... you look like my brother
mama loved him the best
he was head honcho with the ladies
mama always said he was blessed
The village all gathered around him
they couldn't believe what they saw
i said it was you that had killed him
and that i'd find you and upstand the law
The people of the village believed me
mama... she wanted revenge
i told her i'd see that she was honored
i'd find you and put you to death
So now... now that i've found you
on this such a joyous day
i tell you it was me who killed him
but the truth i'll never have to say

Taking my prescriptions and forging my name
I was happy this morning, you finally got yourself dressed
Eating raw bacon it's okay, I was still impressed I love you even if you don't
You've got your knife up to my throat
Why do you want to see me bleed? Rooting through the garbage for treasures in the trash pile
Seeing my expression would always make you smile
Please don't touch my phone book, my friends are getting pissed off
Wake 'em in the morning and acting like a jerk off I love you even if you don't
You've got your knife up to my throat
Why do you want to see me bleed? I love you even if you don't
You've got your knife up to my throat
Why do you want to see me bleed? I love you even if you don't
You've got your knife up to my throat
Why do you want to see me bleed? Whooa, yeah, whoa, whoa, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, ahhhhhh, whoa, whoa, yeah The lights go out, the smell of doom

The bed's on fire, your fate is sealed
And you're so tired, and the reason is Camille-mille
Shockadelica
The girl must be a witch
She's got your mind, body, and soul hitched
Shockadelica
You need a second opinion
But she never wears a stitch
So you can't take her home, she's got you tied with a golden rope
She won't let you play your guitar
And when you've cried enough
Maybe she'll let you up
For a nasty ride in her Shockadeli-car
Gonna make you beg Gonna make you beg
Gonna make you spread your leg
Gonna want it, gonna get it
And you'll never regret it Talk to me lover, come on tell me what you taste
Didn't your mama tell you life is to good to waste?
Didn't she tell you that Lovesexy was the glam of them all?
If you can hang, you can trip on it
You surely won't fall
No side effects and the feeling last forever
Straight up - it tastes good
It makes you feel clever
You kiss your enemies like you know you should
Then you jerk your body like a horny pony would
You jerk your body like a horny pony would

yes I found it on the ground
emulating the ocean's sound
bring forth the mollusk cast unto me
let's be forever let forever be free Hey little boy come walk with me
and bring your new found mollusk along
does it speaketh of the trinity
can it gaze at the sun with its wandering eye
yes it speaks of the trinity
casting light at the sun with its wandering eye
bring forth the mollusk, cast unto me
let's be forever let forever be free You see there are three things that spur the mollusk from the sand
the waking of all creatures that live on the land
and with just one faint glance, back into the sea
the mollusk lingers, with it's wandering eye... At the dawn, I woke, I was alone... rising
I called upon the force of time and space... calling
And as she came, to me, I fell back down... realizing
Oh that it's cool for you to love me now... I'm everything Everything - 'cause tried and true, I see the light in you
Oh can you dig in my soul, could you smell my whole... life? You bent the edge, eclipsed, and turned around... aligning
And though the dark sparked rays of violet light... blinding
I went about the job of sowing thoughts... and feelings
Oh some were good, some bad, I felt the cries... of healing 'Cause tried and true, I see the light in you
Oh can you dig in my soul, could you smell my whole... life? Rise, my Dawn, you've been awake too long
Let me rest in time, while I blow your mind At the dawn I woke, I was alone... rising (I catch it)
I called upon the force of time and space... calling (see them)
And as she came to me, I fell back down... realizing (creation)
That it's cool for you to love me now... I'm everything (I am) Everything - 'cause tried and true, I see the light in you
Can you dig in my soul, could you smell my whole... life? You fucked up! By Ween! You fucked up, you bitch - you really fucked up

Well, you dicked me over but now you'll pay
You fucked up ... Aaaahhh! You fucked up, you bitch - you really fucked up

Well, you dicked me over but now you'll pay
You fucked up ... Aaaahhh! Well, you dicked me over but now you'll pay
You fucked up ... Aaaahhh! Transdermal celebration
Caused a slight mutation
In the rift
It toppled down a nation
And left the people running for the hills
But the mutants that I see
Shine their beauty unto me
I wish you could see them Tectonic tribulation
Formed a crust of green beyond the reef
Waves fell in formation
Cause the plants to bend with spi-ked leaves
I'm growing with the land
Time has taken my hands and let me touch them Hey, hey
A billion miles to Mark A
Lay on the lawn, he's already home
When the morning ray hits his face Transdermal celebration
Jets flew in formation
I could see them
Dropping the crustaceans
Leaving trails of flames in their wake
But where is the mutation
Who once told me it was safe, I can't find him
Hey, hey
A billion miles to Mark A
Lay on the lawn, he's already home
When the morning ray hits his face Pork roll egg and cheese on a kaiser bun

On Buckingham Green The children saw the eye
As a sign from God
Descending from the sky
It was alright to dream
Of Buckingham Green Summon the queen
Spoke the child of eye it's time to fly
Turning fire to steam
On Buckingham Green A child without an eye
Made her mother cry, why ask why?
She kept her child clean
On Buckingham Green Yesterday we lost our lives, tomorrow we were born
Fortune smiled upon us, sacrifice the Argus
All that he might help us see Magna eyes the track for miles, looking for disease
Puzzled by the mountains - tricked by the sea
and the Argus is practiced compassion
with an eye on you, as one is on me
will the god eye grant his forgiveness
and allow he that's lived, a reason to see Counting days and building walls, bells ring so's to warn
All the signs that guide us, chosen by the Argus
Tell me has chosen you Led by form we'll shed our soul
Trusting like a child
See the dark face that saved us
Drink from his empty eyes and the Argus is practiced compassion
with an eye on you, as one is on me
will the god eye grant his forgiveness
letting droplets of light erupt from the sea... Lying in beds of garlic and orchids, he closes an eye, which closes another
and in sleep he dreams, of watching and looking and feather clouds dancing
He curls up his lid and sleeps... Swirling with visions on man's confusion
All of the work, done just to appease him
The Argus he cries, though love has it's place in the sun
It's only man's fear that carries him on... Heard that you are new in town
Someone said you party down
Well, later I'll be comin' round
We'll rack 'em up and suck 'em down Don't call your mother, don't call your priest
Don't call your doctor, call the police
You bring the razor blade, I'll bring the speed
Take off your coat, it's gonna be a long night There'll be no second chance for you
Tomorrow you'll be black and blue
Show your friends your new tattoo
911 won't help you, fool You're gonna suffer, you're gonna bleed
I've heard it all before, you will concede
I'm takin' everything, you're goin' down
Lock up the doors, it's gonna be a long night It's gonna be a catfight
It's gonna be a gang-bang Don't call your mother, don't call your priest
Don't call your doctor, call the police
You bring the razor blade, I'll bring the speed
Take off your coat, it's gonna be a long night
You're gonna suffer, you're gonna bleed
I've heard it all before, you will concede
I'm takin' everything, you're goin' down
Lock up the doors, it's gonna be a long night It's gonna be a catfight
It's gonna be a gang-bang I lick my brain in silence
Rather squeeze my head instead
Midget man provoking violence
Listen not to what I said I said, please calm it down
Everything is turning brown Mutilated lips give a kiss on the wrist
Of the worm like tips of tentacles expanding in my mind
I'm fine, accepting only fresh brine
You can get another drop of this, yeah, you wish Mutilated lips give a kiss on the wrist

I'm fine, accepting only fresh brine

Did you ever seen a man with eight fingers on his hand
Did you have to dry your eye when you saw that puppy fly
Oh no, tell me it ain't so Have you ever tried to shrink like a ice cube in the sink
Have you ever tried to see what lies hidden in the tree
Have you ever made a flan and squished it in your hand
Oh no, tell me it ain't so Billy (Repeat second verse) Have you ever seen a whale with a polka dot tail
Did you ever seen a man with eight fingers on his hand
Did you have to dry your eye when you saw that puppy fly
Oh no, tell me it ain't so Help me When I find you in your sleep, Sarah
I will tell you what you mean to me, Sarah
I know this big world ain't always what it seems, Sarah
Forever may I love you, and forever may you dream, Sarah When I find you in your sleep, Sarah
I will tell you what you mean to me, Sarah Let's begin
With the past in front
And all the things
You really don't care about now
It'd be exactly where I'm at
And to think
You got a grip
Look at yourself
Your lips are like two flaps of fat
They go front and back and flappity flap I'm all staged
It's all an act
I'm really scared that I may fall back on the abstract
It'd be exactly where I'm at If you're to be
The roaming eye
Pry it open and let me tell you why it sees
The harsh realities Sitting alone in the den watching the eel
Help me find my way home watching the eel
Burrows it's head in the sand, daylight has come
There shall be rest in a while, daylight has come I can not repeal the words of the golden eel Who can explain all these thoughts racking my mind
An endless barrage of shit racking my mind
The eel offered his help I can't understand
Speaking it's truth from the bank now I can see I can not repeal the words of the golden eel
I can not repeal the words of the golden eel I can not repeal the words of the golden eel
I can not reveal the words of the golden eel
(repeat) Like a Japanese cowboy or a brother on skates
Like a blizzard in Georgia or a train runnin' late
I call out your name girl in the heat of the night
And nobody answers 'cause somethin' ain't right Breakfast at Shoney's at $2.99
Saved me some money and eased up my mind
I'm walkin' in circles and feelin' the pain
I'm tossin' and turnin' and cryin' in vain Like a Japanese cowboy or a brother on skates
Like a blizzard in Georgia or a train runnin' late
I call out your name girl in the heat of the night
And nobody answers 'cause somethin' ain't right Here we go I'm ridin' at midnight and crossin' the line
From the rain in my windshield and the tears in my eyes
Now the bedroom is empty and I spent my last dime
And the lovers are leavin', I got nothin' but time,
I got you on my mind Like a Japanese cowboy or a brother on skates
Like a blizzard in Georgia or a train runnin' late
I call out your name girl in the heat of the night
And nobody answers 'cause somethin' ain't right Yeah people come up Yeah, we better turn tha bass up on this one
Check it, since 1516 minds attacked and overseen
Now crawl amidst the ruins of this empty dream
Wit their borders and boots on top of us
Pullin' knobs on the floor of their toxic metropolis
But how you gonna get what you need ta get?
Tha gut eaters, blood drenched get offensive like Tet
Tha fifth sun sets get back reclaim
Tha spirit of Cuahtemoc alive an untamed
Now face tha funk now blastin' out ya speaker, on tha one Maya, Mexica
That vulture came ta try and steal ya name
But now you got a gun, yeah this is for the people of the sun It's comin' back around again!
This is for the people of the sun!
It's comin' back around again! Uh! It's comin' back around again!
This is for the people of the sun!
It's comin' back around again! Uh! Yeah, neva forget that tha wip snapped ya back
Ya spine cracked for tobacco, oh I'm the Marlboro man, uh
Our past blastin' on through the verses
Brigades of taxi cabs rollin' Broadway like hearses
Troops strippin' zoots, shots of red mist,
Sailors blood on tha deck, come sista resist
From tha era of terror check this photo lens,
Now tha city of angels does the ethnic cleanse
Uh, heads bobbin' to tha funk out ya speaker, on tha one Maya, Mexica
That vulture came to try and steal ya name
But now you found a gun, you're history, this is for the people of the sun It's comin' back around again!

Smiling
With the writing of Kafka in hand
And a bunny in a can
Slipping and sliding
You feel yourself asking her
Why would you want me to try...?
Squeezing your wrist and she's pulling you closer
Down where the devils are dying with laughter
Then led to a place where there's no form of pleasure
She blows you a kiss from her lips She's your baby ... Those below us can not be renounced
Cause they're talking
And for once I wish they'd shut up their mouths
Lock their doors and stay in the house
And while you're inside there
You might want to question the fact
That you're not quite the same
And look to the room where she's keeping so quiet
A million layers of crust and deposit
Blanket the seasons and bury the reasons
You told her that this was for good She's your baby Do you ever walk alone? (Do you ever walk alone?)
Like a drifter in the dark (Like a drifter in the dark)
Seeking out what isn't there (Seeking out what isn't there)
Looking only for a spark From a girl who's all alone (From a girl who's all alone)
Maybe she's a-driftin' too (Maybe she's a-driftin' too)
Like a shadow in the night (Like a shadow in the night)
Waitin' just to meet with you And then perhaps in love you'll stay (Perhaps in love you'll stay)
Or fall and go your separate ways (Fall and go your separate ways)
Still searchin' for a spark (Still searchin' for a spark)
Like a drifter in the dark Doodn doo doo doodn doo (da da da da da)

(Like a drifter in the dark) Sancho brought a message from the fat man
Sorry boy, to leave you high and dry
But I went to see my mom in Ensenada
And I left a little something to help the time go by
Just a little something to help to keep you high Bananas and blow, bananas and blow
Stuck in my cabana, living on bananas and blow Now the rainy season reminds me of Maria
The way she danced, the color of her hair
Now I'm locked inside a stall in the cantina
Eating the bananas and cocaine off the mirror
Looking for a ticket to take me away from here Bananas and blow, bananas and blow
Stuck in my cabana, living on bananas and blow
Bananas and blow, bananas and blow
Stuck in my cabana, living on bananas and blow Bananas and blow, bananas and blow
Stuck in my cabana, living on bananas and blow
Bananas and blow, oh bananas and blow
I'm stuck in my cabana, living on bananas and blow Candi - custard and berry

Candi
Candi I recall a time when we were lovers
Before you, I hadn't any other
when the bad times came along
I turned and you had gone
From the start, I loved you, I was wrong Falling out, it's the end.
May as well have never been
The cards are up, the chips are all cashed in
You won't see me again,
Don't consider me your friend
Falling out, look away, it's the end Always thought of you as my big brother
Never knew we couldn't trust eachother
Two faces I could see
As you shook my money tree
There's no more you and me
Let it be Falling out, It's the end
And I lose another friend
The cards are up, the chips are all cashed in
You won't see me again
Don't consider me your friend
Falling out, look away, it's the end. Falling out, It's the end
may as well have never been
the cards are up, the chips are all cashed in
You won't see me again
don't consider me your friend
Falling out, look away, it's the end
Falling out, look away, it's the end. Everything that you are,
that you'd like to be
Will come in three, my friend Times thine inequity
The flutes of the chi
Will sound again, my friend Wrap yourself up in gold,
The fruits of the old,
Are ripe to be told, my friend For, it's not what you are,
How you've come to be
All this will will end and begin again (solos) Everything that you are,
that you'd like to be
Will come in three, my friend Times thine inequity,
The flutes of the chi
Will sound again, my friend Take a piece of tinsel and put it on the tree
Cut a slab of melon and pretend that you still love me
Carve out a pumpkin and rely on your destiny
Get in your car and cruise the land of the brave and free But don't forget to understand exactly what you put on the tree
Don't believe the florist when he tells you that the roses are free Take a wrinkled raisin and do with it what you will
Push it into third if you know your gonna climb a hill
Eat plenty of lasagna till you know that you've had your fill
Resist all the urges that make you wanna go out and kill But don't forget to understand exactly what you put on the tree
Don't believe the florist when he tells you that the roses are free
Yeah Throw the pumpkin at the tree
Unless you think that pumpkin holds your destiny
Cast if off into the sea
Bake that pie and eat it with me Throw the pumpkin at the tree
Unless you think that pumpkin holds your destiny
Cast if off into the sea
Bake that pie and eat it with me Fluffy, furry buddy, chewed his leg on the porch
Why¹d you do it Fluffy - on the porch
Good dog Fluffy, old friend, my pal Fluffy¹s got his buddy, on the porch
Penny - she¹s my girlie, she sits here with me, on the porch
Penny looks so pretty, on the porch
Penny takes Fluffy -- for a walk -- out on the path Fluffy chases the other doggies -- on the path
The pig says to Penny get Fluffy back on the porch
So me and Fluffy and Penny are on the Porch (yeah... pain)

I think I must be dreaming The sun comes up and I'm all washed out
Is this what Deaner was talking about?
I don't think I will ever return again my friend If I was king, I'd wear a ring
And never hurt my people
I'd stay alert and dressed to kill
I might even slip you something The sun comes up and I'm all washed out
Is this what Deaner was talking about?

With the past in front
And all the things
You really don't care about now
It'd be exactly where I'm at
And to think
You got a grip
Look at yourself
Your lips are like two flaps of fat
They go front and back and flappity flap I'm all staged
It's all an act
I'm really scared that I may fall back on the abstract
It'd be exactly where I'm at If you're to be
The roaming eye
Pry it open and let me tell you why it sees
The harsh realities Strap on that there jammy pac.
Get a grip on your soul.
Sip on that there family flask,
And I'll guide you towards the door.
She don't feed me in the mornin',
And I can't take no more!
So strap on that there jammy pac,
And get up off my floor. 
Strap on that there jammy pac
And slide a double dime my way.
Dry off your distributor cap,
And hip me to the game you play.
She's jonesin' for a jammy
With a girl that I call "Tammy",
So strap on that there jammy pac,
It's time for you to pay. Strap on that there jammy pac.
She hypnotized one dude.
Stains you like a heart attack.
Van Winkle says "Fuck you."
Never made me no supper.
A boy like me needs it, too!
So strap on that thar jammy pac,
It's time to pay your due. Doodley baboo

Couldn't hide a secret from my mother
Any other mother wouldn't bother Makin' time breakin' ground
Sail brown bay to chocolate town Got me on the porch I'm in the front row
Says "shit's for real man" like I don't know
Get your punk ass back to the dog show... Makin' time breakin' ground
Sail brown bay to chocolate town A new breath I feel the grip releasin'
Scraping my guts off of the ceiling
I've got that sunny bunny feeling Makin' time breakin' ground
Sail brown bay to chocolate town
Makin' time breakin' ground
Greyhound bus to chocolate town... Never squeal on the pusher

Spinal meningitis got me down Mister, would you please help my pony?
He's over there behind the tree
He's down in the dirt would you help him?
I think it's his lung Mister, would you please help my pony?
He's chewing bark and not the leaves
He's crying like a baby, would you help him?
I think it's his lung Mister, would you please help my pony?
He's down and he ain't getting up
He coughed up snot in the driveway
And I think his lung's fucked up Pony
Pony
Pony Mister would you please help my pony?
I think it's his lung Mister, would you please help my pony?
He's over there lookin at me
He can't talk because he's a pony
I think it's his lung Mister, would you please help my pony?
He's over there behind the tree
He's down in the dirt would you help him?
I think it's his lung Cold blows the wind over my true love
Cold blows the drops of rain
I never had but one true love
And in Camville he was slain I'll do as much for my true love as any young girl may
I'll sit and weep down by his grave for twelve month and one day But when twelve months were come and gone
This young man he arose
What makes you weep down by my grave
I can't take my repose One kiss, one kiss of your lily white lips -- one kiss is all I crave
One kiss, one kiss of your lily white lips and return back to your grave My lips they are as cold as my clay
My breath is heavy and strong
If thou was to kiss my lily white lips
Thy days would not be long Oh don't you remember the garden grove where we used to walk
Pluck the finest flower of them all, twill wither to a stalk Go fetch me a nun from the dungeon deep
And water from a stone
And white milk from a maiden's breast,
That babe ere never known Go dig me a grave both long, wide and deep as quickly as you may
I'll lie down in it and take one sleep for twelve month and one day Cold blows the wind over my true love
Cold blows the drops of rain
I never had but one true love
And in Camville he was slain I'll do as much for my true love as any young girl may
I'll sit and weep down by his grave for twelve month and one day Hey there fancypants
Play the songs that make us dance
Play the tunes that make the ladies swoon
A song for all the lonely hearts, shattered dreams and broken parts
Feels like sunny days are coming soon Hey Mr. Buttercup
Spin the wheel and try your luck
The spotlight's shining bright tonight on you
Bring along your lady friend, do a dance from way back when
Tonight's the night when all your dreams come true Hey there sour grapes
Down in the dumps, long in the face
Drinkin' down your dinner, all alone
Feelin' bad, feelin' blue, tonight the rainbow ends with you
So sit on down and make yourself at home... So Hey there fancypants
Play the songs that make us dance
Play the tunes that make the ladies swoon
A song for all the lonely hearts, shattered dreams and broken parts
Feels like sunny days are coming soon Monsters that trinkle like cats in the night
The cosmic conceiver continues his plight
A war of the heavens, what's wrong and what's right
Right to the ways and the rules of the world
Right to the ways and the rules of the world Spraying the children with incense and myrrh
The hopeless confessions of minds unsure
Spraying the children with incense and myrrh
Right to the ways and the rules of the world
Right to the ways and the rules of the world I tried to come over and see you today
I tried to come over to want you to say
I wanted you say to come today
Right to the ways and the rules of the world
Right to the ways and the rules of the world Mindlessly hoping she falls for their minds
Holding the sacraments, secrets unkind
Chewing the curdles of cream from the rain
Right to the ways and the rules of the world
Chewing the grits...
Right to the ways and the rules of the world Monsters that tinkle, trinkle like the jam's gone astray...

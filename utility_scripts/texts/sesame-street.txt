Well, I'd like to visit the moon
On a rocket ship high in the air
Yes, I'd like to visit the moon
But I don't think I'd like to live there
Though I'd like to look down at the earth from above
I would miss all the places and people I love
So although I might like it for one afternoon
I don't want to live on the moon
I'd like to travel under the sea
I could meet all the fish everywhere
Yes, I'd travel under the sea
But I don't think I'd like to live there
I might stay for a day there if I had my wish
But there's not much to do when your friends are all fish
And an oyster and clam aren't real family
So I don't want to live in the sea
I'd like to visit the jungle, hear the lions roar
Go back in time and meet a dinosaur
There's so many strange places I'd like to be
But none of them permanently
So if I should visit the moon
Well, I'll dance on a moonbeam and then
I will make a wish on a star
And I'll wish I was home once again
Though I'd like to look down at the earth from above
I would miss all the places and people I love
So although I may go I'll be coming home soon
'Cause I don't want to live on the moon
No, I don't want to live on the moon

You know that I am called the Count
Because I really love to count
I could sit and count all day
Sometimes I get carried away
I count slowly, slowly, slowly getting faster
Once I've started counting it's really hard to stop
Faster, faster. It is so exciting!
I could count forever, count until I drop
1! 2! 3! 4!
1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4,
1-2, i love couning whatever the ammount haha!
1-2-3-4, heyyayayay heyayayay that's the sound of the count
I count the spiders on the wall...
I count the cobwebs in the hall...
I count the candles on the shelf...
When I'm alone, I count myself!
I count slowly, slowly, slowly getting faster
Once I've started counting it's really hard to stop
Faster, faster. It is so exciting!
I could count forever, count until I drop
1! 2! 3! 4!
1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4, 1,2 I love counting whatever the ammount! 1-2-3-4 heyayayay heayayay 1-2-3-4
That's the song of the Count!

[Anything Muppet #1: Hello.]
[Bob: Hey, listen, know who you could be if I gave you this little hat and this bag to go over your shoulder?]
[Anything Muppet #1: I could be a laundry man.]
[Bob: No, not a laundry man.]
[Anything Muppet #1: How about Santa Claus?]
[Bob: No no no, not Santa Claus.]
[Anything Muppet #1: What's wrong with Santa Claus?]
[Bob: There's nothing wrong with Santa Claus, but...]
[Anything Muppet #1: Don't you like Christmas?]
[Bob: Oh, I love Christmas. But you could be the postman.]
[Anything Muppet #1: A postman, hmmmm ...]
Oh, the postman always brings the mail
Through rain or snow or sleet or hail
I'll work and work the whole day through
To get your letters safe to you
Bob and Anything Muppet #1:
'Cause a postman is a person in your neighborhood
In your neighborhood
He's in your neighborhood
A postman is a person in your neighborhood
A person that you meet each day
[Anything Muppet #1: I'll see you around.]
[Bob: Okay.]
(AM#1 leaves, bumped into AM#2 as he enters)
[Anything Muppet #2: Hey, watch it. Where ya goin'? To a fire?]
[Bob: Hey, speaking of a fire.]
[Anything Muppet #2: Fire! What fire? Help! Help!]
[Bob: No, there's no fire at all. But do you know who you could be if I gave you this little shiny red hat?]
[Anything Muppet #2: Yeah, Santa Claus.]
[Bob: No, not Santa Claus.]
[Anything Muppet #2: Little Red Riding Hood?]
[Bob: No, no, no, not Red Riding Hood, you could be a fireman.]
[Anything Muppet #2: A fireman? Holy smoke!]
Oh, a fireman is brave it's said
His engine is a shiny red
If there's a fire anywhere about
Well, I'll be sure to put it out
Bob and Anything Muppet #2:
'Cause a fireman is a person in your neighborhood
In your neighborhood
He's in your neighborhood
Anything Muppet #1:
And a postman is a person in your neighborhood
All:
Well, they're the people that you meet
When you're walking down the street
They're the people that you meet each day

(pic of Cookie Monster dressed in a chef hat and apron behind the counter of a bakery, muching cookies, natch)
The baker is the one who makes
Your bread and rolls and pies and cakes
If you want something sweet to eat, go see
The baker in the bakery
(pic of Guy Smiley-like teacher in front of class holding a globe)
A teacher works the whole day through
To teach important things to you
He'll teach you things you won't forget
Like numbers and the alphabet
(pic of Herry monster in red-white striped pants just like a barber's pole cutting the hair of Guy Smiley-like muppet)
A barber has a great big chair
You sit in it, he cuts your hair
He'll snip and clip and never rest
Until your haircut looks its best
(pic of Prairie Dawn-like muppet driving a bus)
The bus driver drives fast or slow
To take you where you want to go
When you get in and pay your fare
She will drive you anywhere
(pic of Telly wearing a dentist's uniform)
A dentist cares for all your teeth
The top ones and the ones beneath
So if you have an aching tooth
He'll fix it quick, and that's the truth
(pic of female muppet in a doctor's uniform)
The doctor makes you well real quick
If by chance you're feeling sick
She works and works the whole day long
To help you feel well and strong
(pic of blue adult male muppet in grocer's outfit)
The grocer sells the things you eat
Like bread and eggs, cheese and meat
No matter what you're looking for
You'll find it at the grocery store
(pic of Grover working on a shoe with a hammer)
The shoemaker is always there
To take care of the shoes you wear
With his hammer, nails, and glue
He'll fix your shoes as good as new
(pic of the back of Rodeo Rosie handing over a fringed vest to the drycleaner, a green adult male muppet)
The cleaner is the one who knows
How to clean and press your clothes
He'll take a jacket, suit, or vest
And clean it so you'll look your best
(pic of Oscar The Grouch, naturally, driving a garbage truck)
The trash collector works each day
He'll always take your trash away
He drives the biggest truck you've seen
To keep the city streets all clean
Somebody come and play
Somebody come and play today
Somebody come and smile the smiles
And sing the songs
It won't take long
Somebody come and play today
Somebody come and play
Somebody come and play my way
Somebody come and rhyme the rhymes
And laugh the laughs
It won't take time
Somebody come and play today
Somebody come with me and see the pleasure in the wind
Somebody come before it gets too late to begin
Somebody come and play
Somebody come and play today
Somebody come and be my friend
And watch the sun 'til it rains again
Somebody come and play today
First your fingers snap
And then your toes start tappin'
Give your knees a slap
And let your hands start clappin'
Anything can happen when you're happy tappin' with Elmo
Don't need a map to find the King of Tappin'
I'm the reddish chap
The one whose arms are flappin'
People, it's a snap
So try some happy tappin' with Elmo
Happy's such a neat emotion
It'll give your feet a happy notion
If your toes get tired rub in some lotion
And they'll feel swell, so, come join Elmo
You'll be happy when you see me tappin'
Better make it snappy, don't get caught nappin'
Tell your mam and pappy that you're happy tappin' with Elmo
Happy tappin' with Elmo
Happy's such a neat emotion
It'll give your feet that happy notion
If your toes get tired rub in some lotion
And they'll feel swell, so, come join Elmo
You'll be happy when you see me tappin'
Better make it snappy, don't get caught nappin'
Tell your mam and pappy that you're happy tappin' with Elmo
Happy tappin' with Elmo
Yeah!
My hair is black and red
My hair is yellow
My eyes are brown and green and blue
My name is Jack and Fred
My name's Amanda Sue
I'm called Kareem Abdul
My name is you
I live in southern France
I'm from a Texas ranch
I come from Mecca and Peru
I live across the street
In the mountains, on a beach
I come from everywhere
And my name is you
We all sing with the same voice
The same song, the same voice
We all sing with the same voice
And we sing in harmony
Sometimes I get mad and mean
Sometimes I feel happy
And when I want to cry, I do
When I'm by myself at night
I hold my teddy tight
Until the morning light
My name is you
I have sisters one, two, three
In my family there's just me
I've got one daddy
I've got two
Grandpa helps me cross the street
My cat walks on furry feet
I love my parakeet
My name is you
We all sing with the same voice
The same song, the same voice
We all sing with the same voice
And we sing in harmony
I like to run and climb
I like to sit and read
I like to watch my TV, too
And when it's time for bed
I like my stories read
"Sweet dreams" and "Love you" said
My name is you
We all sing with the same voice
The same song, the same voice
We all sing with the same voice
And we sing in harmony
It's a rainy day;
It's a rainy day.
It's raining outside,
And I can't go out and play.
Why do we need the rain anyway?
Rain falls everywhere,
Fills the rivers and streams,
Flows into the reservoirs
Purified and clean.
Water to do the wash,
Water to drink,
Water is flowing
Through the pipes into our sink.
It's a rainy day;
It's a rainy day.
It's raining outside,
And I can't go out and play.
I guess I'll stay at home today.
Every living thing needs water;
Every living thing needs the rain.
Every living thing needs water;
I guess I really can't complain.
It's a rainy day;
It's a rainy day.
It's raining outside,
And I can't go out and play.
Why do we need the rain anyway?
Water to do the dishes,
Water to brush your teeth,
Water to take a shower,
Water to wash the street.
Water for the forest,
Millions of thirsty roots;
Water for the garden,
Flowers, vegetables, and fruits.
It's a rainy day;
It's a rainy day.
It's raining outside,
And I can't go out and play.
Don't you know I love the rain anyway?!
Ernie: Do you like me?
Am I okay?
Do you like me?
If you do please say,
That you like me,
Just this way.
I want to hear it from you.
Bert: (Oh, Ernie.)
Ernie: (No, really, Bert.)
Ernie: Do you like me?
Do you think I'm swell?
Do you like me?
You know me well,
If you like me.
Won't you tell?
I want to hear it from you.
We always have a super time,
When we play and sing a song.
But I wonder if you still like me,
Even when I do things wrong?
Bert: (Oh, Ernie.)
Bert: Yes, I like you.
Ernie: (Really?)
Bert: That is right.
Oh I like you.
Ernie: (Oh good!)
Bert: Can you turn out the light?
I like you.
Now can we say good night?
Ernie: (Good night!)
Bert: Now that you've heard it from me.
Ernie: (Oh gee, thanks Bert. I think I can sleep now.)
Bert: (Ahh, that's good. Good night.)
Ernie: (Goodnight! (pause) Oh, but, ah, Bert?)
Bert: (Ernie, what?)
Ernie: (I like you, too, Bert.)
Bert: (Oh ... (mutter))
ABC-DEF-GHI-JKL-MNOP-QRSTUV-WXYZ
It's the most remarkable word I've ever seen
ABC-DEF-GHI-JKL-MNOP-QRSTUV-WXYZ
I wish I knew exactly what I mean
It starts out like an "A" word as anyone can see
But somewhere in the middle it gets awful "QR" to me
ABC-DEF-GHI-JKL-MNOP-QRSTUV-WXYZ
If I ever find out just what this word can mean
I'll be the smartest bird the world has ever seen!
It might be kind of an elephant
Or a funny kind of kazoo
Or strange, exotic turtle
You never see in a zoo
Or maybe a kind of a doggie
Or particular shade of blue
Or maybe a pretty flower
Naah, not with a name like that, Uh uh!

(One, two, three, four, five, six, seven!)
Said the Alligator King to his seven sons,
"I'm feelin' mighty down.
Whichever of you can cheer me up
Will get to wear my crown."
His first son brought seven oyster pearls
From the bottom of the China Sea.
The second gave him seven statues of girls
With clocks where their stomachs should be.
The third son gave him seven rubies
From the sheikdom down there beneath.
The King thought the rubies were cherries,
And he broke off seven of his teeth.
The fourth son tried to cheer him up
With seven lemon drops.
The King said...
"I'm sorry son, since that ruby episode,
I just haven't got the chops."
The fifth son brought the King perfume
In seven fancy silver jars;
The King took a whiff, and he broke out in spots
'Cause it smelled like cheap cigars.
The sixth son gave him seven diamond rings
To wear upon his toes.
The King snagged his foot on the royal red rug
And crumpled up his nose.
The seventh son of the Alligator King
Was a thoughtful little leal.
He said...
"Daddy, appears to me like you could use
a little help."
Said the Alligator King to his seventh son,
"My son, you win the crown.
You didn't bring me diamonds or rubies,
But you helped me up when I was down.
Take the crown; it's yours, my son.
Hope you don't mind the dents.
I got it on sale at a discount store,
Cost me all of seven cents!"
(Seven!)
Sometimes I have trouble
Falling asleep
But it's not so bad
(Not again)
I don't worry
(Ooooooh)
And I don't weep
In fact I'm glad...
Be-cause I get up off my pillow
And I flip on the li-ight
(Turn the light back off!)
I get down and get hip
In the still of the night
I stretch and I yawn and then I breathe real deep
(Ernie!)
And dance myself to sleep!
(Ooooh, why me?)
I hoof around my beddie
Just a-tappin my toes
Before I know what's happenin'
I'm a-ready to doze
(Oooh...)
Got some partners I can count on called the Boogie Woogie Sheep
(What?!?)
I dance myself to sleep!
(I don't believe this!)
I gently rock-a-bye myself across the floor
(Ernie!)
I turn and then I toss and then I start to snore
(Ernie!)
My trusty little bugle helps me spread the news
That I'm tappin' to "Taps"
And I'm a-rarin' to snooze!
(Oh, not the bugle)
(Smokin' bugle routine by Ernie begins, interspersed with comments by Bert)
(Ernie...
Those sheep are tap dancing!
Oooh, why me?)
(Ernie removes the bugle from his lips ... yet the bugle routine continues! Wild!)
Spoken: Oh, that's nothing, Bert, wait 'till you see Rubber Duckie play the bugle!
Watch this Rubber Duckie, he's the Boogie-Woogie Bugle Duck of Sesame Street!
(Ernie holds his duckie up to the bugle, squeezes his tummy and the bugle routine really heats up!)
(bugle solo ends)
(the sheep now begin to carry Bert and his bed out of the room)
(Ernie! Ernie! Your sheep!)
Well, I'm gettin' kinda drowsy
(Your sheep! Call them off, please! Hey!)
So the moment has come
To grab my rubber duckie
(Oooh, not outside! Please!)
While the sheep take my chum
Time to shuffle off to dreamland
(Not outside sheep! Errrrnie!)
Got a date to keep
We'll dance ourselves to sleep, oh yeah
(Errrrnie!)
We'll dance ourselves to sleep
Wearin' our jammies
We'll dance ourselves to sleep
And thank you, lambies
We'll dance ourselves to sleep!
(final bugle riff)
(Ernie's trademark laugh, as Bert looks in from window with long-suffering expression)
Ernie: Hey everybody! I'm going on a tiger hunt! I've got my trusty rusty telescope right here (squeaking noises in background). You wanna come along? Well, let's go then. (sound of door opening)
A tiger hunt can be fun, you just do what I do. Now first we're gonna walk down this road. Of course, you're not really on a road but you can pretend. Just stand up and walk around the room or walk in place without really going anywhere. Come on now, everybody walk. Are you walking with me? Good!
Okay, now we've got to climb this hill. Oh ... hee ... this is hard. Are you climbing with me? Good. There now here we are at the top of the hill. And now we can run down! Are you running with me? Okay!
Watch out there's a fence at the bottom of the hill, we'll have to jump it ... Alley-oop! We made it! Oh oh, we're here. we're walking through the tiger jungle. Oh boy. Oh there are a lot of mosquitoes here! Shoo mosquitoes! Shoo those mosquitoes away! Oh there's some on my arm. Slap those mosquitoes if they land on you. There, that's better.
Hey look, we've come to a big thicket of thorns. We're gonna have to crawl on our tummies to get through these thorns. You crawling with me? Good! Oops, I'm caught on a thorn (ripping sound) ooh ... there. Now we can get up because we're at the other side of the thicket and ... what is this?
We've come to the great jungle river! We're gonna have to swim for it. Ready to dive into the water? Ready, get set, jump! (splashing sounds) Here we go, swimming across the river! Oh my trusty rusty telescope is going to get even rustier. There, there, we made it. Okay, walk up on to the river bank. Here, oh look over there. It's a bunch of elephants. We'd better tiptoe past them. Are you tiptoeing with me? Good! There, okay now we're past the elephants. We should be near the tiger's house. Let's climb that tree so we can look around. You climbing with me? Okay. Here we go. All right, now here we are high in the tree. Let's look through my trusty rusty telescope and try to find that tiger. Look to the right. Look to the left. Look down ... hmmm ... I don't see a tiger.
Mr. Tiger: Good afternoon!
Ernie: Oops. There's a big furry striped animal in this tree with us.
Mr. Tiger: Roar!
Ernie: It's a tiger! RUN! Climb down the tree as fast as you can. He's following us - Run! Tiptoe past the elephants. Run down the river bank. Swim the jungle river. Climb up and cross through the thicket of thorns. Then slap the mosquitoes away. And run through the jungle. Now jump over the fence. Now run up the hill. Now run down the hill. Now open the door and (sound of door closing) ooh ... ahh ... we made it ... we're home ...
Bert: Hey, hi Ernie. Where you been?
Ernie: Oh Bert, don't ask!
(knocking on door)
Bert: Oh, I'll get it Ernie.
(sound of door opening)
Mr. Tiger: Roar!
Bert: Hi, Mr. Tiger. What do you want?
Mr. Tiger: Ernie forgot his trusty rusty telescope in my jungle!
(door closes)
Ernie: Oh, oh Bert!
Well, me known for eating cookie,
When me don't, they shout,
"Look, he trying to throw loyal fans a curve!
What he doing eating fish,
Or vegetable dish?
Man, he sure got a lot of nerve!"
Well, me answer you straight,
When me filling up plate,
Taking only cookies is all wrong!
'Cause you also got to eat
Fruit or veggies and meat
If you want to be healthy and strong!
Word up! ( not in this translation, but CM does say this on the video )
(Chorus)
Healthy food!
Boy, it taste so good.
Me one healthy dude
'Cause me eat healthy food.
Me love it boiled or stewed,
Me love it whole or chewed.
You'd feel just great if you'd
Eat some healthy food!
Me promise that when you eat varied menu,
You get more out of every meal.
You need balanced diet,
Come on and try it!
Not believe how great you'll feel!
Munch some carrots or beans
Or poultry or greens,
Along with your chocolate chip.
And banana or plum
Will make you go, "Yum!"
Nutrition--- it really hip!
( repeat chorus )
There broiled spring chicken,
Grapes ripe for picking,
And swordfish, tuna and trout.
And apple and cherry,
And all kinds of berry,
And broccoli and Brussel sprout!
There lettuce, tomato,
Boiled new potato,
There spinach and celery and beet.
Milk and honey and cheese,
Peanuts, peppers, and peas,
Pears and peaches and cream of wheat!
( repeat chorus twice )
Bob: I've got two eyes, one, two
They're both the same size, one, two

Two hands have I, they can wave goodbye
Gordon: Two arms have I, I can hold them up high
Susan: I've got two ears, they help me hear
Bob: I've got two eyes...and they're both the same size
Oscar the Grouch: I've got two knees, one, two
They're as round as you please. one, two
I've got two knees, they're as round as you please
Mr. Hooper: Two hands have I, they can wave goodbye
Gordon: Two arms have I, I can hold them up high
Susan: I've got two ears, they help me hear
Bob: I've got two eyes...and they're both the same size
Big Bird: I've got two feet, one, two
They can walk down the street, one, two

Oscar: I've got two knees, they're as round as you please
Mr. Hooper: Two hands have I, they can wave goodbye
Gordon: Two arms have I, I can hold them up high
Susan: I've got two ears, they help me hear...
(pause, then..)
Everybody: We've got two eyes...and they're both the same size
Amazingly
Beautiful
Creatures
Dancing
Excites the
Forest
Glade, in my
Heart how
I do
Jump like the
Kudo
Listen to the
Music so
Nice the
Organ
Plays.
Quietly
Rests the
Sleepy
Tiger
Under the
Vine tree at the
Water's side and
X marks the spot 'neith the
Yellow moon where the
Zulu king and I did hide.
Henry: There's a hole in the bucket, dear Liza, dear Liza,
There's a hole in the bucket, dear Liza, a hole.
Liza: So fix it dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry,
So fix it dear Henry, dear Henry, fix it.
H: With what should I fix it, dear Liza, dear Liza,
With what should I fix it, dear Liza, with what?
L: With a stick, dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry,
With a stick, dear Henry, dear Henry, with a stick.
H: But the stick is too big, dear Liza, dear Liza,
The stick is too big, dear Liza, too big.
L: So cut it dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry,
So cut it dear Henry, dear Henry, cut it!
H: With what should I cut it, dear Liza, dear Liza,
With what should I cut it, dear Liza, with what?
L: Use the hatchet, dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry,
Use the hatchet, dear Henry, the hatchet.
H: But the hatchet's too dull, dear Liza, dear Liza,
The hatchet's too dull, dear Liza, too dull.
L: So, sharpen it, dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry,
So sharpen it dear Henry, dear Henry, sharpen it!
H: With what should I sharpen it, dear Liza, dear Liza,
With what should I sharpen, dear Liza, with what?
L: Use the stone, dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry,
Use the stone, dear Henry, dear Henry, THE STONE!!!!
H: But the stone is too dry, dear Liza, dear Liza,
The stone is too dry, dear Liza, too dry.
L: So wet it, dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry,
So wet it dear Henry, dear Henry, WET IT!
H: With what should I wet it, dear Liza, dear Liza,
With what should I wet it, dear Liza, with what?
L: (moves her rocking chair over to Henry and sings fast)
With water, dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry,
With water, dear Henry, dear Henry, WATER!!!!!
H: With what should I carry it, dear Liza, dear Liza,
With what should I carry it dear Liza, with what?
L: (crying)
Use the bucket dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry,
Use the bucket, dear Henry, dear Henry, the bucket!
H: Uh, Liza????
There's a hole in the bucket, dear Liza, dear Liza,
There's a hole in the bucket, dear Liza, a hole.
At this point Liza takes the chair and goes off to live with her mother which is probably what Henry wanted in the first place!
** The original version has the bucket to be thatched with hay that ends up being too long and needs to be cut with a knife that ends up being too dull instead of the Sesame Street version that replaces this with plugging the hole with a stick that needs to be cut down because it is too big, but the hatchet ends up being too dull to do the work.
Bert's alone in bed, Ernie's bed is empty and Bert says:
This is great! Ernie's sleeping over at The Count's tonight so I have the place all to myself. For once, I know he's not going to wake me up. No surprises, just peace and quiet. I'll just settle in under my blanket and go to sleep.
Music starts playing
Perhaps I spoke too soon!
Door opens and sheep start coming in the room
Sheep: Baaa, come on he's not asheep yet!
We just thought you might like to know where your blanket came from.
Bert: My blanket? I know where my blanket came from!
Sheep: A blanket begins in a faraway place
Where skies are blue and there's lots of space
The nights are cold and we sleep outside
To keep warm and toasty we grow hair on our hide
But when spring comes round the weather is warm
A thick woolly coat loses all of its charm
We're itchy and hot 'till the rancher arrives
To give us each a haircut and brighten up our lives
He grabs a big bag and he gathers the wool
And he stuffs and he crams 'till the bags are full
He throws 'em on the truck 'till it's piled up high
Then he climbs into the driver's seat and says "goodbye"
That's the story of Bert's blanket
That's the story of Bert's blanket
That's the story of Bert's blanket
Bert: Hey sheep! Hey sheep, aren't ya going to tell what happens next?
Sheep: Oh so I suppose someone waves a magic wand and POOF!
Our wool turns into a blanket and lands on your beeeeeed
Bert: Nooooo, that's not what happens to your wool. Now listen,
It goes to a mill before it lands in bed
'Cause it's gotta be twirled into long strong thread
Then it's gotta get dyed to a nice dull grey
Then woven into cloth before it's sent on its way
Get the picture?
Sheep: Yes we see
Bert: Well there's more
A few more touches and it goes to a store
Where it's put on a shelf, it's not long before
A warm grey blanket catches someone's eye
He says "Hey, that's the blanket I've been longing to buy!"
Sheep: Well I'll be dagnabbed. So that's what happens!
Bert: So when you climb in bed before you go to sleep
As you snuggle in your covers please think of these sheep
Sheep: We'll be back on the range and doing our beeeest
To keep those blankets coming from our ranch in the weeest
That's the story of Bert's blanket (repeated)
Bert: Hey it's kinda late for you guys to be heading for your ranch,
There's plenty of room here if you'd like to sleep over,
See no one's using Ernie's bed. Huh?
Sheep: Oh great, sounds great, thanks!
Bert, as the sheep start piling into his bed: No, Ernie's bed, not my bed!
Bert just sighs and gives in.
Two and two are four
Four and four are eight
That's all you have on your business-like mind
Two and two are four
Four and four are eight
How can you be so blind
sung in counterpoint:
Two and two are four
Four and four are eight
Eight and eight are sixteen
Sixteen and sixteen are thirty-two
Inchworm, inchworm
Measuring the marigolds
You and your arithmetic
You'll probably go far
Inchworm, inchworm
Measuring the marigolds
Seems to me you'd stop and see
How beautiful they are
Sometimes I imagine
That I would like to be
A knight in shining armor
In a castle by the sea
A knight in shining armor with a princess by my side
I'd have a magic feather and a horse that I could ride
And the king would say, "Sir Ernie, you're so handsome and so brave
Please rid us of this dragon breathing fire in his cave"
And I'd get on my horse and I'd start to ride
I'd travel my way through the countryside
I'd come at last to the dragon's cave
And I'd yell, "Mr. Dragon, you'd better behave!"
And the dragon would be so scared of me
That he'd run away, and the kingdom would be free!
And I'd tip my hat
Imagine that
Imagine thaaaaaaaat
Imagine that!
Sometimes I imagine
That I would like to be
A daring bold explorer
Sailing far across the sea
I'd set out on a sailing ship to find a distant land
I'd gaze across the ocean with my telescope in hand
And the captain would say, "Ernie, there's a big storm drawing near,
You're our finest bravest sailor; you must grab the wheel and steer!"
And I'd grab the wheel in the wind and rain
I'd steer the ship through the hurricane
I'd guide the ship with a steady hand
I'd lead the way toward a brand new land
I'd spy the land lying safe and near
And I'd cry "Land-ho!", and the crew would cheer!
And I'd tip my hat
Imagine that
Imagine thaaaaaaat
Imagine that!
Sometimes I imagine
That I would like to be
A person who's named Ernie
Who looks quite a lot like me
Who likes the things that I like
And who does the things I do
And I don't have to imagine
Because I'm Ernie!
Me, that's who!
(nifty Ernie laugh)
And I'd tip my hat
Imagine that
Imagine thaaaaaaat
Imagine that!
Why are there so many songs about rainbows
And what's on the other side?
Rainbows are visions, but only illusions,
And rainbows have nothing to hide.
So we've been told and some choose to believe it
I know they're wrong, wait and see.
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection,
The lovers, the dreamers and me.
Who said that every wish would be heard and answered
When wished on the morning star?
Somebody thought of that
And someone believed it,
And look what it's done so far.
What's so amazing that keeps us stargazing?
And what do we think we might see?
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection,
The lovers, the dreamers and me.
All of us under its spell,
We know that it's probably magic....
Have you been half asleep
And have you heard voices?
I've heard them calling my name.
Is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailors?
The voice might be one and the same.
I've heard it too many times to ignore it.
Is it something that I'm supposed to be?
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection,
The lovers, the dreamers and me.
La, la la, La, la la la, La Laa, la la, La, La la laaaaaaa
(reprise from "The Muppet Movie"):
Why are there so many songs about rainbows?
That's part of what rainbows do.
Rainbows are memories, sweet dream reminders --
What is it you'd like to do?
All of us watching and wishing we'd find it,
I know you're watching it, too.
Someday you'll find it, the rainbow connection,
The lovers, the dreamers, and you!

Waylon Jennings: So you are the bird on the run, huh?
Big Bird: Oh, yeah! And I can't wait to get back to my real home on Sesame Street! I figure I can walk back there in, oh, about, uh, three hours.
Jennings: Three hours? More like three weeks, buddy.
Big Bird: Three weeks? Oh, no! I'll never get home.
Jennings: Sure you will. You just gotta keep going. Pick up your feet and follow your beak.
Big Bird: Oh, I don't know.
Jennings: Listen to me, son.
(sung)
I found out a long time ago
You gotta learn to say "yes" when life says "no"
Don't dwell on the bad times once they're past
That kind of thinking gets you nowhere fast
'Cause there ain't no mountain you can't climb
If you hang on tight and just make up your mind
Once you set your heart to movin' on
Son, there ain't no road too long
(Gordon, Olivia, and Cookie Monster are in a yellow Volkswagen, looking for Big Bird. Gordon is driving. They're all singing, unless it says otherwise.)
Gordon: Don't look back; don't you turn around!
Olivia: Just keep your eye on where you're bound!
Gordon and Olivia: And you're bound to get from here to there
'Cause a dream can take you anywhere!
Cookie Monster (spoken): Oh! Take me to cookies!
Super Grover: 'Cause there ain't no mountain you can't climb
If you hang on tight and just make up your mind
Count von Count: And once you set your heart to moving on, hut, hut
Then there is no road too long!
(Spoken) And you can count the telephone poles! One telephone pole, two telephone poles, three telephone poles, four telephone poles!
(Oscar is driving Maria and Telly in his Sloppy Jalopy. Maria is looking at a road map.)
(spoken)
Maria: Oscar, this isn't Route 12!
Oscar : Picky, picky, picky.
Telly: Oh, no!
Maria (as the Sloppy Jalopy lurches down a rolling field): Oh, oh!
Oscar: I never promised you a rose garden!
(Ernie is piloting Bert in an airplane as they look for Big Bird)
Ernie: Oh, we're gonna find him all right, Bert!
Bert: Yeah.
Ernie: Hey, you remember what color he is?
Bert: What?
Ernie: He's yellow!
Bert: Ernie!
(Ernie laughs and flies right over the truck without seeing Big Bird!)
(sung)
Big Bird: 'Cause there ain't no mountain you can't climb
If you hang on tight and just make up your mind!
And once you set your heart to movin' on
Yeah, there ain't no road too long
Jennings: Ain't no mountain you can't climb!
Big Bird (spoken): That's right!
Jennings: If you hang on tight and just make up your mind!
Big Bird (spoken): Uh huh!
Jennings: Once you set your heart to movin' on!
Big Bird (spoken): Sing it!
Jennings: There ain't no road too long!
There ain't no road too long!
Big Bird: There ain't no road too long!
Jennings: No, there ain't no road too long!
Big Bird (spoken): You're right! If I just keep on going, everything will turn out fine.

Ernie: [Hi, Bert.]
Bert: [Oh. Hi, Ernie. Hey, I've been sitting here trying to think of what we can do with this here, letter "L".]
Ernie: [Oh. Well, let's see. You know one thing, you can sing sort of a "La La La" song with the letter "L".]
Bert: [Uh, what do you mean?]
Ernie: [Well, there are all kinds of pretty words that begin with "L".] (Music starts.) [You know, you can sing a few "La La La's" and some pretty words, and you'd have a nice little song.]
Bert: ["La La La," like that?]
Ernie: [Sure. Go ahead. Try it.]
Bert: [O.K. Let's see, uh,.]
La, la, la, la . . . lemon
La, la, la, la, light bulb
Ernie: [Uh-huh.]

La, la, la, la, lump in my oatmeal
Ernie: [Well, that's not quite what I was thinking about, Bert.]
Bert: [No?]
Ernie: [I mean there are a lot of pretty "L" words, and I was sort of thinking of the ones that are more lilting and lovely. You know like...]
La, la, la, la, laughter
Bert: [Oh, yeah. I see.]
Ernie: La, la, la, la, lullaby
Bert: [Oh, like that. Huh?]
Ernie: La, la, la, la, lollypop
Bert: [Ahhhhhh!]
Ernie: La, la, la, la, lights in the sky.
Bert: [Oh! Oh! Ernie, I've got a GREAT "L" word! This is a beauty. Oh, listen to this.]
La, la, la, LINOLEUM!
Ernie: [Ah, no, Bert, uh.]
Listen to me
'Cause "L" is such a lovely letter
For words like "licorice" and "lace"
The letter "L" lights up your face
So why not la, la, la, la, laaaaaaaaaaaaah...
Bert: La, la, la, la, laaaaaaah

I can't think of anything that's dumber
To a grouch, Christmas is a bummer!
Beaming faces everywhere, happiness is in the air
I'm telling you, it isn't fair!
I hate Christmas!
People loaded with good will, giving presents, what a thrill
That slushy nonsense makes me ill
I hate Christmas!
I'd rather have a holiday like normal grouches do
Instead of getting presents, they take presents back from you
Heh heh
Here comes Santa, girls and boys
So, who needs that big red noise!
I'll tell him where to put his toys
I hate Christmas!
(spoken): And if you want the truth, I ain't so crazy about Thanksgiving or Labor Day either!
Christmas carols to be sung, decorations to be hung
Oh, yeah? Well, I stick out my tongue!
I hate Christmas!
Christmas bells play loud and strong
Hurts my ears, all that ding dong
Besides it goes on much too long
I hate Christmas!
I'd rather have a holiday with a lot less joy and flash
With a lot less cheerful smiling, and a lot more dirty trash, yeah!
Christmas Day is almost here
When it's over, then I cheer
I'm glad it's only once a year
I hate Christmas!
I eat with chopsticks
Can you eat with chopsticks
Just pick up your chopsticks

Two little sticks
They're made out of wood

To pick up your lunch
Your lunch

A bunch to munch
Eat noodles with chopsticks
Eat dumplings with chopsticks
Eat sushi with chopsticks

Don't eat soup with your chopsticks
That's no good with chopsticks
And jello will slide off
Your dish

Some folks try to tell you there are things you shouldn't do
You're not strong enough or smart enough at all,
But what seems right to them quite often
Might be wrong for you,
So be sure you try to climb
Before you get too scared you fall.
Oh, you can be what you want to be,
Learn what you want to learn,
Believe in yourself,
Believe in yourself.
Try what you need to try,
No one should question why,
Believe in yourself,
Believe in yourself.

That you've gone and lost your senses,
But the world is yours to walk in,
Go ahead and leap the fences.

Ten tiny turtles on the telephone
Talking to the grocery man
"We would like some lettuce,
Will you send us ten heads please,
And ten sweet potatoes
And ten rutabagas with the dimples on their knees.
And send us 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Artichokes
Ten eggplants, over easy
That's one of our little jokes ( ha ha ha )
Ten leafy, leafy collard greens
And please make sure they're washed!
Light up our eyes
Brighten our lives
With ten banana squash.
We'll need ten cans of black-eyed peas
They give you good strong muscles
Ten of those tasty sprouts
The ones that they call brussel's
We'd also like ten mangoes
They're the favorite of our sister Gert
And one last thing
Please do include ten apples for dessert!
10! "

Guy Smiley: Hi, this is Guy Smiley, and this here is Adrian. (Adrian is a cute, orange, lady muppet, he hugs her)
Adrian: (giggle) Hello!
Guy: Adrian starts with the letter A, just like the alphabet. Here's a song about the way I feel about her.
(Guy and Adrian start walking past a row of alphabet blocks. As he sings, he tosses each block to the ground.)
Guy: (sings) A, you're adorable
B, you're so beautiful
C, you're a cutie full of charms
D, you're a darling
And E, you're exciting
And F, you're a feather in my arms
Adrian: (giggles) A feather-that tickles!
Guy: G, you look good to me
H, you're so heavenly
I, you're the one I idolize
J, we're like Jack and Jill
K, you're so kissable
L is the love light in your eyes
M, N, O, P, I could go on all day
Q, R, S, T, alphabetically speaking, you're okay
U made my life complete
V means you're very sweet
W, X, Y, Z
It's fun to wander through the alphabet with you
To tell you what you mean to me
(Just then Cookie Monster marches up, demanding--)
Cookie Monster: Where's my blocks?!
Adrian: EEEEEEKKK!!!!!!
(She runs off, leaving Guy looking very embarassed. As he begins the second half, he starts hurriedly picking up blocks. Each time, Cookie Monster grabs it away and eats it in that ab-ab way of his.)
Guy: (speaks, the tune still playing) Well, here's A ... and B ... C ... D ... and E ... and F ... Gee! ... H ...
Cookie Monster: I! Where's I?
Guy: Here's I! ... and J ... and K ... and here's L .... M, N, O, P, I could go on all day--

Guy: (hurriedly now) Q, R, S, T,--alphabetically speaking, you're okay--U! V! W X Y Z! It's fun to wander through! The alphabet with you! And tell you what you mean to me! (Runs off)
Cookie Monster: (just before he eats the last block) Bye bye!

It's all right to cry
Crying gets the sad out of you
It's all right to cry
It might make you feel better
Raindrops from your eyes
Washing all the mad out of you
Raindrops from your eyes
It's gonna make you feel better
It's all right to feel things
Though the feelings may feel strange
Feelings are such real things
And they change and change and change
Sad and grumpy
Down-in-the dumpy
Snuggly, huggly
Mean and ugly
Sloppy, slappy
Hoppy, happy!
Change and change and change
It's all right to feel things
Though the feelings may feel strange
Feelings are such real things
And they change and change and change
It's all right to know
Feelings come and feelings go
It's all right to cry
It might make you feel better
Spoken: It's all right to cry, little boy
I know some big boys that cry too
If you wake up in the morning mean and grumpy
And you frown at ev'rybody that you see
If you like your oatmeal nice and cold and lumpy
Then you're a grouch like me
If you love it when it's wet and cold and raining
And the music that you like is all off key
If you're happiest whenever you're complaining
Then you're a grouch like me
If you hate it when your grandma kisses you
You know what? Well me, too!
If you love to see a garbage truck roll by
You know what? So do I!
And if you think a great big pile of trash is pretty
And that ice cream is yucchy as can be
If you can't stand a cuddly little kitty, then you're a grouch like me
If you hate it when your grandma kisses you
You know what? Well me, too!
If you love to see a garbage truck roll by
You know what? So do I!
And if you think a great big pile of trash is pretty
And that ice cream is yucchy as can be
If you can't stand a cuddly little kitty
And you'd like to chase her up the nearest tree
Then you can be pretty sure that you're a grouch like me

Ssssssssssss! Yeah, that's fine.
That's the sound you hear in the beginning of a word like "sing" or "storytime."
Let's do it again. Ssssssssssss!
Yeah, you hear that sound in the beginning of a word like "seesaw," "silly," "super," "star," or "seven."
(sung)
Yeah, I'm Sammy the snake,
And I have to confess
That I look and I sound just like the letter "S".
(spoken)
Ssssssssssss! So long.
Take a breath
Take a breath
Smell a smell
Sniff a sniff
And take a breath
You can move your feet to walk
And you use your tongue to talk
But your mouth and nose are waiting
Take a breath
Take a breath
Take a breath
Smell a smell
Sniff a sniff
And take a breath
You can move your teeth to chew
But your face is turning blue
Get some air inside of you
Just take a breath
You never think of breathing
Though you do it all day long
You even have to breathe
To sing this funny little song

You've got to take a breath
Before you try to blow a bubble
And if you stop your breathing
You've got big big trouble!
So take a good deep breath
(breathing sound)
That's better
Take a breath
Take a breath
Smell a smell
Sniff a sniff
And take a breath
There are many ways to play
But you're growing every day
And you need some ventilation
Take a breath
You've got to do your breathing
Take a breath
(breathing sound)
Take a breath!

(Telly stands up with the bricks, starts to lean over and they both fall down.)

Every time I feel alone
And slightly blue
That's when I begin to think
It's what I'd like to start to do
And though it may not be the kind of thing
That's quite your cup of tea
I recommend you pay attention
To the little dance you're gonna see
Doin' the (coo, coo) pigeon
Doin' the (coo, coo) pigeon
Dancing a little smidgeon of
The kind of ballet
Sweeps me away
Doin' the (coo, coo) pigeon
Doin' the (coo, coo) pigeon

People may smile but
I don't mind
They'll never understand
The kind of fun I find
Doin' the (coo, coo) pigeon
Doin' the (coo, coo) pigeon
Doin' the (coo, coo) pigeon everyday
People may smile, but
I don't mind!
They'll never understand
The kind of fun I find
Doin' the (coo, coo) pigeon

Doin' the (coo, coo) pigeon everyday
Big Bird: I'm a bluebird that's been dreaming
Of a rainbow I can follow
To that old familiar place I long to see
Friendly faces, a smile to greet me
Or just a simple "Hello, how are you?"
Oh, without them, I'm so blue
There's only one thing that will do
To make this heartache end
To be back home again
(sighs)
Boy in audience (Liston Bates, spoken): He sure looks sad.
Girl sitting next to boy (Tawny Richard, spoken): He sure does.
Big Bird: I'll never lose my dreams
Even though this time it seems
Like I'm such a long way
From any rainbows that might keep my dreams from fading
Oh, no wonder I'm so blue
(Sam, working spotlight, cries loudly)
Big Bird: There's only one thing that will do
To make this heartache end
To be back home again
To be back home again
Sid (counting money backstage while he sings):
I'm a rich man, getting richer
Here's my money; let me count it
I'm so happy... (starts whistling)
(Boy and girl from audience sneak in behind him and go to sleeping Big Bird's cage.)
Girl: Are you real?
(A tear trickles from Big Bird's left eye)
Boy: He must be real; he's crying. (to Big Bird) What's the matter?
Big Bird (wakes up and sees kids): Oh, oh, uh, I'm in big trouble, see? Uh, could you do me a favor? (Kids nod) Uh, I, I can't get out of here, and I want to! So, could you call Mister Looper's Store on Sesame Street and tell somebody where I am?
Sid (spoken, noticing kids): Hey, kids, get away from the talent! Go on, get! Scram! (barks like a dog as kids run off. Laughs.)
(singing) I'm a rich man, getting richer!
(Girl is on pay phone with boy lifting her. Phone rings once, and operator answers.)
Operator (spoken): Operator. May I help you?
Girl (spoken): Hello, operator, can you tell me how to get to Sesame Street?
Everybody sleeps
Everybody sleeps
Every night we close our eyes
Until the morning creeps
Mountaineers on mountain tops
And divers in the deeps
They like to sleep
How do we know it's so
'Cause everybody, everybody sleeps
There are people who sleep lightly
There are people who sleep sound
There are folks who tuck themselves in bed
And some sleep on the ground
There are people who sleep nightly
There are people who sleep days
But it really doesn't matter
Don't you know, it's so
'Cause you can sleep in oh so many ways
Everybody sleeps
Everybody sleeps
Every night we close our eyes
Until the morning creeps
Mountaineers on mountain tops
And divers in the deeps
They like to sleep
How do we know it's so
'Cause everybody, everybody sleeps
Everybody sleeps
Ernie: Hey, Bert!
Come fly with me in an upside-down world!
(Bert: Whaaa!)
There's so many strange things to see! (laugh)
There's upside-down people who walk down the street
With upside-down shoes on their upside-down feet
In an upside-down world
(Bert: Ernie!!)
In an upside-down world
(Bert: Ernie, I don't feel so good)
Ernie: Whee!
It's fun to be in an upside-down world
There's fish that fall out of the sea
(Bert: Uh oh!)
There's upside-down clocks that make everyone late!
(Bert: Aaah!)
Upside-down food that won't stay on your plate
In an upside-down world (laugh)
In an upside-down world!
There's upside down everything all over town
It all looks so funny that I've got to frown
'Cause a frown is a smile when it's turned upside-down
In an upside-down
(Bert: What side down?)
Ernie: Upside-down world.
Spoken:
Ernie: Hey, Bert, how'd you like to take over the controls?
Bert: No! No! Never in a million years!
Ernie: Yeah, Bert, it's really easy!
Bert: No! No!
Ernie: Hey, Bert, I'm going to trade places with you!
Bert: What?? What, no, Ernie!
*sound of airplane listing to one side badly*
Bert: *laugh* Hey, Ernie, this is fun! *laugh*
Ernie: We don't have time for fun now, Bert! We've gotta find Big Bird!
Bert: Oh!
Sung:
Ernie: There's upside-down everything all over town
It all looks so funny, that I've got to frown
'Cause a frown! Is a smile! When it's turned upside-down!
In an upside down, what side down?, whoops side down, oops side down, what side down, upside down woooooorld!!!!!
Spoken:
Ernie: Oh no, I think you've lost him, Bert!
Bert: I'VE lost him???
Ernie: Yeah, while you were singing, Bert!
Bert: But ... you were singing too, you always do this to me!
Ernie: Why don't you just turn the plane around?
Bert: You, you, you drive it!!
Ernie: Would you just turn the plane around?
*fading voices*
The earth's a Big Blue Marble
When you see it from out there
The sun and moon declare
Our beauty's very rare
Folks are folks and kids are kids
We share a common name
We speak a different way
But work and play the same
We sing pretty much alike
Enjoy spring pretty much alike
Peace and love we all understand
And laughter, we use the very same brand
Our differences, our problems
From out there there's not much trace
Our friendships they can place
While looking at the face
Of the Big Blue Marble in space
Oh, the number one is not my favorite number (why?)
'Cause one means only me and there's no you (aw, Ernie)
But one plus one you see
Makes two, that's you and me
And it's more fun when one and one make two
Oh, one and one make two
At least I'm pretty sure they do
Oh yes it's true
One and one make two
Now, say you want to play upon a seesaw
You're all alone and don't know what to do (well, what would I do, Ernie?)
Well, just go and find a friend
And he'll sit on the other end
You'll have more fun when one and one make two
Oh, one and one make two
At least I'm pretty sure they do
Oh yes it's true
One and one make two
Now, everyone needs somebody to share with
A pal to help and care for through and through
And there's no one that I've known
Who can do those things alone
It's a lot nicer when one and one make two
Oh, one and one make two
At least I'm pretty sure they do
Oh yes it's true
One and one make two
(Let's sing harmony!)
One and one make two
At least I'm pretty sure they do
Oh yes it's true
One and one make two
I said, it's true
One and one make two
They certainly do
One and one make two-oo-ooh!
Skin!
Covered all over with beautiful skin
Skin!
Covered all over from ankle to chin
Lovely skin on kneeses and noses and ev'rywhere
Skin on tummies and toeses and under your hair it's even there
Oh skin!
Wonderful colors and beautiful tones
Skin!
Think of without it you're nothing but bones
Skin is ever so lovely no matter the color you're in
Let's hear it for skin
Beautiful skin
Skin!
Covered all over with beautiful skin
Skin!
Covered all over from ankle to chin
Without skin for touching and rubbing how much we'd miss
There'd be no hands for shaking and scrubbing
And just think of this no cheeks to kiss
Oh skin!
Wonderful colors and beautiful tones
Skin!
Keeping the rain off our muscles and bones
Skin is ever so lovely no matter the color you're in
Let's hear it for skin
Beautiful skin

If just one person believes in you,
Deep enough, and strong enough, believes in you...
Hard enough, and long enough,
It stands to reason, that someone else will think
"If he can do it, I can do it."
Making it: two whole people, who believe in you
Deep enough, and strong enough,
Believe in you.
Hard enough and long enough
There's bound to be some other person who
Believes in making it a threesome,
Making it three...
People you can say: believe in me...
And if three whole people,
Why not -- four?
And if four whole people,

Why not--more, and
more, and
more...
And when all those people,
Believe in you,
Deep enough, and strong enough,
Believe in you...
Hard enough, and long enough
It stands to reason that you yourself will
Start to see what everybody sees in
You...
And maybe even you,
Can believe in you... too!

Who dance with their fiddlers three
Or you can read about kids
Just like you and me
Yes, in the library

Books of every shape and kind

Of a creature called a gnu

One, two, two little dolls
One, two, two little chairs
Two little dolls, two little chairs, two little girls
And a little dollhouse
One, two, two little plates
One, two, two little spoons
Two little plates, two little spoons, two little dolls
And a little dollhouse
Two little girls serve two dolls tea
Behaving grown-up as can be.
They have two cups--one and two
I can count them--why don't you?
One, two, two sleepy heads
One, two, two little beds
Two sleepy heads, two little beds, all quiet now
In a little dollhouse
What's that? Small pitter-pats
One, two, two kitty cats
Two kitty cats went on a spree
Then sat down and had some tea.
I cry in the morning
I cry at night
I cry-cry-cry when I get uptight
I cry for my bottle
I cry for my doll
I cry-eye-eye til they hear me call
Oh my
How I can cry
I wish I could speak, but I gotta shriek
If I wanna stay warm and fed and dry, I cry
WAHHHHHH!
I cry for my blanket
I cry for fun
I cry-cry-cry when I'm all undone
I cry for my rattle
I cry for my snake
I cry 'til it's more than you can take
Oh my!
How I can cry
I wish I could talk, but I gotta squawk
If I wanna stay warm, and fed and dry, I cry
Wahhhhhh!
I cry when I need some sympathy
I cry 'cause it always works for me
I cry when I need a little help
I cry and scream and push and yelp and cry
Wahhhhh!
I cry for attention
I cry for food
I cry when I'm coming all unglued
I cry for a cookie
I cry for some juice
I cry 'cause I feel like cuttin' loose
Oh my
How I can cry
I wish I could speak, but I gotta shriek
If I wanna stay warm and fed and dry, I cry
Wahhhhhh!!!!
In a cabin in the woods
A monster by the window stood
Saw a rabbit hopping by
Knockin' at the door
"Help me, help me, sir," he said,
"I ate the farmer's lettuce bed."
"Come on in," the monster cried,
"And sit down by the fire."
In a cabin in the woods
A monster by the window stood
Saw a farmer running by
Knockin' at the door
"My name" he said "is Farmer Lear
You've seen a rabbit go by here?"
(they interrupt the song, Rowlf suggests to have a happy ending, and they all live happily ever after. The end.)
Sometime me think,
What is friend?
And me think,
Friend something very special.
A friend somebody to share your toys,
To stay with and to play with and to make a lot of noise,
To spin around until friend get dizzy,
And jump up and down until stomach get queasy,
And to sometimes tell stories to.
A friend somebody like you.
Sometimes me think,
What is friend?
And me think,
Friend something better than chocolate ice cream!
A friend somebody to take to park,
A buddy you can buddy with 'til it start getting dark,
To laugh and joke and hippity-hop it,
Or tickle and poke 'til friend tell you to stop it,
And me no think of any more.
Well maybe friend somebody
You give up last cookie for.

Now I've said my ABC's
Won't you sing along with me
Spoken: Oh, me love to look at sky at night, to see stars go twinkle-twinkle.
But, you know what me love to look at most - the moon.
It's so big and round. And you know what moon remind me of?
It remind me of big delicious cookie!
Imagine, imagine what me do if moon was cookie.
Imagine.
Sung:
If moon was cookie, me think me would be
The happiest monster you've ever seen
I'd put on a spacesuit and up through the night
I'd ride in a rocket and go take a bite
Me take bite from here, me take bite from there
And pretty soon me bite everywhere
Me eat with both hands, don't need fork or spoon

I'd chew it all up, until there's no moon
Spoken:
Who turned out the lights? Oh, me know what happened.
Me ate moon and now there's no moonlight.
Sung:
If moon was Cookie it wouldn't be fine
'Cause if me ate it, then it wouldn't shine
Me come to the window and look up at night
But no little moonbeams would give me the light
So me not like to say it, but it clear to me
We're lucky that moon is not a cookie

Bert: (spoken)
Oh boy. Oh boy. It's one o'clock.
The little hand's on the one, and the big hand's on the twelve.
You know what I say to myself every day at one o'clock?
I say to myself, Bert, it's one o'clock now - time for one of the most exciting things I do everyday.
It's time for my nap.
Sung:
Oh, it's time for a nap now
Time for resting my head
Yes, it's time for a nap now
Nice and comfy in bed
Feel my eyes getting drowsy
Time for counting some sheep
It's such a perfect time to get some sleep
Ernie: Hi there, Bert. Hey, I've got a great idea for what we can do now, Bert.
Bert: Please don't bother me now, Ernie
Ernie: How would you like to play some ball, Bert?
Wouldn't you like to go outside?
Wouldn't you like to play a game of hide and seek?
You seek, I'll hide
(No thanks, Ernie)
Maybe a run around the block, Bert
Really, it's such a lovely day
And such a perfect time for us to go out and play
Come on, are you ready?
Bert: I'd really rather not
Ernie: Well, why not, Bert?
(They sing their parts overlapping)
You sure you don't want to come outside?
I'm sleepy
Okay, byebye
Goodnight
Mom: (in doorway, to Gerald, who is in bed) Goodnight, dear.
Dad: (in doorway, too, to Gerald) Goodnight, Gerald. (and to the dog, on the floor beside the bed) Goodnight, Sparky.
Mom: (to Sparky) Goodnight, Sparky.
Gerald: Goodnight, Mom. Goodnight, Dad. Goodnight, Sparky.
(Door closes and lights go out. Sparky jumps up and runs to the foot of the bed where he makes a huge shadow of an alligator on the wall)
Sparky: (singing) Imagine me an alligator! (chorus in background sings "Alligator!")
Gerald: MOM! There's an alligator in my room!
Mom: (coming in; Sparky dashes back beside the bed) I don't see an alligator.
Gerald: Sure, it's not there now, but when you turn out the light, it's there!
Mom: Go to sleep, Gerald. It's just your imagination.
(Door closes and lights go out. Up jumps Sparky.)
Sparky: (singing) Sweet potato! (chorus: "Alligator!") I was lookin' --
Gerald: MOM!!!!!
Mom & Dad: (opening door; Sparky of course returns to spot) What is it?!
Gerald: The alligator! It's back!
Mom: (leaving) Go to sleep, Gerald.
(Sparky resumes his song)
Sparky: (singing) And you came by for me to munch ya!
I'm afraid of gettin' thinner
Won't you please become my dinner --
Gerald: (peeking over the end of the bed) Sparky!!! It was you all the time!
(Sparky blushes and goes to sleep)
Mom: (from hallway) What is that singing?
Gerald: Oh, nothing, Mom. Just your imagination. (grins)
Bert: "Look at this mess! Ernie, don't you think it's time to put all these toys away?"
Ernie: (looks up from the fire engine) "Well yes, but I didn't get all the toys out."
Bert: "Yes, but you got most of the toys out."
Ernie: "Wellllll, how about I put most of the toys away?"
Bert: "Fine. You put most of the toys away, and I'll pick up the rest." (leaves)
Ernie: "Okay .... Let's see, how about I put away all the fire engines?
(picks up the engine and starts to leave, stops)
But there's still a lot of toys left. How about I put away all the big toys? Is this a big toy? This? This?

Bert: "Ernie--ERNIE! I thought you told me you were going to put most of the toys away!"
Ernie: "I am, Bert. I'm putting away all the fire engines,--"
Bert: "Yeah?"
Ernie: "--all the big toys,--"
Bert: "Yeah?"
Ernie: "--all the red toys,--"
Bert: "Ye--" (he suddenly realizes)
Ernie: "--all the toys with wheels, and all the toys with ladders. Yessir, I'm really putting away the toys."
(Ernie marches off, leaving Bert groaning amidst the huge pile of toys still left.)

(Repeat ad nauseum)
I've a special secret children ought to know;
It's about the little mistakes you make as you begin to grow.
If you make a mistake, you shouldn't start to cry.
Mistakes are not so bad, and here is why:
Oh everyone makes mistakes.
Oh, yes they do
Your sister and your brother and your dad and mother too;
Big people, small people, matter of fact, all people!
Everyone makes mistakes, so why can't you?
If you make a mistake while counting to ten,
Well don't get mad and don't be sad;
Just start to count again.
And if you should only get to eight or nine,
I'm still your friend and I still like you fine,
'Cause everyone makes mistakes.
Oh, yes they do
Your sister and your brother and your dad and mother too;
Big people, small people, matter of fact, all people!
Everyone makes mistakes, so why can't you?
If you spill a glass of milk all over the floor,
Well, your mom and dad still like you just as much as they did before,
'Cause when Mother and Dad were just as small as you,
I'll bet that they knocked their milk over too.
'Cause everyone makes mistakes.
Oh, yes they do
Your sister and your brother and your dad and mother too;
Big people, small people, matter of fact, all people!
Everyone makes mistakes, so why can't you?
If everyone in the whole wide world makes mistakes,
Then why can't you?
Ernie: I've got two eyes
Elmo: Oh, got two eyes

Elmo: Yes, got a mouth
Ernie: So I can speak
Elmo: A mouth can speak
Ernie: I've got a cheek right here
And here I've got another cheek
Elmo: Another cheek
Ernie: I've got a nose
Elmo: One little nose
Ernie: So I can smell
Elmo: A nose can smell
Ernie: I've got a chin
But what a chin does I just can't tell
Elmo: Just can not tell
Ernie: I've got eyes, ears, nose, mouth, cheek, and chin
Each in its place
And they're all part of one fine face
Ernie: You've got two eyes

Elmo: Two pretty eyes
Ernie: So you can see
Elmo: Just look and see
Ernie: You've got two ears to listen to what you say to me
Elmo: What you say to me
Ernie: You've got a mouth
Elmo: Oh yes, a mouth
Ernie: So you can speak
Elmo: A mouth can speak
Ernie: You've got a cheek right here
And here you've got another cheek

Ernie: You've got a nose
Elmo: A little nose
Ernie: So you can smell

But what a chin does you just can't tell
Elmo: Just can not tell
Ernie: You've got eyes, ears, nose, mouth, cheek, and chin
Elmo: Each in its place
Both: And they're all part of one fine face
Yes, they're all part of one fine face
Which come first, the chicken or the aig?
Which come first, the chicken or the aig?
How could somethin' so fat and burly
Come from somethin' so smooth and pearly?
Which come first, the chicken or the aig?
Which come first, the feather or the shell?
Which come first, the feather or the shell?
When you see one egg or t'other,
Do you ever think about its mother?
Which come first, the feather or the shell?
Now eggs are all so purty, lyin' on a plate,
Or sittin' here in a carton, neat and straight.
And lookin' inside a box of eggs might make you feel so great,
But do you ever wonder where they was, before they was inside that crate?
Which come first, the chicken or the aig?
Which come first, the chicken or the aig?
Now if you wanted to begin again,
Would you start with an omelette or a hen?
Which come first, the chicken or the aig?
The chicken or the aig?

Proud To Be A Cow
Sometimes when I'm in a mood
I think of animals I might have been
I could have been a wombat or a goose
I could have been a monkey or a moose
I could have been a dragon
Or a horse that pulls a wagon but I'm not sure what
Let others be a lion or a lamb
I'm proud to be the creature that I am
I'm proud proud proud to be a cow
I'm proud proud proud to be a cow
My skin is soft as silk
I give a lot of milk
I never pull a wagon or a plow
I'm proud proud proud to be a cow
I'm glad that I say moo and not meow
My eyes are soft and dreamy
My butter's rich and creamy
I'm proud proud proud to be a cow
I could have been a butterfly they're pretty
I could have been a cockroach in the city
I could have been an. I know!
I could have been a rhino
But I'm not
So what?
I'm proud proud proud to be a cow
I'm proud proud proud to be a cow
I've horns upon my head
A meadow is my bed
I think that ev'ry cow should take a bow
I'm proud proud proud to be a cow
I'm glad that I say moo and not bow-wow
I'm proud I have an udder like my father, no, my mudder
I'm proud proud proud to be a cow
I'm proud proud proud to be a cow
This frog has to go his own way
This frog doesn't care what the other frogs say
This frog wants to be happy, and this frog has to try
This frog is gonna make it or know the reason why
I'm not gonna sit here like some dumb old bump on a log
That isn't me!
I'm gonna be this frog!
This frog has a song to be sung
This frog isn't gonna spend his life in a swamp, catchin flies with his tongue
This frog may slip and stumble, but this frog tries again
This frog never will grumble, but fall to rise again
This frog is staying with it, like a tick sticks to a dog
I'm gonna win!
You're gonna love this frog!
(This winning frog....)
This frog has some climbing to do
This frog has some dreams that he's makin come true
This frog never will falter, no not through slush or fog
This frog will not wear a halter, cause nothing halts this frog!
I made myself a promise as a young green pollywog:
I'll be on top!
Nothing can stop (Nothing can stop) THIS FROG!

Let me take you to the
Alphabet jungle
Follow me from A to Z
Little girl: A is swinging like an ape
B gives a big bad roar
C is swimming by a crocodile
Wait, there's a whole lot more!
D takes a dive
E's getting splashed
By an elephant and his trunk
F and G stepped into quicksand
Now they're really sunk!
H is hungry as a hippo
I is swatting flies
J and K are playing jumping jacks
Underneath the jungle skies
L is lounging by the river
M's melting from the heat
The letter N comes out at night
And dances to the jungle beat
O is riding on an ostrich
P leads a parrot parade
Q got crushed by a rhinoceros
And R is running away
The letter S is really scared
Because of what it sees:
A t-t-t-t-t-tarantula
Is crawling 'cross the T's!
The letter U's unusual
It likes to hang around
V points the way to the waterfall
Where the W's are sliding down
X marks the spot where a treasure chest
Of Y's lies patiently
And right behind that zebra
Is a snoring letter Z

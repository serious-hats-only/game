Oooooooh, New York!
Oooooooh, New York! Grew up in a town that was famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud, there are sirens all around and the streets are mean
If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere that's what they say
Seeing my face in lights or my name in marquees found down on Broadway Even if it ain't all it seems
I got a pocketful of dreams aby I'm from New York!
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do, now you're in New York!
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New Yooork!
On the avenue there ain't never a curfew ladies work so hard Such a melting pot on the corner selling rock preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger far more than an empty fridge
I'ma make it by any means, I got a pocketful of dreams baby I'm from New York! Concrete jungle where dreams are made of

Grew up in a town that is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud, there are sirens all around and the streets are mean
If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, that's what they say
Seeing my face in lights or my name on marquees found down on Broadway
Even if it ain't all it seems, I got a pocket full of dreams
Baby, I'm from New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it from New York, New York, New York!
On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew, ladies work so hard
Such a melting pot, on the corner selling rock, preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy-cab, takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Some will sleep tonight with a hunger far more than an empty fridge
I'm gonna make it by any means, I got a pocket full of dreams
Baby, I'm from New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it from New York, New York, New York!
One hand in the air for the big city,
Street lights, big dreams all looking pretty
No place in the world that can compare
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
In New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you

Had to grab my heart back
God knows something had to change
I thought that you'd be happy
I found the one thing I need
Why you mad?
It's just a brand new kinda me
It took a long, long time to get here
It took a brave, brave girl to try
It took one too many excuses, one too many lies
Don't be surprised, don't be surprised If I talk a little louder If I speak up when you're wrong
If I walk a little taller
I've been under you too long
If you notice that I'm different
Don't take it personally
Don't be mad
It's just a brand new kinda me
That ain't bad
I found a brand new kinda free
Ooh, it took a long, long road to get here
It took a brave, brave girl to try I've taken one too many excuses, one too many lies
Don't be surprised, oh, said, you look surprised Hey, if you were a friend
You'd wanna get to know me again
If you were worth the while
You'd be happy to see me smile
I'm not expecting sorry I'm too busy finding myself

I don't really care
What nobody tells me
I'm gonna be here
It's a matter of extreme importance
My first teenage love affair
Eh eh eh eh, eh eh, eh aay He broke my heart
And now it's raining
Just don't rub it in
I'm at your door
I feel so crazy 'bout it You say "I told you so"
You saw it long ago
You knew he had to go
I finally came around
I'm back on solid ground
Can't let it get me down It's alright
It's alright
It's alright (It's alright)
It's alright (Yeah)
It's alright (Yeah)
It's alright Yes, I was burned but I call it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned so call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned so I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned Sometimes, some lies can take a minute to fully realize
His tears, your eyes, thirty seconds to apologize
You give it one more chance, just like the time before
But he already know, you'd give a hundred more
Until that night in bed, you wake up in a sweat
You're racing to the door, can't take it anymore I was burned but I call it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned so call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned so I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned Life perfect ain't perfect
If you don't know what the struggle's for
Falling down ain't falling down
If you don't cry when you hit the floor
It's called the past 'cause I'm getting past
And I ain't nothing like I was before
You ought to see me now Yes, I was burned but I call it a lesson learned
Mistake overturned so call it a lesson learned
My soul has returned so I call it a lesson learned
Another lesson learned Said yes, I was burned but I call it a lesson learned
(It's alright, it's alright)
Said mistake overturned so call it a lesson learned
(It's alright, it's alright)
My soul has returned so I call it a lesson learned
(It's alright, it's alright)
Another lesson learned It's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around... Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around... Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive
That would be enough And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile
Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
That would be enough I don't pretend to know
The challenges you're facing
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind But I'm not afraid
I know who I married
So long as you come home at the end of the day
That would be enough We don't need a legacy
We don't need money
If I could grant you peace of mind
If you could let me inside your heart... Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
In the story they will write someday
Let this moment be the first chapter:
Where you decide to stay And I would be enough
And this could be enough
This would be enough Said, I would be enough
And this could be enough
See, we could be enough
Oh baby I could be enough
We could be enough
This could be enough
Oooh Don't look no further
Don't go nowhere
I could be enough (I could be enough)
We could have it all Tell me baby (baby)
Can you feel me? (ayy)
Can I be enough?
(Can I be enough?)
And your family?
(Me and your family?)
Listen, baby (Listen, baby)
We can have it all
(We could have it all)
Can I be enough?
(Can I be enough?)
Yeah
Woo So look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around... Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around...
Baby
Darling
Oooh And everybody know the story of David and Goliath
But this is bigger than triumph
This is for the warrior, this is for you and I
This is for euphoria, give me a piece of mind
God is recording this! won't you look in the sky?
Tell him that you got the behavior of your neighbor
Even when stability's never in your favor
Fly with the turbulence, only last a minute
Land on your dreams, and recognize you live it
Walk through the valley of peace, with bare feet
Run through the flames, that's more passion for me
I passed testimony just so the world can see
Battle wounds on me, now watch me like em clean
I know, I know, my pride, my goals, my highs
My lows, I know I know, it's mind control
I know I could prosper, no impostor
Prosecute my posture
I stand up and I stand by it what I am a freedom fighter, the name that history wrote
And even through disaster, eye of the tiger for hope
I'm trying to find my way back, there's no day off for heroes
And even when I'm tired, " Go" is the only word I know And the night is takin' over
And the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen
And it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken
By the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you move forward
I bet they wonder how I go on
I bet they wonder how I go on I'll simply say it's on again, it's on again
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again I am a lonely hero, trying to fight my battles
Life likes to blow the cold wind, sometimes it freezes my shadow
In the midst of all this darkness, I sacrifice my ego
There ain't no room for selfish, we do it for the people And the night is takin' over
And the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen
And it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken
By the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you move forward
I bet they wonder how I go on
I bet they wonder how I go on I'll simply say it's on again, it's on again
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again The work don't stop, 'cause they don't stop
And everybody here trying to get on top
Everybody from the burbs down to the block
Gotta hold on tight and don't let go, let go
Nah
So you think you're hot?
Gotta grind hard, give it all you got
You can have, or you can have not
You see that a lot in the ghetto (ghetto)
How I go on, go on
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on I'll simply say it's on again, it's on again
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again This song is dedicated
to all the lovers who cant be together
separated by distance and time You were always on my mind
All I do is count the days Where are you now?
Know I never let you down
I will never go away I really wish that you would stay but what would we do
All the days that you've been gone I dream about you
And I anticipate the day that you will come home, home, home
No matter how far you are No matter how long it takes him
Through distance and time
I'll be waiting And if you have to walk a million miles
I'll wait a million days to see you smile
Distance and time, I'll be waiting
Distance and time, I'll be waiting
Will you take a train, to meet me where I am Are you on your way?
And I will never do anything to hurt you
I'll never live without you I really wish that you would stay but what would we do
All the days that you've been gone I dreamed about you
And I anticipate the day that you will come home, home, home
No matter how far you are
No matter how long it takes him
Distance and time, I'll be waiting
And if you have to walk a million miles I'll wait a million days to see you smile
Distance and time
I'll be waiting
No matter how far you are
No matter how long it takes him
Through distance and time, I'll be waiting And you can walk a million miles
I'll wait a million days to see you smile
Through distance and time, I'll be waiting Oh oh oh, oh
Oh oh oh, hey
Oh oh oh oh
I'll be waiting
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Through distance and time
I'll be waiting
You are always on my mind
All I do is count the days
Where are you now? If war is holy and sex is obscene
Then we got it twisted in this lucid dream
Baptized in boundaries, schooled in sin
Divided by difference, sexuality and skin So we can hate each other and fear each other
We can build these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself locked in, yourself locked in
We can hate each other and fear each other
We can build these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself locked in, yourself locked Maybe we should love somebody
Maybe we could care a little more
Maybe we should love somebody
Instead of polishing the bombs of holy war What if sex was holy and war was obscene
And it wasn't twisted, what a wonderful dream
Living for love, unafraid of the end
Forgiveness is the only real revenge So we can heal each other and fill each other
We can break these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself open, yourself open
We can heal each other and fill each other
We can break these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself open, you open Maybe we should love somebody
Maybe we could care a little more
Maybe we should love somebody
Instead of polishing the bombs of holy war What if love was holy and hate obscene
We should give life to this beautiful dream
Cause peace and love ain't so far
If we nurse our wounds before they scar
Nurse our wounds before they scar Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before but that life's a bore
So full of the superficial Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love him Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be?
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, you, you Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah If I ain't got you with me, baby
Said nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me, baby But all I wanna know baby is,
if what we had was good
I, yea baby I keep your picture beside my bed
And I still remember everything you said
I always thought our love was so right
I guess I was wrong
Always thought you'd be by my side, papa
Now you're gone And I'm not tryina hear that shit What I wanna know baby
If what we had was good
How come you don't call me
Anymore? Still like a fire on a rainy night
(You ain't think that did you?)
Still like it better when you're holding me tight
(You know, yea)
Everybody said
Everybody said that we should never part
Tell me baby, baby, baby why
Why you wanna go and break my heart? All I wanna know is baby
If what we had was good
How come you don't call me
Anymore? Sometimes it feels like I'm gonna die
If you don't call me papa
Ooh, you got to try
Won't get down on my knees
Won't beg you please
Please, ooh Won't you call me sometime, papa?
Why don't you call me back no more? Why on earth can't you just pick up the phone?
You know I don't like to be alone How come you don't call me?
(Why must you torture me?)
How come you don't call me?

To clear his mind.
Meanwhile I'm losing mine We're at the crossroads my dear
Where do we go from here?
Maybe you won't go, maybe you'll stay
Oh I know I'm gonna miss you either way
Its such a lonely road Where do we go from here?
All I can do is follow the tracks of my tears Oh! When I cry your name am I calling in vain?
Or am I waiting only to drown in pain?
Oh! Don't you do it, no, said don't you leave me this way
I don't know if I can lift my head and face another day
Ooh, its such a lonely road Where do we go from here?
All I can do is follow the tracks of my tears Usually not the kind of girl who's lost and looking for direction
Who could this be staring at me?
When I'm looking in the mirror try'na find a resolution
Are we too far gone to find our way home? Where do we go from here?
All I can do is follow the tracks of my tears, oh
Where do we go from here?
(Maybe you wont go, maybe you'll stay)
All I can do is follow the tracks of my tears
(Follow either way) But all I wanna know baby is,
if what we had was good
I, yea baby I keep your picture beside my bed
And I still remember everything you said
I always thought our love was so right
I guess I was wrong
Always thought you'd be by my side, papa
Now you're gone And I'm not tryina hear that shit What I wanna know baby
If what we had was good
How come you don't call me
Anymore? Still like a fire on a rainy night
(You ain't think that did you?)
Still like it better when you're holding me tight
(You know, yea)
Everybody said
Everybody said that we should never part
Tell me baby, baby, baby why
Why you wanna go and break my heart? All I wanna know is baby
If what we had was good
How come you don't call me
Anymore? Sometimes it feels like I'm gonna die
If you don't call me papa
Ooh, you got to try
Won't get down on my knees
Won't beg you please
Please, ooh Won't you call me sometime, papa?
Why don't you call me back no more? Why on earth can't you just pick up the phone?
You know I don't like to be alone How come you don't call me?
(Why must you torture me?)
How come you don't call me?
(repeat chorus until faded) Moment of honesty,
Someones gotta take the lead tonight
Whose it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here and tell u while it comes to me
If u have something to say
You should say it right now
(You should say it right now) You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
Its become something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable will it make us look crazy
If you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready) I know u said to me
This is exactly how it should feel when its meant to be
Time is only wasting so why wait for eventually
If we gonna do something about it
We should do it right now
(We should do it right now) You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
Its become something that's impossible to ignore
Its what we make it I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable
Will it make us look crazy
Or would it be so beautiful
Either way I'm sayin
If you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready) Sayin
I give up before we try
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away (fly away)
I can't say I can't compare
I'm suspended it the air
Won't u come be in the sky with me I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable
Will it make us look crazy
Or would it be so beautiful
Either way I'm sayin
If you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready) Mmm, mmm
Right now I feel like a bird
Caged without a key
Everyone comes to stare at me
With so much joy and revelry
They don't know how I feel inside
Through my smile I cry
They don't know what they're doin' to me
Keepin' me from flyin' That's why I say that I know
Why the caged bird sings
Only joy comes from song
She's so rare and beautiful to others
Why not just set her free?
So she can fly, fly, fly
Spreadin' her wings and her song
Let her fly, fly, fly
For the whole world to see Mmm, mmm
Hey, hey
Mmm, mmm
She's like a caged bird
Fly, fly
Ooh, just let her fly
Just let her fly, just let her fly
Spread wings, spread beauty
Hmm I know the player
With the slick
Trigger finger
For Her Majesty
Another one
With the
Golden tone voice
And then your fantasy
Another bill
From a killer
Turned a thrill
Into a tragedy A door left open
A woman walking by
A drop in the water
A look in the eye
A phone on the table
A man on your side
Someone that you think
That you can trust is just Another tricky little gun Giving solace to the one
That will never see
The sunshine
Another inch of your life
Sacrificed
For your brother
In the nick of time
Another dirty money
Heaven sent honey Turning on a dime
A door left open A woman walking by
A drop in the water
A look in the eye
A phone on the table
A man on your side
Someone that you think That you can
Trust is just
Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oah! Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!
Another girl With her finger
On the world singing?
Another gun thrown down
And surrendered
Took away your fear
Hey! Another man
That stands right
Behind you
Looking in the mirror
Oh, a door left open A woman walking by
A drop in the water
A look in the eye
A phone on the table
A man on your side
Oh
Someone that you think
That you can trust
Is just another way to die Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before but that life's a bore
So full of the superficial Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love him Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be?
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, you, you Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah If I ain't got you with me, baby
Said nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me, baby [Hook:]

There's no other way
That I would want someone to hold me, show me like you
Falling in a daze
So many ways, I'm in amazement
Thinking about you
No one took the time
To hold my mind, and be the kind
That I could talk to
This is the type of day
That I must say, I've been looking forward to
Look at me shedding no tears
No worries followed by fear
So good that soon you'll be here
They just don't know how good it feels [Chorus:]
Feels so good to not be searching
Searching just to find that someone
Feels so good to not be searching
Knowing that I found that right one

Talking on the phone
When I'm alone, I'm in the zone
And tempted to touch you
Nothing ever fades
The way you take time for me
It makes me want you
Call it what you want
'Cause I'm so dumb
It may be wrong, but baby I'm your fool
I can verify, that you're my type
The things we try that others just won't do
Look at me shedding no tears
No worries followed by fear
So good that soon you'll be here

Your girlfriend
Alicia Keys
Uh huh
JD wha' wha'
Come on Alicia:
Maybe silly for me to feel this way about you and her
Cuz I know she's been such a good friend
I know she has helped you through Talkin late on the phone
Every night you've been callin'
Private moments alone
could your heart soon be fallin
And I know she's a friend
But I can't shake the feeling
That I could be losing your heart I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
Although she's just a girl that is your friend
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
She shares a special part of you Ohohoohoh
You said thats she's one who helped you see
How deep you're in love with me
And intentions were not to get in between
But I see possibilities And you say that you feel
I'm the best thing in your life
And I know it's real I see it in your eyes
There's no reason for me, to even feel this way
I know you just enjoy her company I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
Although she's just a girl that is your friend
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
She shares a special part of you I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
Although (you say) she's just a girl that is your friend
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
She shares a special part of you Ohohohoh
JD:
You say you're jealous but you can't tell me why
You say you're jealous but you can't tell me why
You say you're jealous but you can't tell me why
You say you're jealous but you can't tell me why
You say you're jealous but you can't tell me why
You say you're jealous but you can't tell me why
You say you're jealous but you can't tell me why
You say you're jealous but you can't tell me why Alicia:
It's enough to make a nigga go crazy oh-oh
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
Although she's just a girl that is your friend
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
She shares a special part of you some people they call me crazy
for falling in love with you
they can take me and lock me away baby
'cause there's nothing those bars can do i'll be the rising moon after setting sun
just to let you know you'll always have someone
i'll be the clearest day when the rain is done
so you'll always know through the shake of an earthquake
i will never fall
that's how strong my love is
like a ship through the storm
we can risk it all
that's how strong my love is i use to feel kinda lonely
cause the world it can be so fake
all that matters i'm telling you
is you and me only
and the fortress from love we make i'll be the water you need in the desert land
just to let you know you'll always have my hand
i'll be the woman you need to be a better man
so you'll always know through the shake of an earthquake
i will never fall
that's how strong my love is
like a ship through the storm
we can risk it all
that's how strong my love is oh, can't nothing break us down
oh, 'cause we are heaven bound
like the mountain standing tall:
immovable; we're here to stay
oh, can't nothing get in the way through the shake of an earthquake
i will never fall(i will never fall)
that's how strong my love is(that's how strong my love is)
like a ship through the storm
we can risk it all(we can risk it all)
that's how strong my love is(that love is) through the deepest waters
i won't let you drown (I won't let you drown Ohh!)
that's how strong my love is (Oh that's how strong my love, my love, my love)
cause we're the moon in the sky
that will never come down (never come down)
that's how strong my love is (Oh that's how strong my love is)
that's how strong my love is
that's how strong my love is When the wind is blowing in your face
Sometimes in life you don't see straight
Wait for him
He will show When your head is in a certain place
Nobody around to make you say
Stand strong and you will go Wait till you see my smile
Wait till they see your smile Don't they love to see you down
Kick you while you are on the ground
Don't let emotions show People always make you late
Don't let them get in your way
See they say things they don't know Wait till you see my smile
Wait till they see your smile Hey
So you doing better now
Everybody comes around
Cause you don't really need much
You are stronger and your better and you are ready for whatever
Saying
Wait till you see my smile
Wait till they see your smile
Wait till you see my smile
Wait till they see your smile Check it out
It feels kinda crazy These covers may keep me warm at night
But they can't take your place, cause they never gonna hold me tight
And these pillows, may let me rest my head
But they can't say good night and tuck me in before I go to bed
Say, "Naw baby girl, you're better off," that's what I'm telling myself
But I'm lying to myself cause I know I don't want nobody else These lips are missing you
Cause these lips ain't kissing you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
These arms are wanting you
Cause these arms ain't holding you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win These candles light up my room at night
But they can't light the room the way you did when you walked inside, oh baby
If these walls could sing about everything they've witnessed
Oh it'd be a sad, sad song, and it'll probably sound something like this
Say, "Naw baby girl, you're better off," that's what I'm telling myself
But I'm lying to myself cause I know I don't want nobody else Cause these lips are missing you
Cause these lips ain't kissing you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
These arms are wanting you
Cause these arms ain't holding you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win Tell me when the hell this loneliness is gonna be over
When everything in this room reminds me of you
Everytime I think I'm getting closer
These tears drown me out, once again I lose Cause these lips are missing you
Cause these lips ain't kissing you
I put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
These arms are wanting you
Cause these arms ain't holding you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win Crying like oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
Crying like oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these tears always win I'm a woman
Lord knows it's hard
I need a real man
to give me what I need Sweet attention
Love and tenderness
When it's real it's unconditional
I'm tellin Y'all Cause a man just ain't a man
If he ain't man enough
To love you when you're right
Love you when You're wrong
Love you when you're weak
Love you when you're strong

When the world's got you feelin low
He's givin you his last

Givin comfort when he's thinkin that you're hurt
That's what done when you really love someone
I'm tellin y'all Cause You're a real man
And lord knows it's hard

A woman's touch Sweet affection

To love you when you're right

I'm tellin y'all
I'm tellin y'all Oooh oooh, New York Grew up in a town
That is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud
There are sirens all around
And the streets are mean
If I could make it here
I could make it anywhere
That's what they say
Seeing my face in lights
Or my name in marquees found down Broadway Even if it ain't all it seems
I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew
Ladies work so hard
Such a melting pot on the corner selling rock
Preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab
Takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger
For more than from an empty fridge I'm going to make it by any means
I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all looking pretty
No place in the world that can compared
Put your lighters in the air
Everybody say yeah, yeah yeah I Know You
Don't Know What
I'm Going Through
Standing Here
Looking At You Let Me Tell Ya That It
Hurts So Bad
It Makes Me Feel So Sad
Oh It Hurts So Bad
To See You Again
Like Needles And Pins People Say
You're Making Out Okay
He's In Love
Don't Get In There Way Let Me Tell Ya That It
Hurts So Bad
It Makes Me Feel So Sad
You're Gonna Hurt So Bad
If You Walk Away Why Can't You Stay
And Let Me
Make It Up To You
I'll Do Anything
You Want Me To You Loved Me Before
Come Love Again
I Can't Let You Go
Back To Her
Please Don't Go
Please Don't Goooooo It Makes Me Feel So Sad
It's Gonna Hurt So Bad
If You Walk Away Please Don't Go
Please Don't Goooooo
Ohhh Ohhh Don't Make It Hurt So Bad
It's Gonna Hurt So Bad
To See You Again (Vocals) Money, some people so poor all that they got is money
Oh and diamonds
Some people waste their life counting their thousands
I don't care what they're offering,
How much gold they bring. They can't afford what we got,
Not even the king
They can't afford what we got,
Not even the king Ohhh castles, some people so lonely
What good is a castle?
Surrounded by people, but ain't got a friend,
That's not on the payroll.
Ohh, I don't care what they bring,
They can have everything. They can't afford what we got,
Not even the king
They can't afford what we got,
Not even the king All the king's horses and all the king's men,
Came charging to get what we got.
They offered the crown and they offered the throne
I already got all that I want
All the king's horses and all the king's men
They came marching through
They offered world just to have what we got. But I found the world in you,
I found the world in you.
So darling listen
Your arms around me worth more than a kingdom,
Yeah, believe that
The trust that we feel,
The king's never felt that.
Yeah, this is the song we sing
We don't need anything
They can't afford this
This is priceless. They can't afford what we've got
Not even the king
They can't afford what we got,
Not even the king Friends we've been for so long
Now true colors are showing
Makes me wanna cry oh yes it does
Cuz I had to say goodbye By now I should know
That in time things must change
So it shouldn't be so bad
So why do I feel so sad How can I adjust
To the way that things are going
It's killing me slowly
Oh I just want it to be how it used to be Cuz I wish that I could stay
But in time things must change
So it shouldn't be so bad
So why do I feel so sad You cannot hide the way you feel inside I realize
Your actions speak much louder than words
So tell me why oh By now I should know that
That in time things must change
So it shouldn't be it shouldn't be so bad
So why do I feel so sad By now I should know
That in time things must change
So it shouldn't be so bad
So why do I feel so sad By now by now i should know
that in time things must grow
and i had to leave to you behind
so why do i feel so sad
if it couldnt be that bad
tell me why? By now I should know
That in time things must grow
And I had to leave you behind
So why do I feel so sad
If it couldn't be that bad
Tell me why By now I should know
That in time things would change
So it shouldn't be so bad
So why do I feel so sad Sometimes I feel like I don't belong anywhere
It's gonna take so long for me to get to somewhere Sometimes I feel so heavy hearted
But I can't explain cause I'm so guarded
But that's a lonely road to travel
And a heavy load to bear And it's a long, long way to heaven
But I gotta get there...
Can you send an angel?
Can you send an angel? Cause I don't wanna feel
Like a dove with no wings
And I don't wanna know
What a heart of stone sings But that's a lonely road to travel
And a heavy load to bear
And it's a long, long way to heaven
But I gotta get there Can you send an angel?
Can you send me an angel?
Please send me an angel

If I can rise up then I will get there Cause I'm looking for a place to call my own
I'm looking for a house to make a home
I'm looking for seat upon a throne
I'm looking for a place to call my own The hardest place to go
Is where I've never gone before
It takes a brave, brave soul
But it makes you much stronger Now I feel so alive and there's no more cry
I chose to rise up and there's no deny That I've finally found a place to call my own
I've finally found a house to make a home
I've finally took a seat upon a throne
And now I have a place to call my own So many people
They try to make you
Make you believe that
You're nothing without them, no
Don't you believe it
Not for a minute
You gotta show love
This is the way! Now I have a place to call my own
Now I have a house to make a home
Now I have a seat upon a throne
Cause now I have a place to call my own I didn't bother about a thing I'll never worry about a thing There's a hole in my heart
I've been hiding
I've been strong for so long
That I'm blind
Is there a place
I can go where the lonely river flows?
Where fear ends and faith begins Hallelujah, hallelujah, let me in
I've been praying
But I'm paying for my sins
Won't you give me a sign
If I lose my mind?
Woah, hallelujah, let me in Every step makes me think
That I'm closer
But somehow
I just haven't arrived
When our hope disappears,
Please protect me from my fears
I need you right by my side Hallelujah, hallelujah, let me in
I've been praying
But I'm paying for my sins
Won't you give me a sign
If I lose my mind?

This pain in my heart just follows me by day
And at night it stalks me like the shadows on my wall
Oh my goodness, goodness Feel like the world is closing on me
Feel like my dreams will never come to me
I keep on slippin' deeper into myself
And I'm scared, so scared If you're troubled
You just gotta let it go
If you're worried, baby
You just gotta let it go
All your hustles ain't for nothing
You just gotta take it slow
When you need me, baby
All you do is let me know Why does it feel
That my mind is constantly trying to pull me down?
I can't seem to get away
Continuous mistakes I know, I've made before
How long will I feel so out of place? If you're troubled
You just gotta let it go
If you're worried, baby
You just gotta let it go
All your hustles ain't for nothing
You just gotta take it slow

Amen I said we're all God's children, products of the ghetto
Momma cooked the soup, daddy did the yelling
Uncle was a drunk, cousin was a felon
When he got pinched, he told them he wasn't tellin'
Auntie was a cook, her husband was a crook
Cause every job he had they be payin' him off the books
Ghetto University, knowledge is all it took
In the tenement I was listenin' to the hook
Change gon' come, the spirit of Sam Cooke
When the Feds coming, everybody be shook
Now we doing life like Eddie Murphy and Martin
On the chain gang, I was singing into the coffin The roaches and the rats, heroin and the crasp
Couldn't blame me, I'm just giving the facts
Tryna hit the top, the bottom ain't where it's at
Everybody got a path but you could never go back Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Sing yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sing yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sing yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sing yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I'm telling you like it is, how we ever gon' live?
If we ain't gettin' money, how we feedin' the kids?
It's a revolving door, when brothers be doing bids
I know it sound wrong but the dope'll be what it is
Survival of the fittest, this poor girl the illest
Broke mirrors and black cats give me heebie-geebies
Life seems hard, nothing ever comes easy
Whatever's in the dark, won't always become the light
If you ain't in a battle, how you gon' win the fight?
Gotta speak the truth when I'm up in the booth
The streets be flyin' birds but they don't be on the roof
Poverty is a pain like you pulling a tooth
Told the streets don't let me go like I'm bishop and juice The roaches and the rats, heroin and the cracks
Couldn't blame me, I'm just giving the facts
Tryna hit the top, the bottom ain't where it's at
Everybody got a path but you could never go back Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Sing yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sing yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sing yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Baby I fly, you're the only one I need in my life
Baby I just don't know how to describe
How lovely you make me feel inside You give me butterflyz
Have me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz
You give me butterflies
Have me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz It seemed like the likely thing
From the start you told me yeah, I would be your queen
But never had I imagined such a feeling
Joy is what you bring, I wanna give you everything
You give me butterflyz
Have me flying so high in the sky I can't control the butterflyz
You give me butterflyz
Have me flying so high in the sky
I can't control these butterflyz
You and I are destiny
I know that you were made for me I can't control it, it's drivin' me
Takin' over me and I
You give me butterflyz
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz You give me butterflyz
Have me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz
You give me butterflyz

I can't control, I can't control it You give me butterflyz
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz, oh no, oh no
You give me something I just can't deny
Something that's so real
I just can't control the way I feel and I don't feel
You give me something I just can't deny
Something that's so real
I just can't control the way I feel
Oh I never felt like this It would be
It would be
It would be, so simple 
What it is ain't what it was
What should it be, when it comes to you and
How it seems ain't how it is
There's been a change, when it comes to me
and 
Oh baby you,
Oh baby me,
Oh maybe we,
Can try another day another way 
All in my mind,
I'm wonderin' why,
We cannot find,
What was left at the beginning
If I could 
Meet you again
Kiss you again
Miss you again
(It would be, it would be so simple) 
Cause I would
Love you again
Hold you again
Need you again
(It would be, it would be...
could it be, could it be so simple) 
Now it's hardly simple
It's just simply hard
When it comes to you and
I find myself not being myself
Just to avoid
All this confrontation with 
Oh baby you,
Oh baby me,
Oh maybe we,
Can put this armor down and settle down 
Oh it's off track
That is a fact
Can we get it back
Get it back to the beginning
If I could Meet you again
Kiss you again
Miss you again
(It would be, it would be so simple) 
Cause I would
Love you again
Hold you again
Need you again
(It would be, it would be...
could it be, could it be so simple) 
Don't you know that it would be
Don't you know that it would be
Don't you know that it would be 
It would be
It would be
It it would be
It would be 
Meet you again
Kiss you again
Miss you again
(It would be, it would be so simple) 
Cause I would
Love you again
Hold you again
Need you again
(It would be, it would be...
could it be, it would be so simple) la, la, la, la, la, la, la
la, la, la, la, la, la, la I'm just tryna hold onto to a dream
Out here lost and nothing's what it seems
I'm just tryna find where I belong
This must be the dark before the dawn
When the place that you were born is not where you belong
Tell me baby, what stops you from wearing a crown?
I wanna be somebody, be somebody
And I wanna go somewhere, go somewhere Back to life, life, life, life, life, life, life, baby
Back to life, life, life, life, life, life, life, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
Back to life, life, life, life, life, life, life, baby
Back to life, life, I been waiting for all of my life
Back to life, mmm... Climb out from the bottom baby
No more looking back only straight up
Foot on the pedal baby, it's time to find what you're made of
Everybody wants to be adored
You don't have to settle for being enough Back to life, back to life
Nothing can break you
I will survive, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Back to life I'm not made to be locked up
If a bird don't fly, then what were wings made for?
Oh, I'm not meant to be locked up
And if I don't try, then what was I made for? Back to life, back to life
Nothing can break you
I will survive, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Back to life I would pawn you my watch
I would pawn you my chain
I would pawn you this golden diamond ring
'Cause I need it so bad
I would give you everything
Just so I could start my life over again Sometimes you gotta let it go
Just to make it possible
Sometimes you gotta do it
Be willing to lose it
Freedom has no price, you know
Thinking how we gonna make it now
How we gonna feed the babies now
We gonna make it through it
God gonna see to it
Just get up and do it now I would pawn you my watch
I would pawn you my chain
I would pawn you this golden diamond ring
'Cause I need it so bad
I would give you everything
Just so I could start my life over again Get on up (hey)
Get on up (hey)
Get on up (hey)
Get on up (hey)
Get on up (hey) See, I learned the hard way
Now I'm doing it in my way
'Cause life is too short to fall in New York
Can't get up and get away
So I gotta let it all go
Start back from zero
'Cause I've give it up, I don't give a fuck
'Cause love is my hero I would pawn you my watch
I would pawn you my chain
I would pawn you this golden diamond ring
'Cause I need it so bad
I would give you everything
Just so I could start my life over again I would pawn you my watch
I would pawn you my chain
I would pawn you this golden diamond ring
'Cause I need it so bad
I would give you everything
Just so I could start my life over again Get on up (hey)
Get on up (hey)
Get on up (hey)
Get on up (hey)
Get on up (hey) Beautiful garden where have you gone
My self-delusions are leaving me in the storm
Taking for granted all the goodness that I've found
Somewhere I lost all, the control came crashing down And I pray for forgiveness, look for the answers
Cuz it's hard for me to pretend
Look to my mother, call to the captain
Can't you see this state that I'm in
And no one would know this, nobody noticed
Cuz it's me where it begins Beautiful morning please don't wake me from my sleep
Cuz I need some comfort to regain my sanity
And I don't wanna feel this crazy, I don't wanna feel discarded
Shattered into million pieces I'm so brokenhearted
Nowhere left to run
Nowhere left to go
So I hope And I pray for forgiveness, look for the answers Cuz it's hard for me to pretend
Look to my mother, call to the captain
Can't you see this state that I'm in
And no one would know this, nobody noticed
That it's me where it begins
And I pray for forgiveness within I swear that everyday I feel like my mind is haunting me
I think of every little stupid mistake that has been made
This time I don't have the strength to gather myself
And I'm falling to pieces And I pray for forgiveness, look for the answers
Cuz it's hard for me to pretend
Look to my mother, call to the captain
Can't you see this state that I'm in
I pray for forgiveness, looking for justice
Searching for answers, call to my mother
Pray for forgiveness, breaking the silence
And nobody knows this, nobody noticed
That it's me where it begins

By listening to squeals of the PJ wheels
As we land, I duck down, I stick my head up
My dick is being sucked down by a bitch named What Now
I look in her eyes and her eyes are like an orange star
Look at the reflection of my foreign car, the R & R
I stick my feet out, you know the Bapes that's made of eel
You know the new shits with Nigo face right on the heel
I was in marching band, I was a skateboarder
Jesus made wine, I couldn't make water
Oxymoronic, I'm here to destroy all you hate hoarders
You niggas was cool in school, now you niggas take orders
I'm not dissin your job
But now you listen and nod
Some Outer Limits shit, I know this position is odd
Don't gasp for air
You can turn blue
Look, excel nigga

You can do it too young love

I did you can do it too I know niggas is like, there's no returning when I
Bought that white 5-50
So white that the coke heads just might try sniff
Or ordered the Phantom coupe, that's smoke pipe grey
And the interior was like crack rock beige
At least that's what it looked like when it was on that page
I combed the whole brochure and it did not say, oh well
Life's a bitch, but not too extreme
Life's got a fat ass
Trust me, I'mma fuck full steam
I make the world cream and scream while I'm gettin my cream
I'm Coming To America call me Prince Akeem, yessir
It's kinda weird, cause this our dream
Kinda prophetic, you get it
Cause this I've seen
These type of visions, since I was teen
I told my teacher what I saw, she said I missed Visine
Laughed with the class, but with the slightest clue
You be buying my shit, and I be rappin' to you
But you can do it too You can do it too young love
You can do it too young love
Just watch what you do young love
And watch whose in your crew young love
It don't matter if you do drugs
And even if you threw slugs
You can do it too young love
I did you can do it too I know you heard the story about the dude with the attitude
Pharrell he don't even know you but he mad at you
He got robbed and it seems he has accused
He's really frustrated and that it all he has is you
So, things propel and things excel
The next thing bang comes out the barrell
And my man they accused sittin' tight up in jail
Ironically close, my man Lou can hear him yell
I ain't do it but somebody dropped him flat
I felt the wind from it, that was God cocking back
I got a call from Virginia grandma went back
The line was fluctuated but it just now went flat
See her body went down and her soul went up
She sent angels around me so evil could not touch
I don't lie no more and I'm haunted when I fuck
Wealthy niggas with a conscience, yeah you know what's up
The wires across, and it's breeding a plague
The conscience is hungry, and it's eating away
Trying to make sense of it, but it's speedy in vain
Up all night with the books and you read till the day
But ya still high sadity cause you got a little paper
Push a cat in the corner, trust me it's the nature
Never underestimate the-things you do
Read Job verse 2, inhale the "oo", and go You can do it too young love
You can do it too young love
Just watch what you do young love
And watch whose in your crew young love
It don't matter if you do drugs
And even if you threw slugs
You can do it too young love
I did you can do it too Don't be afraid to look up the sky
Don't be afraid to look up the sky
Don't be afraid to look up the sky
Don't be afraid to look up the sky
Don't be afraid to look up the sky

Talk about relationships, I used to be a player
And like Geico, the time I saved 'em
And get their motors runnin', runnin', vroom-vroom

And finally, they'll know the story of our lives

Sometimes I only did what was required
I'm a sinner
Sometimes I sat down when I got tired
Should've stayed standing up
To do the job for which I was hired
But the good Lord

TV's watching it escalate
Smoke signals going up (read the signs)
It'll take your breath away
But they don't know how we act now
We'll turn our tomorrow into yesterday
Don't you nest away
C'mon, get dressed ok
Ddressed ok) Grab someone you love
There's something special on the other side of this moment
(Moment, moment, moment)
And it's about what you and I decide

For something overdone
You've been undertouched, well I can make you overcome
I know he telling you what he can make you and
I know he telling you where he can take you
By the way ma', hey is that your hair?
If it ain't, it took two days in the hair-shop chair
Im just joking
I make you smile right? Look, come here, I mean excuse me baby
You dancing fast ma' this ain't Merengue
But your butt in search of your volantes
It's plump I'm being honest, cause it's just nice
You're looking different saying to yourself
(This no right)
Sure you cute, but you know you won't dismiss this plight
When my chain keep binking like Christmas lights
Get it right (Yezzir) Yo what's up ma' You may not know Spanish, But you know Daddy Yankee
Sin uso de esteroides
Y tiendas aqui en Miami
Latin hustler!
Somos los duenos de los biscochos y los suplimos a costo
You know mamacita tu si ere dinamita
Y me la explota si te pones bien perrita
Ten cuidao! el perro ta ajitao!
Sacudelo cause your body is son fuego
La vida real en mi corazon la llevo ma'
Keep it going son los matones
Con los pies en la tierra y la mente en millones
Yankee Y Pharrell dandote la rumba buena
Con my sabor que la comida de abuela (Hey girl!) Let's go finish at mi casa
Trust me, it'd be proper
I got muchos negros on my lache with the choppers
If they suspect us, someone trespasa
All you hear is BRRRAT and then scream, Cucaracha!
Trust me, P is no pimp
See I got heavy pockets, so I walk with a limp
One night with he, and I'll make ya scream
You'll wake up, (wake up) like it's a dream
Call downstairs, tell em to make us P.J.s
Right after that, dry cycle our P.J.S
Right after that, book us a P.J
What you mean, how? When you got money, it's easy
This ain't dookie, ma, I'm not Green Day
Wake up, you're about to miss your damn dream day
Now everybody just sing what the screen say
It goes One more time, I gotta tell you now
One more time, tell you We've been down together for so long
Solid and strong
The lights went on
Wasn't your memory you forgot about
When you were down and out
You left dirt in my mouth I know you're probably saying "G"
I know you said it but woah, woah, woah
'Cause you really didn't believe
You didn't think that we would go, go, go Well, don't you know what they say about the show?
Well, even if you don't play, it must go on
You have decided to stay, you wanna be home
But don't take it no way, me and my bros
We just got to do it (do it)
Do it (do it) do it (do it) do it (he-ya)
One more time, we just got to do it (do it)
Do it (do it) do it (do it) do it (he-ya)
One more time, gotta tell you now If I gotta do it alone, I will
Roll this boulder up this hill
Roll up my sleeves, no chill
Be rolling, you can sit still
More like family there were no bounds
We used to ride towns
And burn them all down I know you're probably saying "G"
I know you said it but woah, woah, woah
'Cause you really didn't believe
You didn't think that we would go, go, go Well, don't you know what they say about the show?
Well, even if you don't play, it must go on
You have decided to stay, you wanna be home
But don't take it no way, me and my bros
We just got to do it (do it)
Do it (do it) do it (do it) do it (he-ya)
One more time, we just got to do it (do it)
Do it (do it) do it (do it) do it (he-ya) Like most real snowglobe
Distracted and confused
Gotta make yo' mind up
This is yours to lose
Things will always pop up
Like snowflakes they will move
I know that sounds real cold, but
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do? Can't tell what two dudes not allow
You don't like crowds
But you gotta get out
You could change the world if you change your route
You gotta leave your house
Go outside out I know you're probably saying "G"
I know you said it but woah, woah, woah
'Cause you really didn't believe
You didn't think that we would go, go, go Well, don't you know what they say about the show?
Well, even if you don't play, it must go on
You have decided to stay, you wanna be home
But don't take it no way, me and my bros
We just got to do it (do it)
Do it (do it) do it (do it) do it (he-ya)
One more time, we just got to do it (do it)
Do it (do it) do it (do it) do it (he-ya)
One more time, gotta tell you now Summertime in Virginia was a oven (oven)
All the kids eating ice cream with their cousins (cousins)
I was studying while you was playing the dozens (dozens)
Don't act like you was there when you wasn't Runnin' from the man (man)
Runnin' from the badge (badge)
Don't act like you was there when you wasn't
Runnin' toward our plans (plans) and the judges hands (hands)
Don't act like you was there when you wasn't I know they say you crawl for your own
But in my mind I already jog
If I stand still I cannot get far
They want the Moon, I'm on Mars Sometime my mind dives deep
When I'm runnin'
I don't want no free ride
I'm just sick and tired of runnin'
Some nights I cry
Cause I can see the day comin'
Together we fight
Oh, but no more runnin' You and I are not different from each other (other)
Shut our eyes, when we slumber I see numbers (numbers)
Black and white, we're computers, I am colored (colored)
Don't act like you was there when you wasn't From runnin' to exams (exams) to jobs for a man (man)
Don't act like you was there when you wasn't
In the law of the land (land) the women were often banned (banned)
Don't act like you was there when you wasn't I know they say you crawl for your own
But in my mind I already jog
If I stand still I cannot get far
They want the Moon, I'm on Mars Sometime my mind dives deep
When I'm runnin'
I don't want no free ride
I'm just sick and tired of runnin'
Some nights I cry
Cause I can see the day comin'

You're 19?
No, you're lighting in a bottle i give you a ring tomorrow
The scene that follows
Screams of horror
Classic Steven King novel
Mamma dont think you should take someone so advanced in romance
You should just wait
Pappa dont preach
Hove dont bight

Young girl, so in love with you (this is where the story begins baby) Yessur!..haha..Lil'Skateboard P
Hey! Mr.Vener!
Ah-huh... Yo... Ola 
Billionaire Club muchacho. Assorted flavors. And they zillatos
Inspire young minds. I stack my nachos with the raw determination of a vato
Run across the border with bricks in his poncho
Face like a shot when it's bussin' by glocko
Planted these things. Still I died when the Holy Father hand me my wings
When I was young, yo, the teacher couldn't stand when we dreamed
Givin' me music like drugs and to hand to a fiend
They shoot it up
See me on the TV the cuties - they wanna fuck
Both residential that's plush and cooped it up
Got more hits than a zip. Who want it nuh?
I can go back in time you be Judge Ito. With my mini-torpedo
I know you're thinking "neat-o!"
It would peace the men. It's something like Antigo
But it's three hundred thousand more with no re-mo
Jacob and Lorraine, I used to deal with Tito
But he clowned me and told me that my money's fritos
Now the Enzo doors go up like a D-Lo....
Ree-on... same song sung by my man Nigo. SLR
When the doors go up it's like a fresh L jar
Nigga we boss
He shall not get hot he too frost. Yessur! 
My nigga close your eyes. Just picture yourself just holdin' pies
Implement a plan and you surely rise. This promised by the man that controls the skies
Don't you see I know that shit so ill. Better yet, doggie, just tell me how ya feel
Ha-ha.. How you feel dawg?!
We just picture, thinkin', dreamin', scheming, bleedin', readin', all in the late night
Shake it, boilin', lacin', bakin', shapin', shavin', gotta get this cake right
As I serve it, you just burn it, breathe it, learn it, now watch it take flight...
Nigga how does it feel? Ha-ha..Yessur! ) 
Nigga you don't know me
I'm part Howard Hughes, part horny, part holy
First trick on the ramp is the rockin' rollie
Keep one on my staff with a new pro chromey
It bequeaths me to mention that I've been bitten
But affords me to chuckle at what critics have written
He dresses insane - but his music admire
Ask Anna Wintour from Vogue and Esquire
And Vanity Fair. You like, kid of the year
But you should guess who's in the insanity chair
Now it ain't about what I want
Still thumbin' through my life like it's drugstore porn
It's one thing to say that you did it
It's one thing to lie about your digits
It's one thing to say that you live it
It's another for you fuckers to admit it
But I admit I got all this paper plus the prettiest faces that's offered by nature
I drive a cas'per, 'scuse me, Casper
Wanna meet 'em in my house I got space like NASA
But it don't make me happier, by itself, or sadder
Or like my sister Stace when she lost her pappa
Or Ben dad, getting' a stroke, and nothin' the Trapper John could do
It's ironic but true - a man dies, baby born its fair as Peru
It's a simple clue between us and imposters
We hop in the air and don't care what it costs us
Now I'm with N.E.R.D. with a pit full of moshers
I guess you could say that we fly like saucers
Zappin' at niggas, we're classin' at vigor
The cash and crash whippers, the Thrasher mag gripper
Go 'head and say it "You a rappin' ass nigga."
Yessur! 
My nigga close your eyes. Just picture yourself just holdin' pies
Implement a plan and you surely rise. This promised by the man that controls the skies
Don't you see I know that shit so ill. Better yet, doggie, just tell me how ya feel
Ha-ha.. How you feel dawg?!
We just picture, thinkin', dreamin', scheming, bleedin', readin', all in the late night
Shake it, boilin', lacin', bakin', shapin', shavin', gotta get this cake right
As I serve it, you just burn it, breathe it, learn it, now watch it take flight...
Nigga how does it feel? Ha-ha..Yessur! )

I don't care if ya can't see her wings
Watch her fly, yeah, mothafuka oh oh We do this in your sleep niggaz
Yessir You eva been in love before?
Let me holla at u man
You know it's hard for a playa
To admit that sumtimes But I'm a spit that sumtimes
You know wat I'm sayin'
Ay P, give it to 'em one time, nephew There's sumthin' 'bout this girl
From around my way
Ever try to hold back your feelings
But it just wouldn't stay? But when I finally found the words to say
I wanted to run away
Simply run away You can try to run and hide
It won't make a difference
You can lie to yourself
Of the reason Sure it hurts
When it comes to your attention
That your in love with the girl Yessir, that's her
But it wasn't like that back when I met her
The lavish life from all the do?
Spun before the RR had the hitchhike thumb Her friends didn't like niggaz like us
But I arrested the coochie
And her feelings got cuffed Spiderweb sex, must'a got caught up
But there's more to it, I remember once
Sayin' let's shit on the peons Let's go to Vegas and watch Celine Dion
Make 'em say what we want?
You say no like you was doin' it for eons Fuck it, I'll just hum and
Let the watch give off the neons
When it rains it pours
I laughs to myself wen I change the score You said my sex was a lot
But my brain gave you more
And sumone 'bout how ya ex was a toy I guess, he played games
There's only diamond dice here
Not tryin' ta justify
But wen ya shut ya eye you can touch the sky You in trouble ma
And you should pray about speed
But if this 'bout you
What that say about me? But when I finally found the words to say
I wanted to run away
Simply run away You can try to run and hide
It won't make a difference
You can lie to yourself
Of the reason Sure it hurts
When it comes to your attention
That your in love with the girl See I'm a crip in dark blue chucks
And I does what I does
Yea I might say 'cause?
It's really weird 'cause a nigga got love Snoop Dogg's a crip
And the girl was a blood
(What?)
She told me that her baby daddy was a thug Now it is what it is and it was how it was
I'm hollin' li'l mama like what
Money mo stacked tryin ta get my G's back
All these memories breed seeds of
A rhythm rhyme pleaser Laid back while we sippin' on a breeza
Fresh 4 pack sittin' in the freeza
Ain't that kadeeja? I heard she was a Skeeza?
She used ta hit them licks wit the Beezas When I seen her wit the homies
I was like, Jesus
It's been a li'l min since I seen her
Hope her man don't run up
'Cause I'll have to pull the Neena There's sumthin' bout this girl
From around my way
Ever try to hold back your feelings
But it just wouldn't stay? But when I finally found the words to say
I wanted to run away
Simply run away You can try to run and hide
It won't make a difference
You can lie to yourself
Of the reason Sure it hurts
When it comes to your attention
That your in love with the girl You the it girl, hey hey, my inspiration
My compass spinnin', baby, it's the right destination
Come on, come on, tell me what I came for
I got treasure to hide, so let's keep it from the strangers, hey
Your waves, they wash all over me
Your tides, they pull me back to sea
When you bite on my lip
And hold my hand, and moan again, I'ma hold that ass
When you kiss on my lips
And hold my hand, and moan again, I'ma hold that ass You don't know, I've been missin' you
Baby when you, go, I'm missin' you
Truly gettin' me high, I be missin' you
You make me downright seasick
Oh the only way you can do that to me You the it girl, hey hey, my inspiration
My compass spinnin', baby, it's the right destination
Come on, come on, tell me what I came for
I got treasure to hide, so let's keep it from the strangers, hey

Your tides, they pull me back to sea
When you bite on my lip
And hold my hand, and moan again, I'ma hold that ass
When you kiss on my lips
And hold my hand, and moan again, I'ma hold that ass I know you don't get chance to take a break this often

(I know you don't get chance to take...) (I'm just, I just wanna tell you, something) Mama help I fell in love with a young girl (That's true, so true)
(You're the only girl I love too, but) My heart was soakin' and I broke it in a young world (So true, so true, listen) I wasn't trying to lead her on
See I didn't want to be alone
But when she smiles she brought me home
So I brought her home
Its not that the feeling of love is gone
Can't expect a college girl to be grown
I can't give a fuck what so and so says
Crushes hurt both ways What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do Mama help I fell in love with a young girl! What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Young girl, so in love with you
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do My heart was soakin' and I broke it in a young world What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
Young girl, so in love with you The single girls are out tonight ("hey, Pharrell!")
But you have my word, my heart, my life
And I'm not looking around
So why you lookin' down? (what you lookin down for?) I fucked up a long time ago
See I should have never let you know
See I couldn't give a fuck what tabloids say
(As the People Magazine)
And crushes hurt both ways What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do Mama help I fell in love with a young girl! What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
Young girl, so in love with you
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do (uh huh) My heart was soakin' and I broke it in a young world What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
Young girl, so in love with you Hov got a young girl
Hov got a young girl
Still not quite 21
So high strung, such a vibrant thing
I introduce myself, "Hi, Miss Thing"
You're 19?
No, you're lighting in a bottle I give you a ring tomorrow
The scene that follows
Screams of horror
Classic Steven King novel
Mama don't think you should take someone
So advanced in romance, you should just wait
Papa don't preach, Hov don't bite
Hov been threw it I might mold your life
Cause I'mma show you right
Proper etiquette, how to hold your knife
Keep it competitive with Oprah's ice
Be like Janet, take control of your life What on earth, what I'm supposed to do (young girl)
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do (young girl)
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do (young girl)
Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do (young girl) Mama help I fell in love with a young girl! What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(Too young, a little too young)
Young girl, so in love with you
(Just a little too young)
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(She's a...) (Too young, a little too young)
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(She's a...) (Just a little too young)
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(She's a...) (Too young, a little too young)
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do
(She's a...) (Just a little too young!) My heart was soakin' and I broke it in a young world What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
Young girl, so in love with you This is where it all begins, baby Y-yea . . .
The flow so amazin' nigga!
Uh, it's yo boy . . young
Uh huh, I brought Rell wit me
Timbo on the track
J-Breezy! Take it easy I got ya homie
Let's do the damn thing Rell When girls stop and stare it's obvious it's the "Roc"
Your vision's impaired it's obvious it's the watch
Park nine for being pasumptious
It could be that ash it cuts in my ear or some shit
Oh stop your dumb shit, Hov is hot
It ain't just hoes and guns shit, I switch top
Big sneakers can't see wit their op-tics
They optical allusions don't confuse dudes wit him
Uh, it's obvious stayin' used to win
Used to being in that Jeep deuce deuce like him
G-4 land a teeted barrel (whoo)
Fitted sombrero to the side, nigga my stride is so ghetto
Projects strut, hop out the plane hop in my truck
Just in time, hop off my thugs
It's obvious you got hate in you thug
You want the crown you got to take it in blood
Nigga what! (c'mon) Wit every step, wit every move
Scared of me, in the mood
All I see, is her and me
Gettin' down, I said gettin' down!
I love her frown, I love her smile
Most of all, I love that she's wild
Watchin' her, watchin' me
Escapin' to her, she's talkin' to me! Girl, I can tell by the look in your eyes
and the way that you back it up
I can tell that you like it rough rough - oh yes it's obvious!
Plus, I'm a freak and I know it's your style
cause we get bubble while makin' love
I can tell that you like it rough rough - oh yes it's obvious! It's in your walk, it's in your vibe
In your claws, some in your eyes
Chasin' you, you chasin' me
We belong, like Adam and Eve
You're the Queen, I'm the King
Shall no one, intervene
Kinky things, thuggish things
Crazy things, anything! [Chorus] I can, I can tell
I can, I can tell that you like it rough
I can tell, I can tell that you like it rough
I can tell, I can tell that you like it rough (I can't deny it baby!)
I can tell, I can tell that you like it rough (so don't complicate it!) [Bridge: Rell]
Don't complicate it (noo no)
Be my lady (love or hate it)
Love or hate it (nooo)
You belong to me (babe)
Don't complicate it (said don't complicate it)
Be my lady (be my lady)
Don't contemplate it (nooo nooo)
You belong to me [Chorus] (2x) Our Father, which art in Heaven
I'm so grateful of all the beautiful things
That You are allowing me to see
The birds, bees The ability to do what I do
The opportunities, I know You love me right
And I think it's time and my duty to tell the world
(Jesus is my daddy, I'm tellin' you)
Won't let me fall You watch for who I'm friends with
I got tattoos, You forgive me
You know I'm so sensitive
You know I'm chased by women You know my mind is driven
To you my heart is given
That's right You're the greatest
You're the greatest
You're the greatest
(Jesus is my daddy, I'm telling you)
You're the greatest, don't let me fall They don't understand what You do for me
(Do for me)
And judging by my actions, they don't I believe
(I believe)
Not talking 'bout what I wear, where I drive or where I sleep
(Where I sleep)
I mean the ability to hear, feel and sleep You're the greatest
You're the greatest
You're the greatest
(Jesus is my daddy, I'm telling you)
You're the greatest, don't let me fall Thank You for my brothers
Thank You for my daddy
(Daddy)
Thank You for my mother
So happy that she had me For that I was shown love
(Shown love)
And hearts that's filled with hatred
Thank You for my power
It won't intoxicate me You're the greatest
You're the greatest
You're the greatest
('Cause Jesus is my daddy, I'm telling you)
You're the greatest, don't letj me fall I'm trying to teach the kids there's more than meets the eye
(More than meets the eye)
And if they keep Your ferns, then I ply and make it fly
(Ply and make it fly) I'm not saying that I'm the fruit that the famish minded needs
(Fantasy)
But when I listen to You I know I could be the seed You're the greatest
You're the greatest
You're the greatest
(Jesus is my daddy, I'm telling you)
You're the greatest, don't let me fall Hey Girl...

[Instrumental] Different This one goes out to all the lovers
What can we do? We're helpless romantics
We can not help who we're attracted to
So let's all dance, and elevate each other Dear diary, it's happenin' again
This energy, like I'm 'bout to win
I just close my eyes and visions appear
She's everything I want, and it's crystal clear
Not even Marilyn Monroe
Queen Cleopatra please
Not even Joan of Arc
That don't mean nothin' to me
I just want a different girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough Why, why do I have to lie
Pretend, make believe or hide her?
When I love what I've described
But then again, I don't need no adjectives for this girl What's wrong with that?
What's wrong with that? Yeah
What's wrong with that? In honor of the groove and to all who's surrendered to it
We say thank you, and we take it back Wished so hard, I wished so hard that it came true
Then my lucky star, I guess you came from behind the moon
I put my arms around her, and I promise not to abuse you
Since now I found you, why the hell would I want to lose you? Preface
In this conversation, Kanye West and Pharrell Williams candidly explore the rewards and perils of a lifelong, perfectionist ethic. Best likened to a child's insatiable curiosity, they impute their compulsive, insistent tinkering to much lived experience, and even to obscure neurological phenomena. Their exchange lends precious - and comic - insight into a frightening capacity for invention, and a knowing approach to craft that is at once sure and relentlessly self-critical. They spoke in the wake of a minor controversy that followed the online launch of the single "Theraflu", which Kanye released through his G.O.O.D Music label (in collaboration with DJ Khaled, DJ Pharris and the producer Hit Boy). Predictably, the pharmaceutical combine Novartis objected to the title. The track also featured the lyric "someone tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor," which drew immediate fire from the animal-rights group
Kanye West: Yo yo, what's good?!
Pharrell Williams: What up, killer?!
KW: Shit, chillin', vibin' about changing the name of that song and trying to figure out what the name of the song should be. You know, the "Theraflu" song?
PW: Yeah
KW: Yeah, we're about to give it a new name
PW: It's getting that big - they're going that crazy about it?
KW: Oh, yeah they have an issue. Just the title and here's still a window of opportunity for us to change it. "Oh, well, I don't want to call it 'Theraflu'. I'm calling the song this..." And then people are like, "oh, he changed the song to this", and then that's what it is, because when I did the song, I actually did not know that it would get to the point that grandmothers are talking about it, you know? Like why did I give them that level of promotion?
PW: Yeah, trust me, they're thankful. No matter what, they're thankful. This segues perfectly into what I wanted to talk to you about. Which is what is it like to be - and I know how I feel about it - but you're definitely one of my peers, and one that I look at and say "He gets it, but I'd love to hear his take on why we aspire to be." It's almost a disease to be a perfectionist. Nothing is ever quite good enough. What is it like to look at things and say to yourself, "I know that they don't get it but maybe one day they will."
KW: It is so funny this is such an example of being a perfectionist, right? This song is out and I'm going to change the name, like I want to perfect this moment some more. Well, I think it's just if you're a perfectionist, that's just what you do. You know, there are slackers there are people who are satisfied by delivering everything they have - with their knowledge, their financial situation, their level of exposure - to deliver the best product possible. I respect, look up to, and look to Walt Disney and Steve Jobs who dedicated their time, soul and energy to delivering the best product that they knew they could. There's a lot of psychology that goes into it. What can you give to human existence? How can you push the culture forward? And when you're a perfectionist, at a certain point you feel a responsibility in what you put out, and what could trickle down from it. If you put out things that are so over-the-top and magnificent, what trickles down from it could at least be good because there are more followers than there are leaders
PW: Yeah I agree...You know what the funny thing is that we've never done it on a Kanye West album, it might be time for that
KW: Yeah!
PW: It might be time for that
KW: Yeah, we started on that shit for [Watch] The Throne
PW: Oh yeah! That was a very serious moment...
KW: Yes!
PW: I'll never forget going to you and Jay's show, and just seeing those laser lights. You addressed all the sensations, with the exception of smell and taste, I guess. Anything that you could control, the auditory and the visual, you curated - you made sure that it was a curated moment. And I'll never forget when the first bars of "Gotta Have It" started playing, that minor chord. It just hits you anyway but it was just y'all talking on top of the track as it starts to come on, and the crowd start going nuts! And it's really because at the end of the day, as great as the track is as it is and as great as all of the stuff you guys did on top of it, it was how the moment was so set up. It was like an incredible layup, an alley-oop. Do people even say that word anymore, alley-oop?
KW: Yeah, it's only 'cause it happens
PW: [laughs] yeah, you know I don't know anything about basketball, but it was an amazing set-up. That was crazy, just to see the reaction to what a visual and music could do together, and those people going absolutely crazy I was like "oh, ok, well done man, well done."
KW: Yeah I definitely wanted to dial into that sound and mixing those textures together. I just want to dial into that more, I just want to set the note, like playing a few textures that I got for this new shit for the G.O.O.D. Music joint we opened up the album with this joint that me and Skrillex did together
PW: Mmmmm. I like that!
KW: Just like that!
PW: Wow, I can't wait to hear what that sounds like. I know we are all shaped and moulded by all that we've gone through, and by having spirituality - in whatever way you define it - it allows us to be bigger than our bodies, to be bigger than our essence. [But] there is something to be said for experience, being told "no" the entire time, when you wanted to get into an industry that you love. So let me ask you, how much has this experience contributed to who you became as a person?
KW: Yeah, you know, I had to realize at what point to put off the real South Side Chicago mentality, that is what built me to deal with the amount of "no's" and deal with the amount of pressure and aggression, like I talked about on this Chicago song, "mink is draggin' on the floor." That's one of my ideas for it [renaming 'Theraflu']. "Swag King Cole, mink is dragin' on the floor, fo' I embarrass you, but I don't like to embarrass you...'I Don't Like To Embarrass You" as the title
PW: Anticipating PETA
KW: Yeah, so...when I say "I'm from where shorty's fucked up, double-cupped up. Might even kill some-body and YouTube it, so whoever thinks their words affect me is too stupid, and if you think you can do it better than me, then you do it."
PW: Yeah, "you do it!"
PW: [laughs]
KW: "I'm from Chicago." And that was just one of the best things to prepare me for anything. If you can make it out of Chicago, you can make it anywhere. That's what I'm talking about on this new song, that's what I'm talking about when I'm dealing with any business or creative processes. That's the stuff I'm talking about when I was dealing with people, from not wanting me to rap, to [not] doing the tour with Jay, and being able to do the light show for it It was like sit-ins, when we were going out to Paris. You know when we were wearing the outfits and people on the blogs were calling us names and all that, right? But then, once they got that Givenchy cover, and everybody's wearing Givenchy they're all like "oh this is cool."
PW: Right
KW: But it wasn't cool with South Park was using the photo and dissing us and everything. And so many people dress like that now
PW: [Laughs in agreement] Yeah, that's what we do
KW: That was before everybody said swag, or when we were out in Japan. How could you communicate through people? We're not even understanding the language but we knew the visual language, we knew the spirit, we knew the ideas, we knew the reference points
PW: Yeah, that's the thing, man. That's what separates us from a lot of folk, and not because we're better but because we've dedicated to listen to that inner voice, and a lot of people don't. A lot of people go "man!" they do something and they go "shit you know what, and I'm totally not da-da-da-da [fill in the blanks]." People fail a lot of times doing that. Whereas we just trained ourselves to say "you know what, let me entertain this idea" and exhaust all the possibilities to make sure that it doesn't make sense because something good may come out of that and for every time that someone has ever told you no, you've always had that willingness to explore it. Um, and I've watched that by the way, it's been cool to see. How are you enjoying that...
KW: - Enjoying what?
PW: I'm thinking of a way to put it...How are you enjoying this whole fame thing?
KW: [gasp] You know its just a process of separating things, it's understanding how to exploit it to display things, it's understanding how to exploit it to display amazing art. You know the whole trick is that I am a visual artist. To this day I can't play piano. I've taken it up a couple of times and I forget how to play the piano. And when I first wanted to rap, before I rapped, the first thing I did was actually draw my tape covers because that's back when people had tapes. I drew the cover before I even thought about doing music. Let's put this information in Vegas to music. So ina way I'll get the music but it was always about the fountain. It was always about the light show. It was always about the fashion show, it was always about that. Whether it is the font that we pick for a single cover, or a video - I'm going to Qatar later tonight to shoot the film for "Cruel Summer," which is basically my second pop fairytale, like how "Runaway" was - it creates that kind of opportunity. When you see me design, and I'm not saying it's the best design or whatever, but you know, [in "Runaway"] I had my idea of how I wanted Selita [Ebanks] to look, and I wanted it to be Selita. I wanted to juxtapose minimalist, Vanessa Beecroft like high art against unrealistic Victoria Secret-level beauty. They don't crash, those words are not in the same place. You've been to art parties before? It's different from a Victoria Secret's party. You know what I'm talking about!
PW: Right!
KW: That's right. Due to exposure, I'm able to have these things be seen by so many people. If Matthew Barney were more famous, then more people would see what Matthew Barney did. So it's that. When it comes down to it, what I enjoy about it is the opportunity to express art in high volume, literally
PW: Did you know that you're a synesthete? That you have synesthesia?
KW: That's what it's called, that's what the film is about! You're talking about seeing sounds right?
PW: There are many different forms of synesthesia. There are grapheme synethetes, people who see colors in numbers, letters in colours. But I believe most musicians and most artists are synesthetes
KW: You know that's what this film in Qatar is about!
PW: Oh wow!
KW: It's called Cruel Summer: The Legend of the Lamborghini Dons and it's basically the G.O.O.D Music Lamborghini Dons. [Kid] Cudi, he's the main character and I'm just this boy, and in the beginning we're car thieves. There's this part where one character teaches another to see colours through sound
PW: Oh wow!
KW: Yeah, the shit is dope. Matter of fact, if we could do work with you on the soundtrack. I mean I've got eight tracks for it, I just want to give it twelve. Basically it's the G.O.O.D Music soundtrack that "Mercy" is the first single for. You're like next level with this type of shit like [sings] "Take me far away, as long as it's fun, fun, fun, I wanna go." I'm talking to actually a film scorer at this point so -
PW: No! But dude....Nah man! It's funny that you picked that out ["Fun, Fun Fun"]. That's funny, wow!
KW: I play that song real normal in the car
PW: No way?!
KW: Yeah!
PW: That's crazy, that's crazy. 'Aight well say no more. I'mma holla at you soon. And you have a good time out there in Qatar. My man!
KW: Alright, thanks! Love It might seem crazy what I am about to say

But your looking far abroad
wishing upon the wrong star
Cause it don't know
That's not how it goes
So, I can't explain,

He made it that way
But the perplexities of world
Leaves more oysters and pearls
And I don't know It's just the way it goes
(But i know you can) Stay with me
Lock the door
Take the key
Hide yours
Feel the bape It is yours
It is yours
It is yours (Hey!) Don't take the time
To relax your mind
So unusual (ooh baby)
Put your priorities on the shelf
But your emotions and your health
just don't go
Your body says no,
So I can't conceive
That leaves would grow on trees and blow with the breeze
and comeback next spring
But the perplexities of life Brings more days that form new skies
So whose to know,

Lock the door
Take the key Hide yours
Feel the bape

Up, up and away
I'll be the wind beneath your wings
The vivid colors in your dreams (Ooooo-oh) Baby let's it pour it up
Let them galardo doors up
Pat eve for them Louis as soon as the tours up
The million dollar frame is his and her the same
I took it on the chin when i heard about the lame
I ain't here to try to rewrite your past (Naw)
That don't measure up to the nights that we laughed
When considering love you take the Good with the bad
I've been disappointed by every bitch i ever had
Either she was dick crazy or cheddar mad
Shame what they did for them jeans and them leather bags
Reverse it I want perfect
That was half the reason i bought half them purses
That chapter is over, it was worth it, my my new angel surfaced,

That's why i put the chill on her
So good make a nigga wanna kneel on her, not yet Stay with me

Do you wanna try?
Take off your halo and wings
Girl, I can make her fly I don't know, what's come over me
My momma didn't raise me that way
You lit a fire, from inside of me
That'd light your seat ablaze, girl
Light that ass on fire I could be the guy to treat you
To a nice movie, feed you
But I don't wanna mislead you
Tonight I think I wanna be dirty, girl
Do you wanna get dirty, girl? Come on
Light that ass on fire
Do you wanna get dirty, girl? Let's go Girl the world's watchin'
From sunset to midnight
They're tryna catch a glimpse (intimacy)
Of you and I I don't know, what's come over me
My momma didn't raise me that way
You lit a fire, from inside of me
That'd light your seat ablaze, girl

To experience the outer space

From the vibration of love You see I'd rather be a freq than not bein' me
Individuality makes life better

The individuality makes life better You gotta go inward
To experience the outer space
That was built for you
You gotta go inward Just picture the love
It's pickin' you up

From the vibration of love My heart is filled, with love and care
Not an ounce of gas, I would get up there
The answer's simple
You lift me up
The view up here, I see all the stars
There go Venus, and there go Mars
Somethin' you been through
You're from above Hey, when I first saw you, I got excited
Tried to keep my composure, tryna hide it
But I didn't know
I didn't let go
Then it occurred to me while tryna fight it
Just like a kite, you learn to ride it
But I didn't know You're s'posed to let it go Like a gust of wind
You hit me off sometimes
Like a gust of wind
You push me back every once in a while
Like a gust of wind
You remind me there's someone up there Who whooshes in
The air I need to power myself When I open the window
I wanna hug you
'Cause you remind me of the air
I said yeah
'Cause when I'm feelin' real low I remember I love you
I put my hands in the air
And you were there With your love, I can board the skies
Finding a way that electrifies, mother's your other
Cannot stow away Telephone winds of the northern sky
Is the closest thing, and here is why
'Cause we're color
You blow me away I need you, like I'm breathing
Music umbrellas can make one cover
Who cares if they don't see you? Don't you know that they're the same?
I need it like I'm breathing
If you never discover, forever you'll suffer
Who cares if they don't see you? You got until then to learn the way
Like a gust of wind
You hit me off sometimes Like a gust of wind
You push me back every once in a while
Like a gust of wind
You remind me there's someone up there
Who whooshes in The air I need to power myself
When I open the window
I wanna hug you
'Cause you remind me of the air
I said yeah
'Cause when I'm feelin' real low
I remember I love you
I put my hands in the air
And you were there
When I first saw you, I got excited
Tried to keep my composure, tryna hide it
But I didn't know
I didn't let go
Then I realized I'm tryna fight it
Just so they can learn to ride it
But I didn't know
I had to let it go
Like a gust of wind
You hit me off sometimes
Like a gust of wind
You push me back every once in a while
Like a gust of wind
You remind me there's someone up there
Who whooshes in
The air I need to power myself
When I open the window
I wanna hug you
'Cause you remind me of the air
I said yeah
'Cause when I'm feelin' real low
I remember I love you
I put my hands in the air
And you were there [Intro:]
Different [Verse 1:]
This one goes out to all the lovers
What can we do? We're helpless romantics
We can not help who we're attracted to
So let's all dance, and elevate each other [Chorus:]
Dear diary, it's happenin' again
This energy, like I'm 'bout to win
I just close my eyes and visions appear
She's everything I want, and it's crystal clear
Not even Marilyn Monroe
Who Cleopatra pleas
Not even Joan of Arc
That don't mean nothin' to me
I just want a different girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough [Verse 2:]
Why, why do I have to lie
Pretend, make believe or hide her?
When I love what I've described
But then again, I don't need no adjectives for this girl [Chorus x2] [Bridge:]
What's wrong with that?
What's wrong with that? Yeah
What's wrong with that? [Interlude: Girl]
In honor of the groove and all who's surrendered to it
We say thank you, and we take it back [Verse 3:]
Wished so hard, I wished so hard that it came true
Then my lucky star, I guess you came from behind the moon
I put my arms around her, and I promise not to abuse you
Since now I found you, why the hell would I want to lose you? [Chorus x2] I wish I could tell you how I feel
It don't make sense, trust me, I've tried
Nothing to prove, so I don't say nothin'
Just close my eyes, and I stand there
And I smile
Smile
I smile, for you Never give up on the things that, that can make you smile
Even if it means you gotta crawl for a thousand miles
Don't you worry, about how far to go
Enjoy the journey, and you know who you know you know (Cheers, cheers) Cause the moment they underestimate me, I win
(Cheers, cheers) To you, good life's success, good sex, and kids

Spit my gum out right now, yeah
What up world? Got my inspiration in the studio with me tonight, feelin' good
Got a lot to smile about
Talk to y'all niggas
Yessir, hey 
My best friend say I'm bottled up, I need a fucking therapist
But I can't think of nobody I wanna share this with
Why should I open up on somebody else's carelessness...
[Pop] there goes the top, nigga, so here it is
Mama workin' all day, Daddy out in the streets
Imagine 10 years old full of doubt and defeat
Growing up around criminals, with clout and deceit
My grandma Loucelle used to tell me, you about what you wheap
She used to help me with my homework, addiction-subtraction
Added faith to my life and doubt got subtracted
Wanna skip ya mind from crying better learn something, son
You be beatin' on my couches, why don't you try hit the drums?
Look, oo you see me ma
They wish they could be me ma
As I got better, her body was eaten by Leukaemia
Seventh grade, it was cursed and sad
But the gift within it, was when I first met Chad
But even Chad could tell you that my Christmas was jinxed
Cause grandma Loucelle died on 12th 19th
I can't help but wonder, what kind of black cloud I was under
Cause 15 years later the other died that summer...bummer 
My best friend told me, you be actin' tough, that's fine
But the weight of the world can really crush one's mind
So let it out P (what), let it out P (what)
Let it out P (what), let it out P (what)
See, you won't even know you hurt sometimes
Until you in conversation it comes out in a line so let it
Out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), my nigga let it out 
Ayo, 10 21 Atlantis drive, nigga was action packed
That's Atlantis apartments, we live in half the back
That's where the 12 year olds there, they be flashing crack
And when they shoot you nigga, they ain't tryna pass it back
Aye yo, Didi, Fleet and Marvian can you imagine that?
The place we love the most, the hood was built to smash us flat
But I escaped cause I chased, what made me passionate
Now I got my skate team and spit these acid raps
So many niggas will rise
So many them niggas try
So many them niggas ended up duck-taped and tied
So many them same niggas, man they moms eyes cry
So, they just got older, still on the corner with they pride
Well let me tell niggas something, I'm so glad you alive
Long as you got a breath, a pulse, nigga strive
Divine intervention this is
I heard a voice nigga, listen to this 
My best friend told me, you be actin' tough, that's fine
But the weight of the world can really crush one's mind
So let it out P (what), let it out P (what)
Let it out P (what), let it out P (what)
See, you won't even know you hurt sometimes
Until you in conversation it comes out in a line so let it
Out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), my nigga let it out 
Jesus will arrange it, but Jesus won't change it
Hold yourself responsible, on yourself you blame it
You mad, nigga don't articulate in Sanskrit
I.E. we best friends, speak best friend language
I'm a happy nigga, you can't approach me in anguish
Whoever said anything worth working for would be painless?
Can't be mad at the world cause you and your girl ain't famous
Cause you both on Bape, BBC and chain-less
Also you're Range-less, therefore switch lane-less
Now you brainless, dangerous, cause you pull out the stainless
All of sudden you smart, now you do something heinous
First time you get caught, now your ass is famous
No longer chain-less, and the bus switching lanes is a bad look
Yo girl with ya man sellin' lane-less, stop
Nigga rewind and reverse slides 3 times
Reassess your thinking and trust me it'll be fine
First picture your goal, and repeat 'It'll be mine'
Or fuck it nigga, just keep imagine killin' me fine
Now you, scrunching your face tryna ace attainment
When you should be tryna find a place to base your shame, nigga
Success is tangible, don't wait for fame
I thought you would receive it better if I ain't say ya name
You unsure of yourself, sit still and think
Review those actions if it fit, put your name in the blank 
My best friend told me, you be actin' tough, that's fine
But the weight of the world can really crush one's mind
So let it out P (what), let it out P (what)
Let it out P (what), let it out P (what)
See, you won't even know you hurt sometimes
Until you in conversation it comes out in a line so let it
Out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), my nigga let it out Star Trak, is who we are
Star Trak, is who we are, ooh
Star Trak, is who we are
Star Trak, is who we are

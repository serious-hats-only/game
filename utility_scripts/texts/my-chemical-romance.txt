When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, "Son, when you grow up
Would you be the saviour of the broken
The beaten and the damned?"
He said, "Will you defeat them
Your demons, and all the non-believers
The plans that they have made?"
"Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer
To join The Black Parade"
When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, "Son, when you grow up
Would you be the saviour of the broken
The beaten and the damned?"
Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know
We'll carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
You'll carry on
And in my heart I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it
A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back
Let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call
To carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches
On and on we carry through the fears
Oh, oh, oh
Disappointed faces of your peers
Oh, oh, oh
Take a look at me cause I could not care at all
Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy, who had to sing this song
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care
We'll carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
You'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches on
Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part (We'll carry on)
Do or die, you'll never make me (We'll carry on)
Because the world will never take my heart (We'll carry on)
Go and try, you'll never break me (We'll carry)
We want it all, we wanna play this part (We'll carry on)
Well, when you go
Don't ever think I'll make you try to stay
And maybe when you get back
I'll be off to find another way
And after all this time that you still owe
You're still a good-for-nothing I don't know
So take your gloves and get out
Better get out
While you can
When you go
Would you even turn to say
"I don't love you
Like I did
Yesterday"
Sometimes I cry so hard from pleading
So sick and tired of all the needless beating
But baby when they knock you
Down and out
Is where you oughta stay
And after all the blood that you still owe
Another dollar's just another blow
So fix your eyes and get up
Better get up
While you can
Whoa, whoa
When you go
Would you even turn to say
"I don't love you
Like I did
Yesterday"
Well come on, come on
When you go
Would you have the guts to say
"I don't love you
Like I loved you
Yesterday"
I don't love you
Like I loved you
Yesterday
I don't love you
Like I loved you
Yesterday
Long ago
Just like the hearse you die to get in again
We are so far from you
Burning on
Just like a match you strike to incinerate
The lives of everyone you know
And what's the worst you take (Worst you take)
From every heart you break? (Heart you break)
And like the blade you stain (Blade you stain)
Well, I've been holding on tonight
What's the worst that I could say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
Came a time
When every star fall
Brought you to tears again
We are the very hurt you sold
And what's the worst you take (Worst you take)
From every heart you break? (Heart you break)
And like the blade you stain (Blade you stain)
Well, I've been holding on tonight
What's the worst that I could say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
Well, if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
Can you hear me?
Are you near me?
Can we pretend
To leave and then
We'll meet again
When both our cars collide
What's the worst that I could say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
Well, if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
They're gonna clean up your looks
With all the lies in the books
To make a citizen out of you
Because they sleep with a gun
And keep an eye on you, son
So they can watch all the things you do
Because the drugs never work
They're gonna give you a smirk
'Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
They're gonna rip up your heads
Your aspirations to shreds
Another cog in the murder machine
They said: "All teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed"
So darken your clothes, or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
The boys and girls in the clique
The awful names that they stick
You're never gonna fit in much, kid
But if you're troubled and hurt
What you got under your shirt?
We'll make them pay for the things that they did
They said: "All teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed"
So darken your clothes, or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
They said: "All teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed"
So darken your clothes, or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
All together now!
Teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
So darken your clothes, or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me

Well if you wanted honesty, that's all you had to say.
I never want to let you down or have you go, it's better off this way.
For all the dirty looks, the photographs your boyfriend took,
Remember when you broke your foot from jumping out the second floor?
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out
What will it take to show you that it's not the life it seems?
(I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again you sing the words but don't know what it means
(I'm not okay)
To be a joke and look, another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook for the last time take a good hard look!
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out
Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you read me like a book, but the pages all are torn and frayed
I'm okay
I'm okay!
I'm okay, now
(I'm okay, now)
But you really need to listen to me
Because I'm telling you the truth
I mean this, I'm okay!
(Trust Me)
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
Well, I'm not okay
I'm not o-fucking-kay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
(Okay)
The future is bulletproof
The aftermath is secondary
It's time to do it now and do it loud
Killjoys
Make some noise
(Na na na...)
Drugs, gimme drugs, gimme drugs
I don't need it, but I'll sell what you got
Take the cash and I'll keep it
Eight legs to the wall
Hit the gas, kill them all
And we crawl, and we crawl, and we crawl
You be my detonator
Love, gimme love, gimme love
I don't need it, but I'll take what I want from your heart
And I'll keep it in a bag, in a box
Put an X on the floor
Gimme more, gimme more, gimme more
Shut up and sing it with me
(Na na na...)
From mall security
To every enemy
We're on your property
Standing in V formation
(Na na na...)
Let's blow an artery
Eat plastic surgery
Keep your apology
Give us more detonation
(More! Gimme more! Gimme more!)
Oh, let me tell you 'bout the sad man
Shut up and let me see your jazz hands
Remember when you were a madman
Thought you was Batman
And hit the party with a gas can
Kiss me you animal
(Na na na...)
You run the company
Fuck like a Kennedy
I think we'd rather be
Burning your information
(Na na na...)
Let's blow an artery
Eat plastic surgery
Keep your apology
Give us more detonation
And right here
Right now
All the way in Battery City
The little children
Raise their open filthy palms
Like tiny daggers up to heaven
And all the juvee halls
And the Ritalin rats
Ask angels made from neon
And fucking garbage
Scream out, "What will save us?"
And the sky opened up
Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one, no one wants to die
Wanna try, wanna try, wanna try
Wanna try, wanna try, now
I'll be your detonator
(Na na na...)
Make no apology
It's death or victory
On my authority
Crash and burn
Young and loaded
Drop like a bullet shell
Dress like a sleeper cell
I'd rather go to hell
Than be in purgatory
Cut my hair
Gag and bore me
Pull this pin
Let this world explode
Turn away
If you could get me a drink
Of water 'cause my lips are chapped and faded
Call my aunt Marie
Help her gather all my things
And bury me in all my favorite colors
My sisters and my brothers, still
I will not kiss you
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you
Now turn away
'Cause I'm awful just to see
'Cause all my hairs abandoned all my body
Oh, my agony
Know that I will never marry
Baby, I'm just soggy from the chemo
But counting down the days to go
It just ain't living
And I just hope you know
That if you say (If you say)
Goodbye today (Goodbye today)
I'd ask you to be true ('Cause I'd ask you to be true)
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you
Well I was there on the day
They sold the cause for the queen
And when the lights all went out
We watched our lives on the screen
I hate the ending myself
But it started with an alright scene
It was the roar of the crowd
That gave me heartache to sing
It was a lie when they smiled
And said, "You won't feel a thing"
And as we ran from the cops
We laughed so hard, it would sting
Yeah, yeah, oh
If I'm so wrong (So wrong, so wrong)
How can you listen all night long? (Night long, night long)
Now, will it matter after I'm gone?
Because you never learned a goddamn thing
You're just a sad song, with nothing to say
About a life-long wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you
I spent my high school career
Spit on and shoved to agree
So I could watch all my heroes sell a car on TV
Bring out the old guillotine
We'll show 'em what we all mean
Yeah, yeah, oh
If I'm so wrong (So wrong, so wrong)
How can you listen all night long? (Night long, night long)
Now, will it matter long after I'm gone?
Because you never learned a goddamn thing
You're just a sad song, with nothing to say
About a life-long wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you
So go, go away
Just go, run away
But, where did you run to?
And where did you hide?
Go find another way
Price you pay
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
You're just a sad song, with nothing to say
About a life-long wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you
Come on!
You're just a sad song, with nothing to say
About a life-long wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you
At all, at all, at all, at all
Now I know
That I can't make you stay
But where's your heart?
But where's your heart?
But where's your...
And I know
There's nothing I can say
To change that part
To change that part
To change...
So many
Bright lights, they cast a shadow
But can I speak?
Well is it hard understanding
I'm incomplete
A life that's so demanding
I get so weak
A love that's so demanding
I can't speak
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone
Honey if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home
Can you see
My eyes are shining bright
'Cause I'm out here
On the other side
Of a jet black hotel mirror
And I'm so weak
Is it hard understanding
I'm incomplete
A love that's so demanding
I get weak
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone
Honey if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone
Honey if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home
These bright lights have always blinded me
These bright lights have always blinded me
I say
I see you lying next to me
With words I thought I'd never speak
Awake and unafraid
Asleep or dead
(How can I see, I see you lying) 'Cause I see you lying next to me
(How can I see, I see you lying) With words I thought I'd never speak
(How can I see, I see you lying) Awake and unafraid
(How can I see, I see you lying) Asleep or dead
'Cause I see you lying next to me
With words I thought I'd never speak
Awake and unafraid
Asleep or dead
'Cause I see you lying next to me
With words I thought I'd never speak
Awake and unafraid
Asleep or dead
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone
(Or dead)
Honey if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home
(Or dead)
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone
(Or dead)
Honey if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home
(Or dead)
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone
(Or dead)
Honey if you stay, I'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home
I never
Said I'd lie and wait forever
If I died
We'd be together
I can't always just forget her
But she could try
At the end of the world
Or the last thing I see
You are never coming home, never coming home
Could I? Should I?
And all the things that you never ever told me
And all the smiles that are never ever
Ever get the feeling that you're never all alone?
And I remember now
At the top of my lungs in my arms she dies
She dies
At the end of the world
Or the last thing I see
You are never coming home, never coming home
Could I? Should I?
And all the things that you never ever told me
And all the smiles that are ever gonna haunt me
Never coming home, never coming home
Could I? Should I?
And all the wounds that are ever gonna scar me
For all the ghosts that are never gonna catch me
If I fall
If I fall
(Down)
At the end of the world
Or the last thing I see
You are never coming home, never coming home
Never coming home, never coming home
And all the things that you never ever told me
And all the smiles that are ever gonna haunt me
Never coming home, never coming home
Could I? Should I?
And all the wounds that are ever gonna scar me
For all the ghosts that are never gonna
Mama, we all go to hell
Mama, we all go to hell
I'm writing this letter and wishing you well
Mama, we all go to hell
Oh well now, Mama, we're all gonna die
Mama, we're all gonna die
Stop asking me questions, I'd hate to see you cry
Mama, we're all gonna die
And when we go don't blame us, yeah!
We'll let the fire just bathe us, yeah!
You made us oh so famous
We'll never let you go
And when you go don't return to me my love
Mama, we're all full of lies
Mama, we're meant for the flies
And right now they're building a coffin your size
Mama, we're all full of lies
Well mother look what the war did to my legs and to my tongue
You should have raised a baby girl
I should've been a better son
If you could coddle the infection
They can amputate at once
You should've been
I could have been a better son
And when we go don't blame us, yeah!
We'll let the fires just bathe us, yeah!
You made us oh so famous
We'll never let you go
She said, "You ain't no son of mine
For what you've done they're
Gonna find a place for you
And just you mind your manners when you go
And when you go, don't return to me, my love"
That's right
Mama, we all go to hell
Mama, we all go to hell
It's really quite pleasant except for the smell
Mama, we all go to hell
Two, three, four!
Mama, Mama, Mama, Ohhhh!
Mama, Mama, Mama, Ohhhh!
And if you would call me a sweetheart
I'd maybe then sing you a song
But there's shit that I've done with this fuck of a gun
You would cry out your eyes all along
We're damned after all
Through fortune and flame we fall
And if you can stay then I'll show you the way
To return from the ashes you call
We all carry on (We all carry on)
When our brothers in arms are gone (When our brothers in arms are gone)
So raise your glass high for tomorrow we die
And return from the ashes you call
Yeah!
And if your heart stops beating
I'll be here wondering
Did you get what you deserve?
The ending of your life
And if you get to heaven
I'll be here waiting, babe
Did you get what you deserve?
The end and if your life won't wait
Then your heart can't take this
Have you heard the news that you're dead?
No one ever had much nice to say
I think they never liked you anyway
Oh take me from the hospital bed
Wouldn't it be grand it ain't exactly what you planned
And wouldn't it be great if we were dead?
Oh, Dead.
Tongue-tied and oh so squeamish
You never fell in love
Did you get what you deserve?
The ending of your life
And if you get to heaven
I'll be here waiting, babe
Did you get what you deserve?
The end and if your life won't wait
Then your heart can't take this
Have you heard the news that you're dead?
No one ever had much nice to say
I think they never liked you anyway
Oh take me from the hospital bed
Wouldn't it be grand to take a pistol by the hand
And wouldn't it be great if we were dead
And in my honest observation
During this operation
Found a complication
In your heart
So long
'Cause now you've got
Maybe just two weeks to live
(Is that the most the both of you can give?)
One! Two!
One, two, three, four!
La la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Well come on
La la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Oh motherfucker
(If life ain't just a joke)
Then why are we laughing?
If life ain't just a joke
(Then why are we laughing?)
If life ain't just a joke
(Then why are we laughing?)
If life ain't just a joke
Then why am I dead?
Dead!
When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, "Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?"
He said, "Will you defeat them
Your demons, and all the non-believers
The plans that they have made?"
"Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer
To join the black parade."
(When I was a young boy)
(My father took me into the city)
(To see a marching band)
(He said, "Son, when you grow up)
(Would you be the savior of the broken)
(The beaten and the damned?")
Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know
We'll carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And in my heart I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it
A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back
Let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call
To carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches
On and on we carry through the fears
Oh, oh, oh
Disappointed faces of your peers
Oh, oh, oh
Take a look at me cause I could not care at all
Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scars
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy, who had to sing this song
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care
We'll carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches
Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
(We'll carry on!)
Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
(We'll carry on!)
Hand in mine, into your icy blues
And then I'd say to you, we could take to the highway
With this trunk of ammunition too
I'd end my days with you in a hail of bullets
I'm trying, I'm trying
To let you know just how much you mean to me
And after all the things
We put each other through and
I would drive on to the end with you
A liquor store or two keeps the gas tank full
And I feel like there's nothing left to do
But prove myself to you and we'll keep it running
But this time, I mean it
I'll let you know just how much you mean to me
As snow falls on desert sky
Until the end of everything
I'm trying, I'm trying
To let you know how much you mean
As days fade, and nights grow
And we go cold
Until the end, until this pool of blood
Until this, I mean this, I mean this
Until the end of
I'm trying, I'm trying
To let you know, how much you mean
As days fade, and nights grow
And we go cold
But this time, we'll show them
We'll show them all how much we mean
As snow falls on desert sky
Until the end of every
All we are, all we are
Is bullets I mean this
All we are, all we are
Is bullets I mean this
All we are, all we are
Is bullets I mean this
All we are, all we are
Is bullets I mean this
As lead rains, pass on through our phantoms
Forever, forever
Like scarecrows that fuel this flame on burning
Forever, and ever
Know how much I want to show you, you're the only one
Like a bed of roses, there's a dozen reasons in this gun
And as we're falling down, and in this pool of blood
And as we're touching hands, and as we're falling down
And in this pool of blood, and as we're falling down
I'll see your eyes, and in this pool of blood
I'll meet your eyes, I mean this forever
In the middle of a gun fight
In the center of a restaurant
They say,
"Come with your arms raised high!"
Well they're never gonna get me
I'm like a bullet through a flock of doves
To wage this war against your faith in me,
Your life
Will never be the same.
On your mother's eyes, say a prayer
Say a prayer!
Now,
But I can't
And I don't know
How we're just two men as God had made us
Well, I can't
Well, I can!
Too much, too late
Or just not enough of this
Pain in my heart for your dying wish
I'll kiss your lips again.
They all cheat at cards and the checkers are lost,
My cellmate's a killer
They make me do push-ups in drag
But nobody cares if you're losing yourself...
Am I losing myself?!
Well, I miss my Mom!
Will they give me the chair?
Or lethal injection, or swing from a rope if you dare
Oh, nobody knows all the trouble I've seen
Now,
But I can't
And I don't know
How we're just two men as God had made us
Well, I can't
Well, I can!
Too much, too late
Or just not enough of this
Pain in my heart for your dying wish
I'll kiss your lips again.
To your room
What they ask of you
They'll make you want to say,
"So long..."
Well, I don't remember,
Why remember
You!
Do you have the keys to the hotel?!
'Cause I'm gonna string this motherfucker on fire!
FIRE!
Instrumental
Life is but a dream for the dead,
And well I, I won't go down by myself,
But I'll go down with my friends.
Now, now, now, now
I can't explain it,
Now, yeah yeah!
I can't complain it
Now now now.
Now now now.

Cleaned-up corporation progress
Dying in the process
Children that can talk about it
Living on the web-ways
People moving sideways
Tell it 'till your last days
Buy yourself a motivation
Generation Nothing!
Nothing but a dead scene
Product of a white dream
I am not the singer that you wanted
But a dancer
I refuse to answer
Talk about the past, sir

Tonight
She got the call
And then she threw her jacket on
And stormed off down the hall
They got the call
And picked him up at 4am
And tore off down the road
And all the angels say oooh, oooh
You are all to blame
'Cause all the angels say oooh, oooh
You are all to blame
She went alone
And went to the emergency
And parked her car in the dark
They told her please
He only has but minutes more
You might just say goodbye
'Cause all the angels say oooh, oooh
You are all to blame
'Cause all the angels say oooh, oooh
You are all the same
And if you maybe figure it out
Would you still explain?
And if she said she was sorry now
Would you still complain?
And if you open up your heart
And stay so far away
But you are all the same
And if you maybe find a better way
To love me then
You are all to blame
'Cause all the angels say oooh, oooh
You are all to blame
'Cause all the angels say oooh, oooh
You are all to blame
So long to all of my friends
Every one of them met tragic ends
With every passing day
I'd be lying if I didn't say
That I miss them all tonight
And if they only knew what I would say
If I could be with you tonight
I would sing you to sleep
Never let them take the light behind your eyes
One day, I'll lose this fight
As we fade in the dark
Just remember you will always burn as bright
Be strong, and hold my hand
Time becomes for us, you'll understand
We'll say goodbye today
And I'm sorry how it ends this way
If you promise not to cry
Then I'll tell you just what I would say
If I could be with you tonight
I would sing you to sleep
Never let them take the light behind your eyes
I'll fail and lose this fight
Never fade in the dark
Just remember that you will always burn as bright
The light behind your eyes
The light behind your...
Sometimes we must grow stronger and
You can't be stronger in the dark
When I'm here no longer
You must be stronger and
If I could be with you tonight
I would sing you to sleep
Never let them take the light behind your eyes
I've failed and lost this fight
Never fade in the dark
Just remember you will always burn as bright
The light behind your eyes
The light behind your eyes
The light behind your eyes
The light behind your eyes
The light behind your eyes
The light behind your eyes
The light behind your eyes
The light behind your eyes
The light behind your eyes
The light behind your eyes
Well you can hide a lot about yourself
But honey, what are you gonna do?
And you can sleep in a coffin
But the past ain't through with you
Cause we are all a bunch of liars
Tell me baby, who do you wanna be?
And we are all about to sell it
Cause it's tragic with a capital T
Let it be, let it be, let it be!
Cause we all wanna party when the funeral ends
And we all get together when we bury our friends
It's been 8 bitter years since I've been seeing your face
And you're walking away
And I will die in this place
Sometimes you scrape and sink so low
I'm shocked at what you're capable of
And if this a coronation
I ain't feeling the love
Cause we are all a bunch of animals
That never paid attention in school
So tell me all about your problems
I was killing before killing was cool
You're so cool, you're so cool, so cool!
Cause we all wanna party when the funeral ends
And we all get together when we bury our friends
It's been 9 bitter years since I've been seeing your face
And you're walking away
And I will die in this place
You'll never take me alive, you'll never take me alive
Do what it takes to survive cause I'm still here
You'll never get me alive, you'll never take me alive
Do what it takes to survive and I'm still here
You'll never take me alive, you'll never get me alive
Do what it takes to survive and I'm still here
You'll never get me,
you'll never take me
You'll never get me alive
Cause we all wanna party when the funeral ends
And we all get together when we bury our friends
It's been 10 fucking years since I've been seeing your face round here
And you're walking away
And I will drown in the fear.
Well, they encourage your complete cooperation
Send you roses when they think you need to smile
I can't control myself because I don't know how
And they love me for it honestly, I'll be here for a while
So give them blood, blood, gallons of the stuff
Give them all that they can drink and it will never be enough
So give them blood, blood, blood
Grab a glass because there's going to be a flood
A celebrated man amongst the gurneys
They can fix me proper with a bit of luck
The doctors and the nurses they adore me so
But it's really quite alarming 'cause I'm such an awful fuck
(Oh, thank you)
I gave you blood, blood, gallons of the stuff
I gave you all that you can drink and it has never been enough
I gave you blood, blood, blood
I'm the kind of human wreckage that you love
Go!
To un-explain the unforgivable
Drain all the blood and give the kids a show
By streetlight this dark night
A séance down below
There's things that I have done
You never, should ever know
And without you is how I disappear
And live my life alone forever now
And without you is how I disappear
And live my life alone forever now
Who walks among the famous living dead
Drowns all the boys and girls inside your bed
And if you could talk to me tell me if it's so
That all the good girls go to Heaven
Well heaven knows
That without you is how I disappear
And live my life alone forever now
And without you is how I disappear
And live my life alone forever now
Can you hear me cry out to you?
Words I thought I'd choke on figure out
I'm really not so with you anymore
I'm just a ghost
So I can't hurt you anymore
So I can't hurt you anymore
And now, you wanna see how far down I can sink?
Let me go (Fuck!)
So you can
Well now, so you can
I'm so far away from you
Well now, so you can
And without you is how I disappear
And without you is how I disappear
Whoa, whoa (and without you is how I disappear)
Whoa, whoa (and without you, is how, is how, is how)
Forever, forever now
Well it rains and it pours when you're out on your own
If I crash on the couch can I sleep in my clothes?
'Cause I've spent the night dancing, I'm drunk I suppose
If it looks like I'm laughing, I'm really just asking to leave this alone
You're in time for the show
You're the one that I need, I'm the one that you loathe
You can watch me corrode like a beast in repose
'Cause I love all the poison away with the boys in the band
I've really been on a bender and it shows
So why don't you blow me a kiss before she goes?
Give me a shot to remember
And you can take all the pain away from me
Your kiss and I will surrender
The sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead
A light to burn all the empires
So bright the sun is ashamed to rise and be
In love with all of these vampires
So you can leave like the sane abandoned me
There's a place in the dark where the animals go
You can take off your skin in the cannibal glow
Juliet loves the beat and the lust it commands
Drop the dagger and lather the blood on your hands, Romeo
I've really been on a bender and it shows
So why don't you blow me a kiss before she goes?
Give me a shot to remember
And you can take all the pain away from me
Your kiss and I will surrender
The sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead
A light to burn all the empires
So bright the sun is ashamed to rise and be
In love with all of these vampires
So you can leave like the sane abandoned me
Give me a shot to remember
And you can take all the pain away from me
Your kiss and I will surrender
The sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead
A light to burn all the empires
So bright the sun is ashamed to rise and be
In love with all of these vampires
So you can leave like the sane abandoned me

Don't believe what they say,
We're dead flies in the summertime
They leave us all behind
With duct tape scars on my honey
They don't like who you are
You won't like where we'll go
Brother, protect me now
With blood they wash in the money!

Red-mob, we insects hide
King rat on the streets in another life
They laugh, we don't think it's funny
If what you are
Is just what you own
What have you become
When they take from you
ALMOST EVERYTHING
You don't believe in God
I don't believe in luck
They don't believe in us
But I believe we're the enemy!
You don't believe in God

Stay out of the light
Or the photograph that I gave you
You could say a prayer if you need to
But just get in line and I'll grieve you
Can I meet you alone?
Another night and I'll see you
Oh, another night and I'll be you
Some other way to continue
To hide my face
Another knife in my hands
A stain that never comes off the sheets
Clean me off
I'm so dirty, babe
The kind of dirty where the water never cleans off the clothes
I keep a book of the names and those
Only go so far
'Til you bury them
So deep and down we go
Touched by angels though
I fall out of grace
I did it all so maybe
I'd live this every day
Another knife in my hands
A stain that never comes off the sheets
Clean me off
I'm so dirty, babe
It ain't the money and it's sure as hell ain't just for the fame
It's for the bodies I claim and lose
Only go so far
'Til you bury them
So deep and down we go
Down
And down we go
And down we go
And down we go
And we all fall down
I tried
I tried
And we'll all dance alone to the tune of your death
We'll love again
We'll laugh again
And it's better off this way
And never again
And never again
They gave us two shots to the back of the head
And we're all dead now
Well, never again
And never again
They gave us two shots to the back of the head and we're all dead now
I tried
One more night
One more night
Well I'm laughing out, crying out, laugh out!
I tried
Well I tried
Well I tried
'Cause I tried
But I lied
I lied
I tried
I tried
I tried
And we'll love again
We'll laugh again.
We'll cry again and we'll dance again
And it's better off this way
So much better off this way
I can't clean the blood off the sheets in my bed
Well, never again
And never again
They gave us two shots to the back of the head
And we're all dead now
Sister, I'm not much a poet, but a criminal
And you never had a chance
Love it, or leave it, you can't understand a pretty face,
But you do, so carry on
and on
and on
I wouldn't front the scene if you paid me
I'm just the way that the doctor made me, on
and on
and on
and on
Love is the red, the rose on your coffin door
What's life like? Bleeding on the floor
the floor
the floor
You'll never make me leave
I wear this on my sleeve
Give me a reason to believe
So give me all your poison
And give me all your pills
And give me all your hopeless hearts and make me ill
You're running after something that you'll never kill
If this is what you want, then fire at will
Preach all you want but who's gonna save me?
I keep a gun on the book you gave me,
Hallelujah, lock and load
Black is the kiss, the touch of the serpent son
It ain't the mark or the scar that makes you run
and run
and run
and run.
You'll never make me leave
I wear this on my sleeve
Give me a reason to believe
So give me all your poison
And give me all your pills
And give me all your hopeless hearts and make me ill
You're running after something that you'll never kill
If this is what you want, then fire at will
You'll never make me leave
I wear this on my sleeve
You wanna follow something
Give me a better cause to lead
Just give me what I need
Give me a reason to believe
So give me all your poison
And give me all your pills
And give me all your hopeless hearts and make me ill
You're running after something that you'll never kill
If this is what you want, then fire at will
So give me all your poison (Fire at will)
And give me all your pills
And give me all your hopeless hearts (Fire at will) and make me ill
You're running after something (Fire at will) that you'll never kill
If this is what you want (Fire at will) then fire at will
For what you did to me
And what I'll do to you
You get, what everyone else gets
You get a lifetime
Let's go
Do you remember that day when we met?
You told me this gets harder, well, it did
Been holding on forever
Promise me that when I've gone
You'll kill my enemies
The damage you've inflicted, temporary wounds
I'm coming back from the dead
And I'll take you home with me
I'm taking back the life you stole
We never got that far
This helps me to think all through the night
Bright lights that won't kill me now or tell me how
Just you and I, your starless eyes remain
Hip hip hooray for me, you talk to me
But would you kill me in my sleep
Lay still like the dead
From the razor to the rosary
We could lose ourselves
And paint these walls in pitchfork red
I will avenge my ghost with every breath I take
I'm coming back from the dead
And I'll take you home with me
I'm taking back the life you stole
This hole that you put me in
Wasn't deep enough
And I'm climbing out right now
You're running out of places to hide from me
When you go
Just know that I will remember you
If living was the hardest part
We'll then one day be together
And in the end we'll fall apart
Just like the leaves changing colors
And then I will be with you
I will be there one last time now
When you go
Just know that I will remember you
I lost my fear of falling
I will be with you, I will be with you
Well, when you go
Don't ever think I'll make you try to stay
And maybe when you get back
I'll be off to find another way
And after all this time that you still owe
You're still a good-for-nothing I don't know
So take your gloves and get out
Better get out while you can
When you go would you even turn to say
"I don't love you like I did yesterday"?
Sometimes I cry so hard from pleading
So sick and tired of all the needless beating
But baby when they knock you down and out
It's where you oughta stay
Well after all the blood that you still owe
Another dollar's just another blow
So fix your eyes and get up
Better get up while you can, whoa whoa
When you go would you even turn to say
"I don't love you like I did yesterday"?
Well come on, come on!
When you go would you have the guts to say
"I don't love you like I loved you yesterday"?
I don't love you like I loved you yesterday
I don't love you like I loved you yesterday
Well, I know a thing about contrition
Because I got enough to spare
And I'll be granting your permission
'Cause you haven't got a prayer
Well I said hey, hey hallelujah
I'm gonna come on, sing the praise
And let the spirit come on through ya
We got innocence for days!
Well, I think I'm gonna burn in hell
Everybody burn the house right down
And say, ha
What I wanna say
Tell me I'm an angel
Take this to my grave
Tell me I'm a bad man
Kick me like a stray
Tell me I'm an angel
Take this to my grave
(S-I-N, I S-I-N
S-I-N, I S-I-N
S-I-N, I S-I-N
S-I-N, I S-I-N)
You play ring around the ambulance
Well, like you never gave a care
So get the choir boys around you
It's a compliment, I swear
And I said, ashes to ashes, we all fall down
I wanna hear you sing the praise
I said, ashes to ashes, we all fall down
We got innocence for days!
Well, I think I'm gonna burn in hell
Everybody burn the house right down
And say, ha
What I wanna say
Tell me I'm an angel
Take this to my grave
Tell me I'm a bad man
Kick me like a stray
Tell me I'm an angel
Take this to my grave
You better run like the Devil
'Cause they're never gonna leave you alone!
You better hide up in the alley
'Cause they're never gonna find you a home!
And as the blood runs down the walls
You see me creepin' up these halls
I've been a bad motherfucker
Tell your sister I'm another
Go! Go! Go!
And I said, say
What I wanna say
Tell me I'm an angel
Take this to my grave
Tell me I'm a bad man
Kick me like a stray
Tell me I'm an angel
Take this to my grave
Tell me I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad man
Tell me I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad man
Tell me I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad man
Tell me I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad man
So get up!
So get out!
S-I-N, I S-I-N!
When the lights go out
Will you take me with you?
And carry all this broken bone
Through six years down in crowded rooms
And highways I call home
Is something I can't know till now
Till you pick me off the ground
With brick in hand, your lip gloss smile
Your scraped-up knees and
If you stay
I would even wait all night
Or until my heart explodes
How long?
Until we find our way
In the dark and out of harm
You can runaway with me
Anytime you want
Terrified of what I'd be
As a kid from what I've seen
Every single day when people try
And put the pieces back together
Just to smash them down
Turn my headphones up real loud
I don't think I need them now
Cause you stop the noise and
If you stay
I would even wait all night
Or until my heart explodes
How long?
Until we find our way
In the dark and out of harm
You can runaway with me
Anytime you want
Well anytime you want
Don't walk away
Cause if you stay
I would even wait all night
Well or until my heart explodes
How long?
Until we find our way
In the dark and out of harm
You can runaway with me
You can write it on your arm
You can run away with me
Anytime you want
This night
Walk the dead
In a solitary style and crash the cemetery gates
In the dress your husband hates
Way down
Mark the grave
Where the searchlights find us drinking by the mausoleum door
And they found you on the bathroom floor
I miss you
I miss you so far
And the collision of your kiss that made it so hard
Back home
Off the run
Singing songs that make you slit your wrists
It isn't that much fun
Staring down a loaded gun
So I won't stop dying
Won't stop lying
If you want I'll keep on crying
Did you get what you deserve?
Is this what you always want me for?
I miss you
I miss you so far
And the collision of your kiss that made it so hard
Way down
Way down
Way down
Way down
Way down
Way down
Way down
Way down
I miss you
I miss you so far
And the collision of your kiss that made it so hard
And well I miss you
And well I miss you so far
And the collision of your kiss that made it so hard
That made it so hard
Way down
Way down
Way down
Way down
Way down
Way down
Way down
Way down
Way down
Well are you ready, Ray? Yeah.
How 'bout you Frank? Oh, I'm there, baby.
How 'bout you Mikey? Fuckin' ready.
Well I think I'm alright. 1-2-3-4
3-2-1 We came to fuck
Everybody party till the gasman comes
Sparkle like Bowie in the morning Sun
And get a parking violation on La Brea till it's done
Hair back, collar up
Jet black, so cool
Sing it like the kids that are mean to you
C'mon
When you wanna be a movie star
C'mon
Play the game and take the band real far
C'mon
Play it right and drive a Volvo car
C'mon
Pick a fight at an airport bar
The kids don't care if you're all right honey
Pills don't help but it sure is funny
Gimme gimme some of that vampire money, come on!
You look like somebody I used to love...
Well ah, 3-2-1 We got the bomb
Everybody hurry till the tax man comes
Glimmer like Bolan in the morning Sun
and get your finger on the trigger tap the barrel of a gun
Hair back, motherfucker
Jet black, so cool
Sing it like the kids that are mean to you
C'mon
When you wanna be a movie star
C'mon
Play the game and take the band real far
C'mon
Play it right and drive a Volvo car
C'mon
Pick a fight at an airport bar
The kids don't care if you're all right honey
Pills don't help but it sure is funny
Gimme gimme some of that vampire money, come on!
That's right!
1-2-3-4!
Well ah, 3-2-1 we came to fuck
Everybody party till the gasman comes
Sparkle like Bowie in the morning Sun
And get a parking violation on La Brea till it's done
Hair back, collar up
Jet black, so cool
Sing it like the kids that are mean to you
C'mon
When you want to be a movie star
C'mon
Play the game and take the band real far
C'mon
Play it right and drive a Volvo car
C'mon
Pick a fight at an airport bar
The kids don't care if you're all right honey
Pills don't help but it sure is funny
Gimme gimme some of that vampire money, come on!
Come on!
Come. On
Come. On
Come. On
Come. On
This party
I think it's way too loud
Gonna have to turn it down a little
I'm sorry
Well now this could be last of all the rides we take
So hold on tight and don't look back
We don't care about the message or the rules they make
I'll find you when the Sun goes black
And you only live forever in the lights you make
When we were young, we used to say
That you only hear the music when your heart begins to break
Now we are the kids from yesterday
All the cameras watch the accidents and stars you hate
They only care if you can bleed
Does the television make you feel the pills you ate?
Or every person that you need to be?
'Cause you only live forever in the lights you make
When we were young, we used to say
That you only hear the music when your heart begins to break
Now we are the kids from yesterday
Today
Today
We are the kids from yesterday
Today
Today
Here we are and we won't stop breathing
Yell it out 'till your heart stops beating
We are the kids from yesterday
Today
'Cause you only live forever in the lights you make
When we were young, we used to say
That you only hear the music when your heart begins to break
Now we are the kids from yesterday
We are the kids from yesterday
We are the kids from yesterday
We are the kids from yesterday
Today
Today.
Oh baby here comes the sound!
I took a train outta New Orleans
And they shot me full of ephedrine
This is how we like to do it in the murder scene
Can we settle up the score?
If you were here
I'd never have a fear
So go on live your life
But I miss you more than I did yesterday
You're beautiful!
Well, I'm a total wreck and almost every day
Like the firing squad or the mess you made
Well, don't I look pretty walking down the street
In the best damn dress I own?
If you were here
I'd never have a fear
So go on live your life
But I miss you more than I did yesterday
You're so far away
So c'mon show me how
'Cause I mean this more than words could ever say
Some might say
We are made from the sharpest things you'd say
We are young and we don't care (Oh wah-oh)
Your dreams and your hopeless hair (Oh wah-oh)
We never wanted it to be this way
For all our lives
Do you care at all?
If you were here
I'd never have a fear
So go on live your life
But I miss you more than I did yesterday
You're so far away
So c'mon show me how
'Cause I mean this more than words could ever say
(What'd you call me?)
(Well, there's no way I'm kissing that guy!)
Well come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Yeah
And if they get me and the sun goes down into the ground
And if they get me take this spike to my heart and
And if they get me and the sun goes down
And if they get me take this spike and
You put the spike in my heart!!!
And if the sun comes up will it tear the skin right off our bones
And then as razor sharp white teeth rip out our necks I saw you there
Someone get me to the doctor, someone get me to a church
Where they can pump this venom gaping hole
And you must keep your soul like a secret in your throat
And if they come and get me
You put the spike in my heart
And if they get me and the sun goes down
And if they get me take this spike and Can you take this spike?
Will it fill our hearts with thoughts of endless
Night time sky
Can you take this spike?
Will it wash away this jet black feeling?
And now the nightclub sets the stage for this
they come in pairs she said
We'll shoot back holy water
like cheap whiskey they're always there
Someone get me to the doctor, and someone call the nurse
And someone buy me roses, and someone burn the church
We're hanging out with corpses, and driving in this hearse
And someone save my soul tonight, please save my soul
Can you take this spike?
Will it fill our hearts with thoughts of endless
Night time sky
Can you take this spike?
Will it wash away this jet black now?
And as these days watch over time,
and as these days watch over time
And as these days watch over us tonight I'll never let them, I'll never let them
I'll never let them hurt you not tonight
I'll never let them, I can't forget them
I'll never let them hurt you, I promise
Struck down, before our prime
Before, you got off the floor
Can you stake my heart? Can you stake my heart?
Can you stake my heart? Can you stake my heart?
Can you stake my heart? Can you stake my heart?
Can you stake me before the sun goes down?
Gaze into her killing jar I'd sometimes stare for hours
(Sometimes stare for hours)
She even poked the holes so I can breathe
She bought the last line
I'm just the worst kind
Of guy to argue
With what you might find
And for the last night I lie
Could I lie with you?
Alright
Give up
Get down
It's just the hardest part of living
Alright
She wants
It all
To come down this time
(I'm) lost in the prescription
She's got something else in mind
(Something else in mind)
Check into the hotel Bella Muerte
It gives the weak flight
It gives the blind sight
Until the cops come
Or by the last light
And for the last night I lie
Could I lie next to you?
Alright
Give up
Get down
It's just the hardest part of living
Alright
She wants
It all
To come down this time
Alright
Give up
Get down
It's just the hardest part of living
Alright
She wants
It all
To come down this time
Pull the plug
But I'd like to learn your name
When holding on
Oh I hope you do the same
Aww sugar
Slip into the tragedy
You've spun this chamber dry
Alright
Give up
Get down
It's just the hardest part of living
Alright
She wants
It all
To come down this time
Alright
Give up
Get down
It's just the hardest part of living
Alright
She wants
It all
To come down this time
Pull the plug
But I'd like to learn your name
And holding on
Well I hope you do the same
Aww sugar
"They're... They're these terrors
And it's like, it feels like as if somebody was gripping my...
They're these terrors
And it's like, it feels like as if somebody was gripping my throat
They're not like tremors, they're worse than tremors
They're... They're these terrors
Like last night, they're not like tremors, they are worse than tremors
They're... They're these terrors
And it's like, it feels like as if somebody
was gripping my throat and squeezing and...
Feels like as if somebody was gripping my throat"
Some say, now suffer all the children
And walk away a savior
Or a madman and polluted
From gutter institutions
Don't you breathe for me
Undeserving of your sympathy
'Cause there ain't no way that I'm sorry for what I did
And through it all
How could you cry for me?
'Cause I don't feel bad about it
So shut your eyes
Kiss me goodbye
And sleep
Just sleep
The hardest part is letting go of your dreams
A drink for the horror that I'm in
For the good guys, and the bad guys
For the monsters that I've been
Three cheers for tyranny
Unapologetic apathy
'Cause there ain't no way that I'm coming back again
And through it all
How could you cry for me?
'Cause I don't feel bad about it
So shut your eyes
Kiss me goodbye
And sleep
Just sleep
The hardest part's the awful things that I've seen
"Sometimes, I see flames
And sometimes I see people that I love dying and it's always..."
Just sleep
Just sleep
Just sleep
Just sleep
Just sleep
Just sleep
Wake up!
"And I can't... I can't ever wake up"
Yeah!
And if your heart stops beating
I'll be here wondering
Did you get what you deserve?
The ending of your life
And if you get to heaven
I'll be here waiting, babe
Did you get what you deserve?
The end and if your life won't wait
Then your heart can't take this
Have you heard the news that you're dead?
No one ever had much nice to say
I think they never liked you anyway
Oh take me from the hospital bed
Wouldn't it be grand it ain't exactly what you planned
And wouldn't it be great if we were dead?
Oh, Dead.
Tongue-tied and oh so squeamish
You never fell in love
Did you get what you deserve?
The ending of your life
And if you get to heaven
I'll be here waiting, babe
Did you get what you deserve?
The end and if your life won't wait
Then your heart can't take this
Have you heard the news that you're dead?
No one ever had much nice to say
I think they never liked you anyway
Oh take me from the hospital bed
Wouldn't it be grand to take a pistol by the hand
And wouldn't it be great if we were dead
And in my honest observation
During this operation
Found a complication
In your heart
So long
'Cause now you've got
Maybe just two weeks to live
(Is that the most the both of you can give?)
One! Two!
One, two, three, four!
La la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Well come on
La la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Oh motherfucker
(If life ain't just a joke)
Then why are we laughing?
If life ain't just a joke
(Then why are we laughing?)
If life ain't just a joke
(Then why are we laughing?)
If life ain't just a joke
Then why am I dead?
Dead!
These are the eyes and the lies of the taken
These are their hearts but their hearts don't beat like ours
They burn 'cause they are all afraid
For everyone of us, there's an army of them
But you'll never fight alone
'Cause I wanted you to know
That the world is ugly
But you're beautiful to me
Well are you thinking of me now? (now)
These are the nights and the lights that we fade in
These are the words, but the words aren't coming out
They burn 'cause they are hard to say
For every failing sun, there's a morning after
Though I'm empty when you go
I just wanted you to know
That the world is ugly
But you're beautiful to me
Are you thinking of me?
Like I'm thinking of you?
I would say I'm sorry though
Though I really need to go
I just wanted you to know
I wanted you to know
I wanted you to know
I'm thinking of you every night, every day
These are the lies and the lives of the taken
These are their hearts but their hearts don't beat like ours
They burn 'cause they are all afraid
But mine beats twice as hard
'Cause the world is ugly
But you're beautiful to me
Are you thinking of me?
Like I'm thinking of you?
I would say I'm sorry though
Though I really need to go
And I just wanted you to know
That the world is ugly (I just wanted you to know)
But you're beautiful to me (I just wanted you to know)
Are you thinking of me?
Stop your crying
Helpless feeling
Dry your eyes and start believing
There's one thing they'll never take from you
(And then your face, will never be the same
Never, forever
Like ghosts in the snow, like ghosts in the sun)
ACOUSTIC
They're selling postcards of the hanging
Well, they're painting the passports brown
Yeah, the beauty parlor's filled with sailors
The circus is in town
Oh no, but here comes the blind commissioner
Well, they've got him in a trance
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
The other's in his pants
And the riot squad, they're restless
They need somewhere to go
As Lady and I look out tonight from
Desolation Row
Oh, Cinderella, she seems so easy
"Well, it takes one to know one," she smiles
And she puts her hands in her back pockets
Bette Davis style
Now, but here comes Romeo, moaning
"You belong to me, I believe"
And someone says
"You're in the wrong place, my friend
You better leave"
And then the only sound that's left
After the ambulances go
Is Cinderella sweeping up on
Desolation Row
Yeah, at midnight all the agents
And superhuman crew
Go out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do
They're gonna bring them to the factory
Where the heart-attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene
Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Check to see that no one is escaping to
Desolation Row
And so now
I can't read too good
Don't send me no letters, no!
Not unless you gotta mail them from
Desolation Row
Long ago
Just like the hearse you die to get in again
We are so far from you
Burning on
Just like a match you strike to incinerate
The lives of everyone you know
And what's the worst you take (Worst you take)
From every heart you break? (Heart you break)
And like the blade you stain (Blade you stain)
Well, I've been holding on tonight
What's the worst that I could say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
Came a time
When every star fall
Brought you to tears again
We are the very hurt you sold
And what's the worst you take (Worst you take)
From every heart you break? (Heart you break)
And like the blade you stain (Blade you stain)
Well, I've been holding on tonight
What's the worst that I could say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
Well, if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
Can you hear me?
Are you near me?
Can we pretend
To leave and then
We'll meet again
When both our cars collide
What's the worst that I could say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
Well, if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
You're not in this alone
Let me break this awkward silence
Let me go!
Go on record
Be the first to say I'm sorry
Hear me out
And if you take me down
Would you lay me out?
And if the world needs something better
Let's give them one more reason now
We walk in single file
We light our rails and punch our time
Ride escalators colder than a cell
This broken city sky
Like butane on my skin
Stolen from my eyes
Hello angel, tell me
Where are you?
Tell me, where we go from here
This broken city sky
Like butane on my skin
Stolen from my eyes
Hello angel, tell me
Where are you?
Tell me where we go from here
Tell me we go from...
And in this moment we can't close the lids
On burning eyes
Our memories blanket us with friends we know
Like fallout vapor
Steel corpses stretch out towards an ending sun
Scorched and black
It reaches in and tears your flesh apart
As ice cold hands rip into your heart
That's if you've still got one that's left
Inside that cave you call a chest
And after seeing what we saw
Can we still reclaim our innocence?
And if the world needs something better
Let's give them one more reason now
This broken city sky
Like butane on my skin
And stolen from my eyes
Hello angel, tell me
Where are you?
Tell me, where we go from here
This broken city sky
Like butane on my skin
Stolen from my eyes
Hello angel, tell me
Where are you?
Tell me where we go from here
Tell me where we go from here...
Move your body when the sunlight dies
Everybody hide your body from the scarecrow
Everybody hide
Make a wish when your childhood dies
Hear the knock, knock, knock when she cries
We're all alone tonight
Hold your breath when a black bird flies
Count to seventeen and close your eyes
I'll keep you safe inside
He burns my skin
Never mind about the shape I'm in
I'll keep you safe tonight, yeah, yeah
Safe tonight
Move your body when the sunlight dies
Everybody hide your body from the scarecrow
Everybody hide
Move your body when the sunlight dies
Everybody hide your body from the scarecrow
Everybody hide
Blow a kiss at the methane skies
See the walls through your playground eyes
We're all in love tonight
Leave a dream where the fallout lies
Watch it grow where the tearstains dry
To keep you safe tonight
He burns my skin
Never mind about the shape I'm in
I'll keep you safe tonight, yeah, yeah
Safe tonight
Move your body when the sunlight dies
Everybody hide your body from the scarecrow
Everybody hide
Move your body when the sunlight dies
Everybody hide your body from the scarecrow
Everybody hide
Love, love, love won't stop this bomb, bomb
Love won't stop this bomb, bomb
Love won't stop this bomb
Run, run, bunny, run
Run, run, bunny, run
Move your body when the sunlight dies
Everybody hide your body from the scarecrow
Everybody hide
Move your body when the sunlight dies
Everybody hide your body from the scarecrow
Everybody hide
Move your body when the sunlight dies
Everybody hide your body from the scarecrow
Everybody hide
Move your body when the sunlight dies
Everybody hide your body from the scarecrow
Everybody hide
Gravity
Don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be
These pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, if we could run away
Run away from here
I got a bulletproof heart
You got a hollow-point smile
Me and your runaway scars
Got a photograph dream on the getaway mile
Let's blow a hole in this town
And do our talking with a laser beam
Gunning out of this place in a bullet's embrace
Then we'll do it again
How can they say
"Jenny could you come back home?"
'Cause everybody knows you don't
Ever want to come back
Let me be the one to save you
Gravity
Don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be
These pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, if we could run away
Run away from here
I'm shooting out of this room
Because I sure don't like the company
Stop your preaching right there
'Cause I really don't care
And I'll do it again
So get me out of my head
'Cause it's getting kind of cramped you know
Coming ready or not
When the motor gets hot
We can do it again
The papers say
"Johnny won't you come back home?"
'Cause everybody knows you don't
Want to give yourself up, tell the truth
And God will save you
Gravity
Don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be
These pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, if we could run away
Run away from here
And though I know how much you hate this
Are you going to be the one to save us
From the black and hopeless feeling?
Will you mean it when the end comes reeling?
Hold your heart into this darkness
Will it ever be the light to shine you out
Or fail and leave you stranded?
I'm not going to be the one left standing
You aren't going to be the one left standing
We aren't going to be the ones left standing
Gravity
Don't mean too much to me
Is this our destiny?
This world is after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, run away, run away
Run away from here
Yeah
Away from here
Away from here
The amount of pills I'm taking counteracts the booze I'm drinking
And this vanity I'm breaking lets me live my life like this
And well I find it hard to stay
With the words you say
Oh baby let me in
Oh baby let me in
Well I'll choose the life I've taken
Never mind the friends I'm making
And the beauty that I'm faking
Lets me live my life like this
And well I find it hard to stay
With the words you say
Oh baby let me in
Oh baby let me in
And you can cry all you want to
I don't care how much
You invest yourself in me
We're not working out
We're not working out
And you can't touch my brother
And you can't keep my friends
We're not working out
And we're not working out
This time I mean it
Never mind the times I've seen it
Well I hope I'm not mistaken by the news I heard from waking
And it's hard to say I'm shaken by the choices that I make
And well I find it hard to stay
With the words you say.
Oh baby let me in
Oh baby let me in
Well I'll choose this life I've taken
Never mind the friends I'm making
And I get a little shaken
Because I live my life like this
And well I find it hard to stay
With the words you say
Oh baby let me in
Oh baby let me in
And you can cry all you want to
I don't care how much you'll invest yourself in me
We're not working out
We're not working out
And you can't keep my brother
And you won't fuck my friends
And we're not working out
We're not working out this time I mean it
Never mind the times I've seen it
Never again, never again.
You can cry all you want to
I don't care how much you'll invest yourself in me
Oh baby let me in
Now, come one, come all to this tragic affair
Wipe off that makeup, what's in is despair
So throw on the black dress, mix in with the lot
You might wake up and notice you're someone you're not
If you look in the mirror and don't like what you see
You can find out, first hand, what it's like to be me
So gather 'round, piggies, and kiss this goodbye
I'd encourage your smiles, I'll expect you won't cry
Another contusion, my funeral jag
Here's my resignation, I'll serve it in drag
You've got front row seats to the penitence ball
When I grow up, I want to be nothing at all!
I said yeah, yeah!
I said yeah, yeah!
Come on, come on, come on, I said
Save me! (Get me the hell out of here)
Save me! (Too young to die and, my dear)
You can't! (If you can hear me, just)
Save me! (Walk away)
There might be something outside your window
But you just never know
There could be something right past the turnpike gates
But you'll just never know
If my velocity starts to make you sweat
Then just don't let go
And if their heaven ain't got a vacancy
Then we just, then we just, then we just
Then we just get up and go!
Ladies and gentlemen
Truth is now acceptable
Fame is now injectable
Process the progress
This core is critical
Faith is unavailable
Lives become incredible
Now, please understand that
I can't slow down
I won't be waiting for you
I can't stop now
Because I'm dancing
This planet's ours to defend
Ain't got no time to pretend
Don't fuck around
This is our last chance
If my velocity starts to make you sweat
Then just don't let go
'Cause the emergency room got no vacancy
Then we just, then we just, then we just
Then we just get up and go!
(Who) they want you to be
(Who) they wanted to see
(Go) kill the party with me
And never go home
(Who) they want you to be
(Who) they wanted to see
Just leave the party with me
And never go home
You're unbelievable
Ah, so unbelievable
Ah, you ruin everything
Oh, you better go home
I'm unbelievable
Yeah, I'm undefeatable
Yeah, let's ruin everything
Blast it to the back row
They sell presentable
Young, and so ingestible
Sterile and collectible
Safe, and I can't stand it
This is a letter
My word is the berretta
The sound of my vendetta
Against the ones who planned it
If my velocity starts to make you sweat
Then just don't let go
'Cause the emergency room got no vacancy
Tell me, who do you trust, do you trust?
Then we just get up and go!
(Who) they want you to be
(Who) they wanted to see
(Go) kill the party with me
And never go home
(Who) they want you to be
(Who) they wanted to see
Just leave the party with me
And never go home
You keep eternity
Give us the radio
Deploy the battery
We're taking back control
Engage the energy
Light up the effigy
No chance to take it slow
By now I'm sure you
Know, know, know, know, know, know
(1, 2, 3, go!)
Get up and go!
(Who) they want you to be
(Who) they wanted to see
(Go) kill the party with me
And never go home
(Who) they want you to be
(Who) they wanted to see
Just leave the party with me
And never go home
Are we still having fun?
Are you holding the gun?
Take the money and run
We'll never go home
I've got nothing to lose
You've got nothing to say
And we're leaving today
We'll never go home
I think I'm gonna go now
I think I'm gonna go now
I think I better go now
Going to go now, going to go now
Going to go now, going to go now
Go now, going to go now
Go home!
Late dawns and early sunsets
Just like my favorite scenes
Then holding hands and life was perfect
Just like up on the screen
And the whole time while always giving
Counting your face among the living
Up and down escalators
Pennies and colder fountains
Elevators and half price sales
Trapped in by all these mountains
Running away and hiding with you
I never thought they'd get me here
Not knowing you changed from just one bite
I fought them all off just to hold you close and tight
But does anyone notice?
But does anyone care?
And if I had the guts
To put this to your head
But would anything matter
If you're already dead?
And should I be shocked now
By the last thing you said?
Before I pull this trigger
Your eyes vacant and stained
But does anyone notice?
But does anyone care?
And if I had the guts
To put this to your head
And would anything matter
If you're already dead?
And now should I be shocked
By the last thing you said?
Before I pull this trigger
Your eyes vacant and stained
And in saying you loved me
Made things harder at best
And these words changing nothing
As your body remains
And there's no room in this hell
There's no room in the next
And our memories defeat us
And I'll end this direst
But does anyone notice?
But does anyone care?
Well if I had the guts
To put this to your head
But does anything matter
If you're already dead?
And should I be shocked now
By the last thing you said?
Before I pull this trigger
Your eyes vacant and stained
And it's saying you loved me
Made things harder at best
And these words changing
Nothing as your body remains
And there's no room in this hell
There's no room in the next
But does anyone notice
There's a corpse in this bed
Without a sound I took her down
And dressed in red and blue I squeezed
Imaginary wedding gown
That you can't wear in front of me
A kiss goodbye
Your twisted shell
As rice grains and roses fall at your feet
We'll say goodbye
The hundredth time
And then tomorrow we'll do it again
Tomorrow we'll do it again
I dragged her down
I put her out
And back there I left her where no one could see
And lifeless, cold
Into this well
I stared as this moment was held for me
A kiss goodbye
Your twisted shell
As rice grains and roses fall at your feet
Say goodbye
The hundredth time
And then tomorrow we'll do it again
I never thought it'd be this way
Just me and you we're here alone
And if you say
All I'm asking for is
A thousand bodies piled up
I never thought would be enough
To show you just what I've been thinking
And I'll keep on making more
Just to prove that I adore
Every inch of sanity
All I'm asking for is...
All I'm asking for is...
These hands, stained red
From the times that I've killed you and then
We can wash down this engagement ring
With poison and kerosene
We'll laugh, as we die
And we'll celebrate the end of things with cheap champagne
Without...
Without a sound
Without...
Without a sound
And I wish you away.
Without a sound
And I wish you away.
Without a sound, without a sound
And I wish you away
Without a sound, without a sound
And I wish you away
Without a sound, without a sound
And I wish you away.
Drugs, gimme drugs, gimme drugs
I don't need it, but I'll sell what you got
Take the cash and I'll keep it
Eight legs to the wall
Hit the gas, kill them all
And we crawl, and we crawl, and we crawl
You be my detonator
Love, gimme love, gimme love
I don't need it, but I'll take what I want from your heart
And I'll keep it in a bag, in a box
Put an X on the floor
Gimme more, gimme more, gimme more
Shut up and sing it with me
(Na na na...)
From mall security
To every enemy
We're on your property
Standing in V formation
(Na na na...)
Let's blow an artery
Eat plastic surgery
Keep your apology
Give us more detonation
(More! Gimme more! Gimme more!)
Oh, let me tell you 'bout the sad man
Shut up and let me see your jazz hands
Remember when you were a madman
Thought you was Batman
And hit the party with a gas can
Kiss me you animal
(Na na na...)
You run the company
Fuck like a Kennedy
I think we'd rather be
Burning your information
(Na na na...)
Let's blow an artery
Eat plastic surgery
Keep your apology
Give us more detonation
And right here
Right now
All the way in Battery City
The little children
Raise their open filthy palms
Like tiny daggers up to heaven
And all the juvee halls
And the Ritalin rats
Ask angels made from neon
And fucking garbage
Scream out, "What will save us?"
And the sky opened up
Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one, no one wants to die
Wanna try, wanna try, wanna try
Wanna try, wanna try, now
I'll be your detonator
(Na na na...)
Make no apology
It's death or victory
On my authority
Crash and burn
Young and loaded
Drop like a bullet shell
Dress like a sleeper cell
I'd rather go to hell
Than be in purgatory
Cut my hair
Gag and bore me
Pull this pin
Let this world explode
Gonna take off all my skin
Tear apart all of my insides
When they rifle in
Mom and Dad think you'll be saved
They never had the time
They gonna medicate your lies
You were always born a crime
We salute you in your grave
Can't find my way home
but it's through you and I know
What I'd do
Just to get back in her arms
Can't find my way home
but it's through you and I know
What I'd do
Just to get back in her
My gun, fires seven different shades of shit
So what's your favorite color, punk?
Do you wanna hold my hand
Could you sign this photograph
'Cause I'm your biggest fan
Would you leave me lyin' here?
Well not I'm here to pay a compliment
Or sing about the government
Oxycontin genocide
Adolescent suicide
Give me my sincerity
Don't give a fuck about a Kennedy
Here's what I got to say:
Can't find my way home
but it's through you and I know
What I'd do
Just to get back in her arms
Can't find my way home
but it's through you and I know
What I'd do
Just to get back in her
Can't find my way home
but it's through you and I know
What I'd do
Just to get back in her arms
Can't find my way home
but it's through you and I know
What I'd do
Just to get back in her arms
Can't find the way
Can't find the way
Can't find the way
Can't find the way
C'mon, Angel, don't you cry
C'mon, Angel, don't you cry
C'mon, Angel, don't you cry
C'mon, Angel, don't you cry
We could be perfect one last night
And die like star crossed lovers when we fight
And we could settle this affair
If you would shed your yellow
Take my hand and then
We'll solve
The mystery of laceration gravity
This riddle
Of revenge
Please understand that it has to be this way
Stand!
Up fucking tall, don't let them see your back
And take!
My fucking hand
And never be afraid again
We've only got one chance to put things at an end
And cross the patron saint of switchblade fights
You said, we're not celebrities
We spark and fade, they die by threes
I'll make you
Understand
And you can trade me for an apparition
Stand up fucking tall
Don't let them see your back
And take my fucking hand
And never...
Trust
You said
Who put the words in your head?
Oh how wrong we were to think that immortality meant never dying
Stand...
Take my fucking hand...
Take my fucking...
Stand up fucking tall, don't let them see your back
Take
My fucking hand
And never be afraid again
Just because my hand's around your throat!
He calls the mansion not a house but a tomb
He's always choking from the stench and the fume
The wedding party all collapsed in the room
So send my resignation to the bride and the groom
Let's go down!
This elevator only goes up to ten
He's not around, he's always looking at men
Down by the pool he doesn't have many friends
As they are
Face down and bloated, snap a shot with the lens
If you marry me
Would you bury me?
Would you carry me to the end?
(Say goodbye) to the vows you take
(And say goodbye) to the life you make
(And say goodbye) to the hearts you break
And all the cyanide you drank
She keeps a picture of the body she lends
Got nasty blisters from the money she spends
She's got a life of her own and it shows by the Benz
She drives at 90 by the Barbies and Kens
If you ever say never too late
I'll forget all the diamonds you ate
Lost in coma and covered in cake
Increase the medication
Share the vows at the wake
(Kiss the bride) If you marry me
Would you bury me?
Would you carry me to the end?
(Say goodbye) to the vows you take
(And say goodbye) to the life you make
(And say goodbye) to the hearts you break
And all the cyanide you drank
(And say goodbye) to the last parade
(And walk away) from the choice you made
(And say goodnight) to the hearts you break
And all the cyanide you drank
(Say goodbye) to the vows you take
(And say goodbye) to the life you make
(And say goodbye) to the hearts you break
And all the cyanide you drank
(And say goodbye) to the last parade
(And walk away) from the choice you made
(And say goodnight) to the hearts you break
And all the cyanide you drank
To the last parade
And the parties fade
And the choice you made
To the end
These are the eyes and the lies of the taken
These are their hearts but their hearts don't beat like ours
They burn 'cause they are all afraid
For everyone of us, there's an army of them
But you'll never fight alone
'Cause I wanted you to know
That the world is ugly
But you're beautiful to me
Well are you thinking of me now? (now)
These are the nights and the lights that we fade in
These are the words, but the words aren't coming out
They burn 'cause they are hard to say
For every failing sun, there's a morning after
Though I'm empty when you go
I just wanted you to know
That the world is ugly
But you're beautiful to me
Are you thinking of me?
Like I'm thinking of you?
I would say I'm sorry though
Though I really need to go
I just wanted you to know
I wanted you to know
I wanted you to know
I'm thinking of you every night, every day
These are the lies and the lives of the taken
These are their hearts but their hearts don't beat like ours
They burn 'cause they are all afraid
But mine beats twice as hard
'Cause the world is ugly
But you're beautiful to me
Are you thinking of me?
Like I'm thinking of you?
I would say I'm sorry though
Though I really need to go
And I just wanted you to know
That the world is ugly (I just wanted you to know)
But you're beautiful to me (I just wanted you to know)
Are you thinking of me?
Stop your crying
Helpless feeling
Dry your eyes and start believing
There's one thing they'll never take from you
(And then your face, will never be the same
Never, forever
Like ghosts in the snow, like ghosts in the sun)
Are you all ready where you are?
Are you all ready where you are?
Are you all ready where you are?
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
(Right now!)
I hope you're ready for a firefight
'Cause the devil's got your number tonight
(They say!)
"We're never leaving this place alive"
But if you sing these words, we'll never die
Get off the ledge and drop the knife
Not a victim of a victim's life
Because this ain't a room full of suicides
We're believers, I believe tonight
We can leave this world, leave it all behind
We can steal this car if your folks don't mind
We can live forever
If you've got the time
Na na na na na
Na na na na na (If you save yourself tonight)
Na na na na na
Na na na na na (If you save yourself tonight)
I'll tell you all how the story ends
Where the good guys die and the bad guys win
(Who cares?)
This ain't about all the friends you made
But the graffiti they write on your grave
For all of us who've seen the light
Salute the dead and lead the fight (Hail, hail!)
Who gives a damn if we lose the war?
Let the walls come down, let the engines roar
We can leave this world, leave it all behind
We can steal this car if your folks don't mind
We can live forever
If you've got the time (Whoa!)
I'm the only friend that makes you cry
You're a heart attack in black hair dye
So just save yourself and
I'll hold them back tonight
Are y'all ready where you are at?
If you save yourself tonight ('Cause we're coming for you)
Can you save yourself tonight?
Right now! 'Cause I'll hold them back!
We can leave this world, leave it all behind
We can steal this car if your folks don't mind
We can live forever
If you've got the time (You motherfucker! Whoa!)
You're the broken glass in the morning light
Be a burning star if it takes all night
So just save yourself and
I'll hold them back tonight
Na na na na na
Na na na na na (If you save yourself tonight)
Na na na na na
Na na na na na (Can you save yourself tonight?)
Look alive, Sunshine
109 in the sky, but the pigs won't quit
You're here with me
Dr. Death-Defying
I'll be your surgeon, your proctor
Your helicopter
Pumpin' out the slaughtermatic sounds to keep you alive
A system failure for the masses
Anti-matter for the master plan
Louder than God's revolver & twice as shiny
This one's for all of you rock'n'rollers
All you crash queens & motor babies
Listen up
Well, they encourage your complete cooperation
Send you roses when they think you need to smile
I can't control myself because I don't know how
And they love me for it honestly, I'll be here for a while
So give them blood, blood, gallons of the stuff
Give them all that they can drink and it will never be enough
So give them blood, blood, blood
Grab a glass because there's going to be a flood
A celebrated man amongst the gurneys
They can fix me proper with a bit of luck
The doctors and the nurses they adore me so
But it's really quite alarming 'cause I'm such an awful fuck
(Oh, thank you)
I gave you blood, blood, gallons of the stuff
I gave you all that you can drink and it has never been enough
I gave you blood, blood, blood
I'm the kind of human wreckage that you love
Make room
Make room
Down on the coffin there's a coffin or two
Dead chique
So cool
The cannibals are starving when they're looking at you
Tank tops
Jet stream
Karate lessons with the killing machine
White lines
Nose bleeds
I know you get excited when the cameras go ra-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat
Me, you and all of these living dead
Burning up in the sun. Where the bodies at?
Sitting here with you in misery
Anybody gonna come and rescue me?
Oh
Woah
Make room
Make room
One day you're gonna have explaining to do
Drag star
So cool
There's only room for one and neither one is you you you
Me, you and all of these living dead
Burning up in the sun. Where the bodies at?
Got a taste for the cash and androgyny
Anybody wanna come and rescue me?
All right, oh
Well, all right
Well, all right
Well, all right
Well, all right
Well, all right
Well, all right
Well, all right
She's all right
Everybody in the room is alright
Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one
No one wants to die
Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one
No one wants to die
Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one
No one wants to die
We're never gonna change the world
We're never gonna change the world
'Cause we are never gonna die
Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one
No one wants to die
Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one
No one wants to die
Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one
No one wants to die
Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one
No one wants to die
Make room!
Hear the sound
The angels come screaming
Down your voice
I hear you've been bleeding
Make your choice
They say you've been pleading
"Someone save us"
Heaven help us now
Come crashing down
We'll hear the sound
as you're falling down
I'm at this old hotel
but can't tell if I've been breathing or sleeping
or screaming or waiting for the man to call
and maybe all of the above
'Cause mostly I've been sprawled on these cathedral steps
while spitting out the blood and screaming
"Someone save us"
Heaven help us now
Come crashing down
We'll hear the sound
as you're falling down
And will you pray for me?
Or make a saint of me?
And will you lay for me?
Or make saint?
'Cause I'll give you all the nails you need
Cover me in gasoline
Wipe away those tears of blood again
and the punchline to the joke is asking
"Someone save us"
Heaven help us now
Come crashing down
We'll hear the sound
as you fall
And would you pray for me?
(You don't know a thing about my sins)
(How the misery begins)
Or make a saint of me?
(You don't know)
(So I'm burning, I'm burning)
And will you lay for me?
(You don't know a thing about my sins)
(How the misery begins)
Or make a saint?
(You don't know)
('Cause I'm burning, I'm burning)
'Cause I'll give you all the nails you need
(I'm burning, I'm burning again)
Cover me in gasoline again

(higher oh!12x)
Saints protect her now,
Come angels of the Lord
Come angels of the Lord
So give me all you've got
I can take it
We walked alone in your city lights
Did you make it?
We lit the fire and it's burning bright
Did you take it?
Kissed all the boys in your city lights
Did you make it?
Left all the stars in your city nights
Can you fake it?
I lost my way in your city lights
glad you made it
We stole the fire
And it's burning bright
So give me all you've got
I can take it
We walked around in your city lights
'Cause it makes me who I am
We lit the fire
And it's burning bright
Not ashamed of what I am
I took the pills
for these empty nights
'Cause it makes me who I am
They always told me that
"You never get to heaven"
With a love like yours
Well if you're lost little boy
The cameras pull you right back down, yeah
It's like a chemical burn
I'm peeling off your skin, yeah
And when you see your face
Well you'll never be the same again, yeah
Cause if you just stop breathing
All stop, stop my heart
I'll stop breathing too
So give me all you've got
I can take it
We walked around in your city lights
'Cause it makes me who I am
We lit the fire
And it's burning bright
Not ashamed of what I am
I'd trade the world for your city nights
'Cause it makes me who I am
And it makes me who I am
And it makes me who I am
And though I missed the chance for this
I confess that I can't wait
Until it's gone
No I mean this every single day
dont go if you got more to say
'Cause the world don't need
Another hopeless cause
Though it makes me who I am
'Cause it makes me who I am
And you made me who I am
And you made me who I am
Be afraid of what I am
I can take it
We walked around in your city lights
'Cause it makes me who I am
i burned it all but im doing fine
'Cause I'll never fade away
if i steal the fight from your city nights
'Cause it makes me who I am
Who I am
Remember me
Remember me
Remember me
Remember me
Where, where will you stand
When all the lights go out
Across these city streets?
Where were you when
All of the embers fell?
I still remember them
Covered in ash
Covered in glass
Covered in all my friends
I still think of the bombs they built
If there's a place that I could be
Then I'd be another memory
Can I be the only hope for you?
Because you're the only hope for me
And if we can't find where we belong
We'll have to make it on our own
Face all the pain and take it on
Because the only hope for me is you alone
How would you be
Many years after the disasters
That we've seen?
What have we learned
Other than people burn in
Purifying flame?
I'll say it's okay
I know you can tell
And though you can see me smile
I still think of the guns they sell
If there's a place that I could be
Then I'd be another memory
Can I be the only hope for you?
Because you're the only hope for me
And if we can't find where we belong
We'll have to make it on our own
Face all the pain and take it on
Because the only hope for me is you alone
The only hope for me
The only hope for me is you
The only hope for me is you
The only hope for me is you
The only hope for me is you
The only hope is!
If there's a place that I could be
Then I'd be another memory
Can I be the only hope for you?
Because you're the only hope for me
And if we can't find where we belong
We'll have to make it on our own
Face all the pain and take it on
Because the only hope for me is you alone
Yeah!
Well let's go back to the middle of the day that starts it all
I can't begin to let you know just what I'm feeling
And now the red ones make me fly
And the blue ones help me fall
And I think I'll blow my brains against the ceiling
And as the fragments of my skull begin to fall
Fall on your tongue like pixie dust just think happy thoughts
And we'll fly home
We'll fly home
You and I
We'll fly home
Come on!
Well now I'm back in the middle of the day that starts it all.
I can't begin to let you know just what I'm feeling.
And now these red ones make me fly,
And the blue ones help me fall.
And I think I'll blow my brains against the ceiling.
And we'll fly home,
You and I,
We'll fly home.
Now honestly that's what I said to her, what I said to her
Think happy thoughts
Think happy thoughts
Think happy thoughts
Think happy thoughts
Think happy thoughts
Think happy thoughts
Think happy thoughts
Think happy thoughts
Think ha... wooo!
We hold in our hearts
the sword and the faith
Swelled up from the rain clouds
Move like a wraith
Well after all, we'll lie another day
And through it all, we'll find some other way
To carry on through cartilage and fluid
And did you come to stare or wash away the blood?
Well tonight, well tonight will it ever come?
Spend the rest of your days rockin' out
Just for the dead
Well tonight, will it ever come?
I can see you awake anytime in my head
Did we all fall down?
Did we all fall down?
Did we all fall down?
Did we all fall down?
From the lights to the pavement
From the van to the floor
From backstage to the doctor
From the earth to the morgue
Morgue, morgue, morgue!
Well tonight, will it ever come?
Spend the rest of your days rockin' out just for the dead
Well tonight, will it ever come?
I can see you awake anytime in my head
All fall down, well after all...
Well it rains and it pours
When you're out on your own
If I crash on the couch
Can I sleep in my clothes?
'Cause I've spent the night dancing
I'm drunk, I suppose
If it looks like I'm laughing
I'm really just asking to leave
This alone, you're in time for the show
You're the one that I need
I'm the one that you loathe
You can watch me corrode like a beast in repose
'Cause I love all the poison
Away with the boys in the band
I've really been on a bender and it shows
So why don't you blow me a kiss before she goes?
Give me a shot to remember
And you can take all the pain away from me
A kiss and I will surrender
The sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead
A light to burn all the empires
So bright the sun is ashamed to rise and be
In love with all of these vampires
So you can leave like the sane abandoned me
There's a place in the dark where the animals go
You can take off your skin in the cannibal glow
Juliet loves the beat and the lust it commands
Drop the dagger and lather the blood on your hands, Romeo
I've really been on a bender and it shows
So why don't you blow me a kiss before she goes?
Give me a shot to remember
And you can take all the pain away from me
A kiss and I will surrender
The sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead
A light to burn all the empires
So bright the sun is ashamed to rise and be
In love with all of these vampires
So you can leave like the sane abandoned me
Give me a shot to remember
And you can take all the pain away from me
A kiss and I will surrender
The sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead
A light to burn all the empires
So bright the sun is ashamed to rise and be
In love with all of these vampires
So you can leave like the sane abandoned me
There might be something outside your window
But you just never know
There could be something right past the turnpike gates
But you'll just never know
If my velocity starts to make you sweat
Then just don't let go
And if their heaven ain't got a vacancy
Then we just, then we just, then we just
Then we just get up and go!
Ladies and gentlemen
Truth is now acceptable
Fame is now injectable
Process the progress
This core is critical
Faith is unavailable
Lives become incredible
Now, please understand that
I can't slow down
I won't be waiting for you
I can't stop now
Because I'm dancing
This planet's ours to defend
Ain't got no time to pretend
Don't fuck around
This is our last chance
If my velocity starts to make you sweat
Then just don't let go
'Cause the emergency room got no vacancy
Then we just, then we just, then we just
Then we just get up and go!
(Who) they want you to be
(Who) they wanted to see
(Go) kill the party with me
And never go home
(Who) they want you to be
(Who) they wanted to see
Just leave the party with me
And never go home
You're unbelievable
Ah, so unbelievable
Ah, you ruin everything
Oh, you better go home
I'm unbelievable
Yeah, I'm undefeatable
Yeah, let's ruin everything
Blast it to the back row
They sell presentable
Young, and so ingestible
Sterile and collectible
Safe, and I can't stand it
This is a letter
My word is the berretta
The sound of my vendetta
Against the ones who planned it
If my velocity starts to make you sweat
Then just don't let go
'Cause the emergency room got no vacancy
Tell me, who do you trust, do you trust?
Then we just get up and go!
(Who) they want you to be
(Who) they wanted to see
(Go) kill the party with me
And never go home
(Who) they want you to be
(Who) they wanted to see
Just leave the party with me
And never go home
You keep eternity
Give us the radio
Deploy the battery
We're taking back control
Engage the energy
Light up the effigy
No chance to take it slow
By now I'm sure you
Know, know, know, know, know, know
(1, 2, 3, go!)
Get up and go!
(Who) they want you to be
(Who) they wanted to see
(Go) kill the party with me
And never go home
(Who) they want you to be
(Who) they wanted to see
Just leave the party with me
And never go home
Are we still having fun?
Are you holding the gun?
Take the money and run
We'll never go home
I've got nothing to lose
You've got nothing to say
And we're leaving today
We'll never go home
I think I'm gonna go now
I think I'm gonna go now
I think I better go now
Going to go now, going to go now
Going to go now, going to go now
Go now, going to go now
Go home!
It was the worst thing that I'd ever done
It was a head shot
You know, you gave me the gun
Oh please, just hide me now
I won't tell a soul
It was the worst part
What we did to this little girl
Oh please, don't leave me now
Baby please, don't go away
Emily, you're far from home
And Emily, we'll figure if I could figure it out
We'll both never be afraid
Emily come home
It was the last time I saw her alive
Sometimes you do things you need to do to survive
Oh please, don't leave me now
I'll miss you so much
Oh please, don't go away
I'm needing your touch, but please don't leave me now
Baby, please don't go away
Emily, you're far from home
And Emily, we'll figure if I could figure it out
We'll both never be afraid
Emily, come home, come home, come home, come home
Now Emily, you're far from home
And Emily, we'll figure if I could figure it out
We'll both never be afraid
And Emily, come home
Now Emily come home
Now Emily come home
Now Emily come home
"I'd like to hear that, see if the tempo is good, ya know? Yeah, I wanna listen to it."
Yeah I drink juice when I'm killing cause it's fucking delicious
Hanging in the party down with Tommy Chong
When up came the day when karate was young
I got a medical emergency, medical emergency
We got a medical emergency, medical emergency
Switching up my style, bring a friend out with
Better grab your soul from the fingers of death
I got a medical emergency, medical emergency
We got a medical emergency, medical emergency
(Whoa)
(Whoa)
(Whoa)
(Whoa)
(1, 2, 3, 4)
(Bass!)
(1, 2, 3, 4)
Hanging in the party down with Tommy Chong
Take you to a time when karate was young
I got a medical emergency, medical emergency
We got a medical emergency, medical emergency
(Whoa)
(Whoa)
(Whoa)
(Whoa)
We got a medical emergency, medical emergency
Wait until it fades to black
Ride into the sunset
Would I lie to you?
Well I've got something to say
Grab your six-gun from your back
Throttle the ignition
Would I die for you?
Well here's your answer in spades
Shotgun sinners, wild-eyed jokers
Got you in my sights
Gun it while I'm holding on
After all is said and done
Climb out from the pine box
Well I'm asking you
Cause she's got nothing to say
The angels just cut out her tongue
Call her Black Mariah
Would I lie to you?
That girl's not right in the brain
Mass convulsions
Strike the choir
By the grace of God
Gun it while I'm holding on
But, don't stop
If I fall
And don't look back
Oh baby don't stop
Bury me and fade to black
She won't stop me, put it down
She won't stop me, put it down
She won't stop me, put it down
So get your gun and meet me by the door
She won't stop me, put it down
She won't stop me, put it down
She won't stop me, put it down
So get your gun and meet me by the door
She won't stop me, put it down
She won't stop me, put it down
She won't stop me, put it down
So get your gun and meet me by the door
She won't stop me, put it down
She won't stop me, put it down
She won't stop me, put it down
So baby
Don't stop
If I fall
And don't look back
Oh baby don't stop
Bury me and fade to black
Don't stop
If I fall
And don't look back
Oh baby don't stop
Bury me and fade to black and hang 'em high!!!
Go!
To un-explain the unforgivable
Drain all the blood and give the kids a show
By streetlight this dark night, a sance down below
Theres things that I have done you never should ever know!
And without you is how I disappear
And live my life alone forever now
And without you is how I disappear
And live my life alone forever now
Who walks among the famous living dead
Drowns all the boys and girls inside your bed
And if you could talk to me, tell me if it's so
That all the good girls go to heaven
Well, heaven knows
That without you is how I disappear
And live my life alone forever now
And without you is how I disappear
And live my life alone forever now
Can you hear me cry out to you?
Words I thought I'd choke on, figure out
I'm really not so with you anymore I'm just a ghost
So I can't hurt you anymore, so I can't hurt you anymore!
And now, you wanna see how far down I can sink?
Let me go, fuck!
So you can
Well now, so you can
I'm so far away from you
Well now, so you can
And without you is how I disappear
And without you is how I disappear
Whoa whoa
(And without you is how I disappear)
Whoa whoa
(And without you is how)
Forever
(Is how)
Forever now!
(Is how)
Everyone's a passenger tonight,
Just another accidental on the freeway of this life.
We'll drive on, and on, and on, and on.
We'll drive on, and on, and-
I'll remember this night when you're gone
You surrender your heart,
I surrender every dream,
Every weapon you've got,
Every secret that I keep,
You can fight this all you want,
But tonight belongs to-
Just another surgery tonight,
Well if you amputate the loneliness,
Anesthesia dims the lights.
So dream on, and on, and on, and on.
So dream on, and on, and-
I'll remember your eyes when you're gone
You surrender your heart,
I surrender every dream,
Every weapon you've got,
Every secret that I keep,
You can fight this all you want,
But tonight belongs to me
And I'll watch you in your sleep
'Cause tonight belongs to me
You can fight this all you want,
But tonight belongs to...
Sparks against the railing,
Distant phantoms wailing.
Through the windshield sailing,
With these airbags failing.
Now you surrender your heart,
I surrender every dream,
Every weapon you've got,
Every secret that I keep,
You can fight this all you want,
But tonight belongs to me
And I'll watch you in your sleep,
You can fight this all you want,
But tonight belongs to me,
But tonight belongs to me,
But tonight belongs to me.
For what you did to me
Or what I'll do to you
You get what everyone else gets
You get a lifetime
Let's go
Do you remember that day when we met, you told me this gets harder
Well it did
Been holding on forever
Promise me that when I'm gone you'll kill my enemies
The damage you've inflicted
Temporary wounds
I'm coming back from the dead
And I'll take you home with me
I'm taking back the life you stole
We never got that far
This helps me to think all through the night
Bright lights that won't kill me now
Or tell me how
Just you and I your starless eyes remain
Hip hip hooray for me
You talk to me
But would you kill me in my sleep
Lay still like the dead
From the razor to the rosary
We could lose ourselves and paint these walls in pitchfork red
I will avenge my ghost with every breath I take
I'm coming back from the dead
And I'll take you home with me
I'm taking back the life you stole
This hole you put me in
Wasn't deep enough and I'm climbing out right now
You're running out of places
To hide from me
When you go, just know that I will remember you
If living was the hardest part, we'll then one day be together
And in the end we'll fall apart, just as the leaves change in color
And then I will be with you, I will be there one last time now
When you go, just know that I will remember you
I've lost my fear of falling
I will be with you
I will be with you
Well if you wanted honesty, that's all you had to say.
I never want to let you down or have you go, it's better off this way.
For all the dirty looks, the photographs your boyfriend took,
Remember when you broke your foot from jumping out the second floor?
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out
What will it take to show you that it's not the life it seems?
(I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again you sing the words but don't know what it means
(I'm not okay)
To be a joke and look, another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook for the last time take a good hard look!
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out
Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you read me like a book, but the pages all are torn and frayed
I'm okay
I'm okay!
I'm okay, now
(I'm okay, now)
But you really need to listen to me
Because I'm telling you the truth
I mean this, I'm okay!
(Trust Me)
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
Well, I'm not okay
I'm not o-fucking-kay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
(Okay)

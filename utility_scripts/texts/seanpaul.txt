Sean Paul, Rahzel
Number one champion

It's the return of the microphone fiend
I be the first nigga to split ya spleen
Impair ya vision, leave ya cataract split screen
You'll be assed out, passed out like Mitch Green

Fight Club, from a Brad Pitt scene
I'm a SWAT team, spittin' the hot sixteen
A pimp's steen is makin' ya chick scream
Download my digital, digital voice stream

Automatic wide screen
Low rider, with them buggy eyed beams
A bad freak, in the back seat, named Ming Ling
Well, last week them bad streets was in full swing

For my brothers locked down in G.P. to Sing Sing
Sean Paul, a Dance hall king
The track like a puppet on a string

From a set a dem any time dem come arouna
Dem hole a dis dem a waan try fi take ya crowna
Dem waan fi see ya han a growna
But di badman a wears a crowna
Come a bun a dutty babylona

Yo becaw me see dem a plan a to try fi come tek over me zona
Say dem a try fi tek me ting like it now dem owna
Dem di kinda ting dat kinda a hurt me corizona
So me turn dem into organ donors

Escape an a bed to Barcelona with Fiona and Iona
Floakin' wit a pound of home growna
One a dem gal a rub pon my shoulder
One a pour a club soda, plus I like di flight controla
Tell dem

On top of the game I'll stay
(Number one)

Take this! 

[Chorus x2] 
Hot sexy Punkie, mi punkie 
(the right line here) Gal se nota que me quiere, me quiere 
No importa que tu man dice 
No quiere ser, una de esta días 
Sabes que te tengo que tener 

[Verse 1] YO! 

A veces me encuentro soñando de ti 
Y! 
Siento que no puedo resistir 
(the right line here) Muchas cosas desde hace tiempo quiero decir 
Como ese novio que tu tienes no te trata bien a ti 

Necesitas un hombre que te de pasión 
Que te ame con todo,(the right line here) que pierda el corazón 
La llave de una relación es comunicación 
Eres una bella dama, quieres una flor? 

[Chorus x2] 

Yo! 

Tengo a mi gal y lo sabes 
Y! 
(the right line here) Tu tienes tu man y yo lo se 
Eso no me para a mi de estar mirandote 
Quisiera tomar contigo copas de Alize

Que vamos (a) hacer con estos sentimientos 
Sean Paul es un tipo que nacio con talento
Quisiera besarte y tocar tu cuerpo lento 
Pero estoy esperando el correcto momento 

[Chorus x2] 

Y´all! 

Vamos a estar 
Inseparado 
Porque yo quiero que estés a mi lado 

Enamorado 
Y no lo sabes

[Chorus Yankee:]


Going back to the memories
Reminiscing 'bout you and me
Thinking how it used to be
It's plain and clear I treated you bad
But girl you know that I care
Every relationship have wear and tear
Just draw near girl and try to hear and listen what my heart says.

Many days and many nights
Many heartbreaks, many fights
Many wrongs but so many rights
So girl don't let this love die
Never meant to cause you no pain,
Girl I never meant to treat you lame.
Gimme one more chance rewind come back again.
Don't let this love die.

Just cry baby cry
(Don't cry no more)
Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines

Can you feel me reaching out to you girl, can you hear my open thoughts
Never want to disrespect you girl don't let this come break us apart.
'Cause I know I would die without you, my girl can you hear my broken heart.
It's calling out to the good times that we had back at the start.

Baby (Don't call me baby)
You know I need you in my life daily (You know you played me)
I was a player but now your love changed me (Dead wrong)
I'm going crazy (I'm gone)
Never thought losing you would be so hard

It's your turn to cry baby cry
(Don't cry no more)
Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines

So let go
And move on
What we were
Is now undone
My tears have all dried
It's your turn now to cry

You're losing your love and your trust for me girl
And you know, I would go to the ends of the world.
If you wanted,
Just like we started
Girl 'cause I don't want to fight no more.
Make it like it was before.

I'll tell you the truth
And you cried and I cried
Let's get back to the place
And that look in your eyes
Can you feel it inside?
No clouds on your skies
The sun is gonna shine

Chat to her Santana! 

Just Cry Baby Cry
(Don't cry no more)
Cause every tear that flows falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines [x2]

Are you with me, Baby!

[Verse 1] 
Try to tell you that I love you babygirl 
But it's all in vain (in vain, in vain)
Try to tell you that I be there for you 
When you call my name (my name, my name!)
If every little thing I try to do, it gon' cause you pain (pain, pain)
Then I might as well leave you girl and don't come back again 
Cause you know I can't pretend 
I tell you that I give you love straight to the end 
Bad mind a cut we off, them nah want we carispen' (correspond)

And babygirl a you deserve the best indeed 
Nuff a them a try fi cut my speed 
And that just keeps depressing me 
But nothing's gonna break my stride 
And babygirl a let me tell you this you are my pride 
If I don't get the chance to treat you right 
Might as well den take my life 

[Bridge] 
Have you ever buck a woman and you feel so close? 
That you can't do without 'er, think bout 'er de most 
Family and friend dem nuh stop from oppose 
Its like watering a rose that never will grow 
Time after time me a try prove my love 
Cah the bond that me feel got to be from up above 
None a them nuh waan fi see 
Now dem mek me waan fi grief 
They dont waan believe it, its from my heart... 

[Chorus] 

[Bridge 2] 
Yeeaaah.... 
Girl I wanna know (I wanna know)
Are you with me?... baby! 
And I wanna know (I wanna know)

Well I wanna know (I wanna know)
Are you with me?... baby! 
Then dont listen none a them fools 
Cause they don't understand 

[Verse 3] 
Try to tell you that I love you babygirl 
But it's all in vain (in vain, in vain)
Try to tell you that I be there for you 
When you call my name (my name, my name!) 
Every little thing I try to do, it gon' cause you pain (pain, pain)
Then I might as well leave you girl and don't come back again 
Cause you kno I can't pretend 
And babygirl this is driving me insane 
Bad mind a cut wi off, them nah want wi carispen' (correspond) 
They dont understand it, from my heart...

What you feel like? [x4]

Love her back because she love me
Picture up in my cell phone
Call her up when I get lonely
Hope she keeping her cell on
This girl, she got something about her I can't deny, aye
This girl, if she tells me to I'll be standing by, aye

But, what you don't know is
Once we get started, it will go on and on

And it won't stop till I see her love come down
And it won't stop till I'm in too deep I'll be lost in love
Nowhere to be found
And it won't stop till I hear her make that sound
Until she screaming out 'baby you're about to turn me out'
Oh no, we can't stop now

I'm about to feel her body
I'm about to feel her body
I'm about to feel her body
I'm about to feel her body

She'll be taking her clothes off
Once we get the gal right by me
Break her down till she doze off
This girl, should be up there with the stars in the sky, aye
This girl, she could send me on a permanent eye, aye
But what you don't know is
Once we get started it will go on and on

And it won't stop till I see her love come down
And it won't stop till I'm in too deep I'll be lost in love
Nowhere to be found
And it won't stop till I hear her make that sound
Until she screaming out 'baby you're about to turn me out'
Oh no, we can't stop now
Can't stop now
You're about to turn me out
You're about to turn
Watch your feet love

Talked up on this
Stepped up on this
Keep it real properly
No it ever means
You and I in twine
And in ever bliss
You and I combined
She a reminisce
Tops up on this
Give all the reminisce
See all the lonely nights
We got candy strips
I'm the landlord
To the premises
I am the king
Make her know
What a empress is
Jeanie me give you sex wishes
Flex with me
For the lifetime membership
So send her kids
Make remember this
No matter day from my calendar is

But what you don't know is
Once we get started it will go on and on

And it won't stop till I see her love come down
And it won't stop till I'm in too deep I'll be lost in love
Nowhere to be found
And it won't stop till I hear her make that sound
Until she screaming out 'baby you're about to turn me out'
Oh no, we can't stop now
Can't stop now
You're about to turn me out
You're, you're, you're about to turn

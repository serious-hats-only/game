The Lonesome Death Of Hattie Carroll
Bob Dylan William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll,
With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
At a Baltimore hotel society gath'rin',
And the cops were called in and his weapon took from him
As they rode him in custody down to the station,
And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder. But you who philosophize, disgrace and criticize all fears,
Take the rag away from your face, now ain't the time for
your tears. William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders,
And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was
snarling,
In a matter of minutes on bail was out walking. But you who philosophize, disgrace and criticize all fears,
Take the rag away from your face, now ain't the time for
your tears. Hattie Carroll was a maid of the kitchen.
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage,
And never sat once at the head of the table
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle.
And she never done nothing to William Zanzinger. But you who philosophize, disgrace and criticize all fears,
Take the rag away from your face, now ain't the time for
your tears. In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel,
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the
level
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and
persuaded,
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
Who just happened to be feelin' that way without warnin'.
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished, And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance,
William Zanzinger with a six-month sentence. Oh, but you who philosophize, disgrace and criticize all
fears,
Bury the rag deep in your face, for now's the time for your
tears. How many roads must a man walk down, before they call him a man
How many seas must a white dove sail, before she sleeps in the sand
How many times must the cannonballs fly, before they are forever banned
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind How many years can a mountain exist, before it is washed to the sea
how many years can some people exist, before they're allowed to be free
how many times can a man turn his head, pretending he just doesn't see
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind
How many times must a man look up,
before he can see the sky
How many years must one man have, before he can hear people cry
How many deaths will it take till he knows
too many people have died
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind Come gather around people, wherever you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth savin'
Then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changin'
Come writers and critics, who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide, the chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon, for the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'
For the loser now will be later to win For the times they are a-changin'
Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
The battle outside ragin'
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin'
Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
And don't criticize what you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command Your old road is rapidly aging Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
For the times they are a-changin'
The line it is drawn, the curse it is cast
The slow one now will later be fast
As the present now will later be past
The order is rapidly fadin'
And the first one now will later be last
For the times they are a-changin' May God bless and keep you always,
May your wishes all come true,
May you always do for others
And let others do for you.
May you build a ladder to the stars
And climb on every rung,
May you stay forever young,
Forever young, forever young,
May you stay forever young. May you grow up to be righteous,
May you grow up to be true,
May you always know the truth
And see the lights surrounding you.
May you always be courageous,
Stand upright and be strong,
May you stay forever young,
Forever young, forever young,
May you stay forever young. May your hands always be busy,
May your feet always be swift,
May you have a strong foundation
When the winds of changes shift.
May your heart always be joyful,
May your song always be sung,
May you stay forever young,
Forever young, forever young,
May you stay forever young. Mama, take this badge off of me
I can't use it anymore
It's getting dark, too dark to see
I'm feelin' like I'm knocking on Heaven's door Knock, knock, knocking on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on Heaven's door Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them any more
That long black cloud is coming down
I'm feelin' like I'm knocking on Heaven's door Knock, knock, knocking on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on Heaven's door, ooh yeah
Knock, knock, knocking on Heaven's door Pistol shots ring out in the ballroom night
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out, "My God, they've killed them all!"
Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see
And another man named Bello, movin' around mysteriously
"I didn't do it," he says, and he throws up his hands
"I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand.
I saw them leavin'," he says, and he stops
"One of us had better call up the cops"
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin'
In the hot New Jersey night Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that
In Paterson that's just the way things go
If you're black you might as well not show up on the street
'Less you wanna draw the heat Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin' around
He said, "I saw two men runnin' out, they looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates"
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said: "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead"
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him that he could identify the guilty men Four in the mornin' and they haul Rubin in
Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs
The wounded man looks up through his one dyin' eye
Says, "Wha'd you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy!"
Yes, here's the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
Rubin's in South America, fightin' for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
And the cops are puttin' the screws to him, lookin' for somebody to blame.
"Remember that murder that happened in a bar?"
"Remember you said you saw the getaway car?"
"You think you'd like to play ball with the law?"
"Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin' that night?"
"Don't forget that you are white" Arthur Dexter Bradley said:"I'm really not sure"
Cops said:"A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job and we're talkin' to your friend Bello
Now you don't wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
You'll be doin' society a favor
That sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver.
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder on him
He ain't no gentleman jim" Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much It's my work, he'd say, and I do it for pay
And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way
Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail
But then they took him to the jail house
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
And though they could not produce the gun
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed Rubin Carter was falsely tried
The crime was murder "one," guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
Where justice is a game Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell
That's the story of the Hurricane
But it won't be over till they clear his name And give him back the time he's done.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter, anyhow
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now
When your rooster crows at the breaks of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm traveling on Don't think twice, it's all right It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
That light I never knowed
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
But I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talking anyway So don't think twice, it's all right It ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
Like you never done before
It ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
I can't hear you any more
I'm a-thinking and a-wond'rin' walking down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul Don't think twice, it's all right So long honey, babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
Goodbye's too good a word, babe
So I'll just say fare thee well
I ain't saying you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time But don't think twice, it's all right Hey, Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning, I'll come following you Though I know that evening's empire
Has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping
My weariness amazes me
I'm branded on my feet I have no one to meet
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming
Hey, Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to Hey, Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning, I'll come following you
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
To be wandering I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade
Cast your dancing spell my way
I promise to go under it Hey, Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me In the jingle jangle morning, I'll come following you
Though you might hear laughing, spinning
Swinging madly across the sun
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escaping on the run And but for the sky, there are no fences facing
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow You're seeing that he's chasing
Hey, Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me In the jingle jangle morning, I'll come following you
Then take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow
Hey, Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning, I'll come following you Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'm not the one you need You say you're lookin' for someone
Who's never weak, but always strong
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong Someone to open each and every door
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe Go lightly from the ledge, babe
Go lightly on the ground
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'll only let you down You say you're lookin' for someone
Who'll promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you
Someone to close his heart Someone who will die for you and more
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe Go melt back in the night
Everything inside is made of stone
There's nothing in here moving
And anyway, I'm not alone You say you're lookin' for someone
Who'll pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
And to come each time you call A lover for your life and nothing more
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime
In your prime
Didn't you?
People call
Say, "Beware doll, you're bound to fall"
You thought they were all
Kiddin' you
You used to Laugh about Everybody that was Hangin' out Now you don't
Talk so loud
Now you don't
Seem so proud About having to be scrounging
Your next meal How does it feel How does it feel To be without a home Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
Ah, you've Gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get
Juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you're gonna
Have to get
Used to it
You say you never
Compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you
Realize
He's not selling any Alibis
As you stare into the vacuum
Of his eyes
And say
"Do you want to
Make a deal?"
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
Ah, you
Never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did
Tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't
Let other people
Get your
Kicks for you
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your
Diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a
Siamese cat
Ain't it hard
When you discover that
He really wasn't
Where it's at
After he took from you everything
He could steal?
How does it feel
How does it feel
To have on your own
No direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
Ah
Princess on the steeple and all the
Pretty people they're all drinkin', thinkin' that they
Got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts
But you'd better
Take your diamond ring
You'd better pawn it, babe
You used to be
So amused
At Napoleon in rags
And the language that he used
Go to him now
He calls you
You can't refuse
When you ain't got nothin'
You got
Nothin' to lose
You're invisible now
You got no secrets
To conceal
How does it feel
Ah, how does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone? They say everything can be replaced
Yet every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released They say every man needs protection
They say every man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above this wall
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released Standing next to me in this lonely crowd
Is a man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear him shout so loud
Crying out that he was framed
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released Oh, where have you been
My blue-eyed son?
And where have you been
My darling young one? I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I've walked and I crawled on six crooked highways
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard And it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall Oh, what did you see
My blue-eyed son?
And what did you see
My darling young one? I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children And it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall And what did you hear
My blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear
My darling young one? I heard the sound of the thunder that roared out a warning
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin'
I heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley And it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall Oh, what did you meet
My blue-eyed son?
And who did you meet
My darling young one? I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman, her body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded in hatred And it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall And what'll you do now
My blue-eyed son?
And what'll you do now
My darling young one? I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where their home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, where none is the number
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it
And reflect from the mountains so all souls can see it
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'
But I'll know my song well before I start singing
And it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall Early one morning, the sun was shining
I was laying in bed
Wondering if she'd changed it all
If her hair was still red
Her folks, they said our lives together
Sure was gonna be rough
They never did like mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
And I was standing on the side of the road
Rain falling on my shoes
Heading out for the east coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues getting through
Tangled up in blue She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess
But I used a little too much force
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out west
Split up on a dark, sad night
Both agreeing it was best
She turned around to look at me
As I was walking away
I heard her say over my shoulder
"We'll meet again someday on the avenue" Tangled up in blue I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the axe just fell
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I's lucky for to be employed
Working for a while on a fishing boat
Right outside of Delacroix
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind
I seen a lot of women But she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Tangled up in blue She was working in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the sight of her face
In the spotlight so clear
And later on when the crowd thinned out
I's just about to do the same
She was standing there in back of my chair
Said, "Tell me, don't I know your name?"
I muttered something underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe
Tangled up in blue She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said
"You look like the silent type"
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true And glowed like burning coal
Pouring off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you
Tangled up in blue I lived with them on Montagüe Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafés at night
And revolution in the air
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside And when finally the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue So now I'm going back again
I got to get her somehow
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives
Don't know how it all got started
I don't what they do with their lives
But me, I'm still on the road
Heading for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point of view
Tangled up in blue Headed down south to the land of the pines
And I'm thumbin' my way into North Caroline
Starin' up the road
And pray to God I see headlights I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Pickin' me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a hopin' for Raleigh
I can see my baby tonight So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama anyway you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south-bound train
Hey mama rock me Runnin' from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old-time stringband
My baby plays the guitar
I pick a banjo now Oh, the North country winters keep a gettin' me now
Lost my money playin' poker so I had to up and leave
But I ain't a turnin' back
To livin' that old life no more So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama anyway you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south-bound train
Hey mama rock me Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly
Had a nice long toke
But he's a headed west from the Cumberland Gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee And I gotta get a move on fit for the sun
I hear my baby callin' my name
And I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh
At least I will die free So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama anyway you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south-bound train
Hey mama rock me Come, you masters of war
You that build the big guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it's your little toy You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you sit back and watch
While the death count gets higher You hide in your mansion
While the young peoples' blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud You've thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world For threatenin' my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins How much do I know
To talk out of turn?
You might say that I'm young
You might say I'm unlearned But there's one thing I know
Though I'm younger than you
That even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good?
Will it buy you forgiveness?
Do you think that it could? I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul And I hope that you die
And your death will come soon
I'll follow your casket
On a pale afternoon I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I'll stand over your grave
'Til I'm sure that you're dead You got a lotta nerve
To say you are my friend
When I was down
You just stood there grinning You got a lotta nerve
To say you got a helping hand to lend
You just want to be on
The side that's winning You say I let you down
You know it's not like that
If you're so hurt
Why then don't you show it? You say you lost your faith
But that's not where it's at
You had no faith to lose
And you know it I know the reason
That you talk behind my back
I used to be among the crowd
You're in with Do you take me for such a fool
To think I'd make contact
With the one who tries to hide
What he don't know to begin with? You see me on the street
You always act surprised
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck"
But you don't mean it When you know as well as me
You'd rather see me paralyzed
Why don't you just come out once
And scream it? No, I do not feel that good
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief
Perhaps I'd rob them And now I know you're dissatisfied
With your position and your place
Don't you understand
It's not my problem? I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment
I could be you Yes, I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
You'd know what a drag it is
To see you A worried man with a worried mind
No one in front of me and nothing behind
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes
I'm looking up into the sapphire tinted skies
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose
Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose
People are crazy and times are strange
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range
I used to care, but things have changed
This place ain't doing me any good
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move
Gonna take dancing lessons do the jitterbug rag
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag
Only a fool in here would think he's got anything to prove
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too
Don't get up gentlemen, I'm only passing through
People are crazy and times are strange
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range
I used to care, but things have changed
I've been walking forty miles of bad road
If the bible is right, the world will explode
I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can
Some things are too hot to touch
The human mind can only stand so much
You can't win with a losing hand
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet
Putting her in a wheel barrow and wheeling her down the street
People are crazy and times are strange
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range
I used to care, but things have changed
I hurt easy, I just don't show it
You can hurt someone and not even know it
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity
Gonna get lowdown, gonna fly high
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie
I'm love with a woman who don't even appeal to me
Mr. Jinx and Miss Lucy, they jumped in the lake
I'm not that eager to make a mistake
People are crazy and times are strange
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range
I used to care, but things have changed Crimson flames tied through my ears
Rollin' high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flaming roads
Using ideas as my maps
"We'll meet on edges, soon," said I
Proud 'neath heated brow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now. Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
"Rip down all hate," I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers
Foundationed deep, somehow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now. Girl's faces formed the forward path
From phony jealousy
To memorizing politics
Of ancient history
Flung down by corpse evangelists
Unthought of, though, somehow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now. A self-ordained professor's tongue
Too serious to fool
Spouted out that liberty
Is just equality in school
"Equality," I spoke the word
As if a wedding vow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now. In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
My existence led by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now. Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now. How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
How many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, and how many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they're forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind Yes, how many years can a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea?
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind The answer is blowing in the wind Yes, how many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Whatever colors you have in your mind
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile
Until the break of day, let me see you make him smile
His clothes are dirty but his, his hands are clean
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile
Why wait any longer for the world to begin
You can have your cake and eat it too
Why wait any longer for the one you love
When he's standing in front of you
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead
I long to see you in the morning light
I long to reach for you in the night
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead Johnny's in the basement
Mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement
Thinkin' about the government
The man in the trench coat
Badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough
Wants to get it paid off Look out kid
It's somethin' you did
God knows when
But you're doin' it again
You better duck down the alley way
Lookin' for a new friend
The man in the coon-skin cap
In the pig pen
Wants eleven dollar bills
You only got ten Maggie comes fleet foot
Face full of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put
Plants in the bed but
The phone's tapped anyway
Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the D.A. Look out kid
Don't matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes
Don't tie no bows
Better stay away from those
That carry 'round a fire hose
Keep a clean nose
Watch the plain clothes
You don't need a weather man
To know which way the wind blows Ah, get sick, get well
Hang around an ink well
Ring bell, hard to tell
If anything is goin' to sell
Try hard, get barred
Get back, write Braille
Get jailed, jump bail
Join the army, if you fail Look out kid
You're gonna get hit
By losers, cheaters
Six-time users
Hangin' 'round the theaters
Girl by the whirlpools
Lookin' for a new fool
Don't follow leaders
Watch the parkin' meters Ah, get born, keep warm
Short pants, romance, learn to dance
Get dressed, get blessed
Try to be a success
Please her, please him, buy gifts
Don't steal, don't lift
Twenty years of schoolin'
And they put you on the day shift Look out kid
They keep it all hid
Better jump down a manhole
Light yourself a candle
Don't wear sandals
Try to avoid the scandals
Don't wanna be a bum
You better chew gum
The pump don't work
'Cause the vandals took the handles If I had wings like noah's dove
I'd fly up the river to the one I love
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well If I met your man, who was long and tall
I'd hit his body like a cannon ball
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well One of these days and it won't be long
Call my name and I'll be gone
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well I remember one night, a drizzling rain
Round my heart I felt an achin' pain
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well When I wore my apron low
Couldn't keep you from my do'
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well Now I wear my apron high
Scarcely ever see you passing by
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well Now my apron's up to my chin
You pass my door and you won't come in
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well If I had listened to what my mama said
I'd be at home in my mama's bed
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well Mama, take this badge off o' me
I can't use it anymore
It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
I feel I'm knockin' on Heaven's door Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door Mama, put that gun to the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
There's a long black cloud is comin' down
I feel I'm knockin' on Heaven's door Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door 'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood
When blackness was a virtue the road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm" And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word
In a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm.
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm" Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm" I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes an' blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm" Suddenly I turned around and she was standin' there
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm" Now there's a wall between us, somethin' there's been lost
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm" Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm" I've heard newborn babies wailin' like a mournin' dove
And old men with broken teeth stranded without love
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm" In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation an' she gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"
Well, I'm livin' in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm" Darkness at the break of noon
Shadows even the silver spoon
The handmade blade, the child's balloon
Eclipses both the sun and moon
To understand you know too soon, there is no sense in trying Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Suicide remarks are torn
From the fool's gold mouthpiece the hollow horn
Plays wasted words proves to warn
That he not busy being born is busy dying Temptation's page flies out the door
You follow, find yourself at war
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
You feel to moan but unlike before
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying So don't fear if you hear
A foreign sound to your ear
It's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing As some warn victory, some downfall
Private reasons great or small
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
While others say don't hate nothing at all, except hatred Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As human gods aim for their mark
Made everything from toy guns that spark
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred Our preachers preach of evil fates
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
Goodness hides behind its gates
But even the President of the United States
Sometimes must have to stand naked An' all the rules of the road have been lodged
It's only people's games that you got to dodge
And it's alright, Ma, I can make it Advertising signs that con you
Into thinking you're the one
That can do what's never been done
That can win what's never been won
Meantime life outside goes on all around you You lose yourself, you reappear
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Alone you stand with nobody near
When a trembling distant voice, unclear
Startles your sleeping ears to hear
That somebody thinks they really found you A question in your nerves is lit
Yet you know there is no answer fit
To satisfy insure you not to quit
To keep it in your mind and not forget
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to Although the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools
I got nothing, Ma, to live up to For them that must obey authority
That they do not respect in any degree
Who despise their jobs, their destinies
Speak jealously of them that are free
Do what they do just to be
Nothing more than something they invest in While some on principles baptized
To strict party platform ties
Social clubs in drag disguise
Outsiders they can freely criticize
Tell nothing except who to idolize and say, "God bless him" While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gargles in the rat race choir
Bent out of shape from society's pliers
Cares not to come up any higher
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in But I mean no harm nor put fault
On anyone that lives in a vault
But it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him Old lady judges watch people in pairs
Limited in sex, they dare
To push fake morals, insult and stare
While money doesn't talk, it swears
Obscenity, who really cares propaganda, all is phony While them that defend what they cannot see
With a killer's pride, security
It blows the minds most bitterly
For them that think death's honesty
Won't fall upon them naturally
Life sometimes must get lonely My eyes collide head-on with stuffed graveyards
False goals, I scuff at pettiness which plays so rough
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs
Kick my legs to crash it off
Say, "Okay, I have had enough, what else can you show me?" And if my thought dreams could be seen
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only There must be some way out of here
Said the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth No reason to get excited
The thief, he kindly spoke There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants, too
Outside in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind began to howl Clouds so swift
Rain won't lift
Gate won't close
Railings froze
Get your mind off wintertime
You ain't goin' nowhere
Whoo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair! I don't care
How many letters they sent
Morning came and morning went
Pick up your money
And pack up your tent
You ain't goin' nowhere
Whoo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair! Buy me a flute
And a gun that shoots
Tailgates and substitutes
Strap yourself
To the tree with roots
You ain't goin' nowhere
Whoo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair! Genghis Khan
He could not keep
All his kings
Supplied with sleep
We'll climb that hill no matter how steep
When we get up to it
Whoo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow's the day
My bride's gonna come
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair! Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls She takes just like a woman
Yes, she does, she makes love just like a woman
Yes, she does, and she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl Queen Mary, she's my friend
Yes, I believe I'll go see her again
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
'Til she finally sees that she's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls She takes just like a woman
Yes, she makes love just like a woman
Yes, she does, and she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl It was raining from the first
And I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts
But what's worse is this pain in here
I can't stay in here
Ain't it clear that I just can't fit
Yes, I believe that it's time for us to quit
But when we meet again, introduced as friends
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world Ah, you fake just like a woman
Yes, you do, you make love just like a woman
Yes, you do, then you ache just like a woman
But you break just like a little girl Every time my baby and me go up town
Police come and they knock me down
Cocaine all around my brain Hey baby better come here quick
This old cocaine is making me sick
Cocaine all around my brain Yonder comes my baby, she's dressed in red
She's got a shotgun, says she's gonna kill me dead
Cocaine all around my brain Hey baby you better come here quick
This old cocaine is making me sick
Cocaine all around my brain Early one morning, half past four
Cocaine come knockin' on my door
Cocaine all around my brain Hey baby you better, better come here quick
This old cocaine is making me sick
Cocaine all around my brain Cocaine's for horses and it's not for men
Doctor said it kill you but he don't say when
Cocaine all around my brain Hey baby you better come here quick
This old cocaine is making me sick
Cocaine all around my brain Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son"
Abe say, "Man, you must be puttin' me on"
God say, "No," Abe say, "What?"
God say, "You can do what you want Abe, but
The next time you see me comin', you better run" Well, Abe said, "Where do you want this killin' done?"
God said, "Out on Highway 61" Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know"
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man, I got to run" 0h, Howard just pointed with his gun
And said, "That way down on Highway 61" Well, Mack the Finger said to Louie the King
"I got forty red white and blue shoe strings
And a thousand telephones that don't ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
And Louie the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son" And he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to Highway 61" Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren't right
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white"
He said, "Come here and step into the light" he says, "Hmm, you're right
Let me tell the second mother this has been done" But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61 Now the rovin' gambler, he was very bored
Tryin' to create a next world war
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before
But yes, I think it can be very easily done We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
And have it on Highway 61" You may be an ambassador

You're old enough to kill but not for votin'
You don't believe in war, what's that gun you're totin'? And even the Jordan river has bodies floatin'
But you tell me over and over and over again, my friend
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction Don't you understand what I'm trying to say?
Can't you feel the fears that I'm feeling today?
If the button is pushed, there's no running away
There'll be no one to save with the world in a grave Take a look around you, boy, it's bound to scare you, boy
And you tell me over and over and over again, my friend
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction Yeah, my blood's so mad, feels like coagulatin'
I'm sittin' here, just contemplatin'
I can't twist the truth, it knows no regulation Handful of Senators don't pass legislation

You can bury your dead but don't leave a trace
Hate your next-door-neighbor but don't forget to say grace And you tell me over and over and over and over again my friend
You don't believe we're on the eve of destruction
You don't believe we're on the eve of destruction They're selling postcards of the hanging
They're painting the passports brown
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors
The circus is in town Here comes the blind commissioner
They've got him in a trance
One hand is tied to the tightrope walker
The other is in his pants And the riot squad, they're restless
They need somewhere to go
As Lady and I look out tonight
From Desolation Row Cinderella, she seems so easy
"It takes one to know one," she smiles
And puts her hands in her back pocket
Bette Davis style And in comes Romeo, he's moaning
"You belong to me, I believe"
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend
You'd better leave" And the only sound that's left
After the ambulances go
Is Cinderella sweeping up
On Desolation Row Now the moon is almost hidden
The stars are beginning to hide
The fortune telling lady
Has even taken all her things inside All except for Cain and Abel
And the hunchback of Notre Dame
Everybody's making love
Or else expecting rain And the good Samaritan, he's dressing
He's getting ready for the show
He's going to the carnival
Tonight on Desolation Row Ophelia, she's 'neath the window
For her I feel so afraid
On her 22nd birthday
She already is an old maid To her death is quite romantic
She wears an ironed vest
Her profession's her religion
Her sin is her lifelessness And though her eyes are fixed upon
Noah's great rainbow
She spends her time peeking into
Desolation Row Einstein disguised as Robin Hood
With his memories in a trunk
Passed this way an hour ago
With his friend, a jealous monk Now he looked so immaculately frightful
As he bummed a cigarette
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes
And reciting the alphabet You would not think to look at him
But he was famous long ago
For playing the electric violin
On Desolation Row Dr. Filth, he keeps his world
Inside of a leather cup
But all his sexless patients
They are trying to blow it up Now his nurse, some local loser
She's in charge of the cyanide hole
And she also keeps the cards that read
"Have mercy on his soul" They all play on the penny whistle
You can hear them blow
If you lean your head out far enough
From Desolation Row Across the street they've nailed the curtains
They're getting ready for the feast
The phantom of the opera
In a perfect image of a priest They are spoon-feeding Casanova
To get him to feel more assured
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence
After poisoning him with words And the phantom shouting to skinny girls
"Get out of here if you don't know"
Casanova is just being punished
For going to Desolation Row At midnight all the agents
And the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do And they bring them to the factory
Where their heart attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Check to see that nobody is escaping
To Desolation Row Praise be to Nero's Neptune
The Titanic sails at dawn
Everybody's shouting
"Which side are you on?"
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Elliot
Fighting in the captain's tower
While calypso singers laugh at them
And fishermen hold flowers
Between the windows of the sea
Where lovely mermaids flow
And nobody has to think too much
About Desolation Row
Yes, I received your letter yesterday
About the time the doorknob broke
When you asked me how I was doing
Was that some kind of joke?
All these people that you mentioned
Yes, I know them, they are quite lame
I had to rearrange their faces
And give them all another name
Right now I can't read too good
Don't send me no more letters, no
Not unless you mail them from
Desolation Row (First release, Live version Portsmouth, England, September 24, 2000) Traditional, arranged by Bob Dylan Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!
Would you please welcome Columbia recording artist Bob Dylan. Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me,
Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me,
Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me,
Must have been the hand of the lord. While I was praying, somebody touched me,
While I was praying, somebody touched me,
While I was praying, somebody touched me,
Must have been the hand of the lord. Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me,
Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me,
Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me,
Must have been the hand of the lord. Well, it was on a Sunday, somebody touched me,
It was on a Sunday, somebody touched me,
It was on a Sunday, somebody touched me,
Must have been the hand of the lord. Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me,
Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me,
Glory, glory, glory, somebody touched me,
Must have been the hand of the lord. Oh, my name, it ain't nothin', my age, it means less
The country I come from is called the Midwest
I's taught and brought up there, the laws to abide
And that the land that I live in has God on its side Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well
The cavalries charged, the Indians died
Oh, the country was young
With God on its side The Spanish-American War had its day
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
With guns in their hands and God on their side The First World War, boys, it came and it went
The reason for fighting I never did get
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side The Second World War came to an end
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried
The Germans now too have God on their side I learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life
If another war comes, it's them we must fight
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide
And accept it all bravely with God on my side But now we got weapons of chemical dust
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must
One push of the button and a shot the world wide
You never ask questions when God's on your side Through many a dark hour I been thinkin' about this
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side So now as I'm leavin', I'm weary as hell
The confusion I'm feelin' ain't no tongue can tell
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor
That if God's on our side, he'll stop the next war If today was not an crooked highway
If tonight was not an crooked trail
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time
Then lonesome would mean nothing to me at all Yes and only if my own true love was waiting
If I could hear her heart softly pounding
If only she was lying by me
Then I'd lie in my bed once again I can't see my reflection in the water
I can't speak the sounds that show no pain
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
I can't remember the sound of my own name Yes and only if my own true love was waiting
If I could hear her heart softly pounding
If only she was lying by me
Then I'd lie in my bed once again There's beauty in the silver singing river
There's beauty in the sunrise in the sky
But none of these and nothing else could match the beauty
That I remember in my true love's eyes Yes and only if my own true love was waiting
If I could hear her heart softly pounding
If only she was lying by me
Then I'd lie in my bed once again If today was not an endless highway
If tonight was not an endless trail
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time
Then lonesome would mean nothing to me at all Yes and only if my own true love was waiting
If I could hear her heart softly pounding
If only she was lying by me
Then I'd lie in my bed once again Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're tryin' to be so quiet?
We'll sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
And Louise holds a handful of rain
Tempting you to defy it Lights flicker from the opposite loft
In this room the heat pipes just cough
The country music station plays soft
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off Just Louise
And her lover, so entwined
And these visions of Johanna
That conquer my mind In the empty lot where the ladies play blind man's bluff with the key chain
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D Train
We can hear the nightwatchman click his flashlight
Ask himself if it's him or them that's insane Louise, she's alright, she's just near
Like silk she's delicate and seems like the mirror
But she makes it all to concise and clear
That Johanna's not here The ghost of electricity
Howls in the bones of her face
Where these visions of Johanna
Have now taken my place Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
And when bringing her name up
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me He's sure got a lot of gall
To be so useless and all
Muttering small talk at the wall
While I'm in the hall Oh, how can I explain?
It's so hard to get on
And these visions of Johanna
They've kept me up past the dawn Inside the museums, infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while
But Mona Lisa must have had the highway blues
You can tell by the way she smiles See the primitive wallflower freeze
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say "Jeez,
I can't find my knees" Both jewels and binoculars
Hang from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna
They make it all seem so cruel The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him"
But like Louise always says
"You can't look at much, can you man?" as she herself prepares for him My Madonna, she still has not showed
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps to the road
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes The harmonicas play
The skeleton keys and the rain
And these visions of Johanna
Are now all that remain John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore.
His mama sure was proud of him!
He stood straight and tall in his uniform and all.
His mama's face broke out all in a grin. "Oh son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
You make me proud to know you hold a gun.
Do what the captain says, lots of medals you will get,
And we'll put them on the wall when you come home." As that old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
Tellin' ev'ryone in the neighborhood:
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know."
She made well sure her neighbors understood. She got a letter once in a while and her face broke into a smile
As she showed them to the people from next door.
And she bragged about her son with his uniform and gun,
And these things you called a good old-fashioned war. Oh! Good old-fashioned war! Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come.
They ceased to come for about ten months or more.
Then a letter finally came saying, "Go down and meet the train.
Your son's a-coming home from the war." She smiled and went right down, she looked everywhere around
But she could not see her soldier son in sight.
But as all the people passed, she saw her son at last,
When she did she could hardly believe her eyes. Oh his face was all shot up and his hand was all blown off
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
He whispered kind of slow, in a voice she did not know,
While she couldn't even recognize his face! Oh! Lord! Not even recognize his face. "Oh tell me, my darling son, pray tell me what they done.
How is it you come to be this way?"
He tried his best to talk but his mouth could hardly move
And the mother had to turn her face away. "Don't you remember, Ma, when I went off to war
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
I was on the battleground, you were home . . . acting proud.
You wasn't there standing in my shoes." "Oh, and I thought when I was there, God, what am I doing here?
I'm a-tryin' to kill somebody or die tryin'.
But the thing that scared me most was when my enemy came close
And I saw that his face looked just like mine." Oh! Lord! Just like mine! "And I couldn't help but think, through the thunder rolling and stink,
That I was just a puppet in a play.
And through the roar and smoke, this string is finally broke,
And a cannon ball blew my eyes away." As he turned away to walk, his Ma was still in shock
At seein' the metal brace that helped him stand.
But as he turned to go, he called his mother close
And he dropped his medals down into her hand. Shadows are fallin' and I've been here all day
It's too hot to sleep and time is runnin' away
Feel like my soul has turned into steel
I've still got the scars that the sun didn't heal
There's not even room enough to be anywhere
It's not dark yet but it's gettin' there. Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kind of pain
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind
She put down in writin' what was in her mind
I just don't see why I should even care
It's not dark yet but it's gettin' there. Well, I've been to London and I been to gay Paris
I've followed the river and I got to the sea
I've been down on the bottom of the world full of lies
I ain't lookin' for nothin' in anyone's eyes
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear
It's not dark yet but it's gettin' there. I was born here and I'll die here against my will
I know it looks like I'm movin' but I'm standin' still
Every nerve in my body is so naked and numb
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from
Don't even hear the murmur of a prayer
It's not dark yet but it's gettin' there. You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun Look out, the saints are comin' through
And it's all over now, Baby Blue The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets The sky too is folding under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home
Your empty-handed army is all going home
Your lover who just walked out the door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor The carpet too is moving under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue Leave your stepping stones behind there, something calls for you
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
Strike another match, go start anew
And it's all over now, Baby Blue Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll
We ducked inside a doorway as thunder went crashing
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake
Tolling for the luckless, they abandoned and forsaked
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder
As the clanging of the church bells blew far into the breeze
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind
And the poet and the painter far behind his rightful time
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin' In the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
For the disrobed faceless forms of no position
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts
All down in taken-for-granted situations Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
And the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting
Electric light still struck like arrows fired but for the ones
Condemned to drift or else be kept from driftin' Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless seeking trail
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing Starry-eyed and laughing as I recall when we were caught
Trapped by no track of ours for they hang suspended
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look
Spellbound and swallowed 'til the tolling ended Tolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin' When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You haven't seen nothing like me yet I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love Well, if you're travelin' in the north country fair,
where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
remember me to one who lives there.
she once was a true love of mine.
Well, if you go when the snowflakes storm,
when the rivers freeze and summer ends,
please see if she's wearing a coat so warm,
to keep her from the howlin' winds.
Please see for me if her hair hangs long,
if it rolls and flows all down her breast.
please see for me if her hair hangs long,
that's the way i remember her best.
I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all.
many times i've often prayed
in the darkness of my night,
in the brightness of my day.
So if you're travelin' in the north country fair,
where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
remember me to one who lives there.
she once was a true love of mine. 'Twas down in Mississippi not so long ago,
When a young boy from Chicago town stepped through a
Southern door.
This boy's dreadful tragedy I can still remember well,
The color of his skin was black and his name was Emmett Till. Some men they dragged him to a barn and there they beat him up.
They said they had a reason, but I disremember what.
They tortured him and did some evil things too evil to
repeat.
There was screaming sounds inside the barn, there was
laughing sounds out on the street. Then they rolled his body down a gulf amidst a blood-red rain
And they threw him in the waters wide to cease his
screaming pain.
The reason that they killed him there, and I'm sure it
ain't no lie,
He was a black-skinned boy, so
he was born to die. And then to stop the United States of yelling for a trial,
Two brothers they confessed that they had killed poor
Emmett Till.
But on the jury there were men who helped the brothers
commit this awful crime,
And so this trial was a mockery, but nobody seemed to mind. I saw the morning papers but I could not bear to see
The smiling brothers walkin' down the courthouse stairs.
For the jury found them innocent and the brothers they went free,
While Emmett's body floats the foam of a Jim Crow southern sea. If you can't speak out against this kind of thing, a crime
that's so unjust,
Your eyes are filled with dead men's dirt, your mind is
filled with dust.
Your arms and legs they must be in shackles and chains, and
your blood it must refuse to flow,
For you let this human race fall down so God-awful low! This song is just a reminder to remind your fellow man
That this kind of thing still lives today in that
ghost-robed Ku Klux Klan.
But if all us folks that thinks alike, if we gave all we
could give,
We could make this great land of ours a greater place to live. If not for you
Babe, I couldn't find the door
Couldn't even see the floor
I'd be sad and blue
If not for you If not for you
Babe, I'd lay awake all night
Wait for the mornin' light
To shine in through
But it would not be new
If not for you If not for you
My sky would fall
Rain would gather, too
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all
I'd be lost if not for you
And you know it's true If not for you
My sky would fall
Rain would gather, too
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all
Oh! What would I do
If not for you If not for you
Winter would have no spring
Couldn't hear the robin sing
I just wouldn't have a clue
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true
If not for you Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like
Two jewels in the sky
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth
On the pillow where you lie
But I don't sense affection
No gratitude or love
Your loyalty is not to me but to the stars above. One more cup of coffee for the road.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below Your daddy he's an outlaw
And a wanderer by trade
He'll teach you how to pick an' choose
And how to throw the blade
And he oversees his kingdom
So no stranger does intrude
His voice it trembles as he calls out
For another plate of food One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below Your sister sees the future
Like your momma and yourself
You've never learned to read or write
There's no books upon your shelf
And your pleasure know no limits
Your voice is like a meadow lark
But your heart is like an ocean
Mysterious and dark One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below Well, if you're travelin' in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine Well, if you go when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see if she's wearing a coat so warm
To keep her from the howlin' winds Please see for me if her hair hangs long
If it rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see for me if her hair hangs long
That's the way I remember her best I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all
Many times I've often prayed
In the darkness of my night
In the brightness of my day So if you're travelin' in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine Someone's got it in for me
They're planting stories in the press
Whoever it is I wish they'd cut it out quick
But when they will I can only guess They say I shot a man named Gray
And took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks
And when she died it came to me
I can't help it if I'm lucky People see me all the time
And they just can't remember how to act
Their minds are filled with big ideas
Images and distorted facts Even you, yesterday
You had to ask me where it was at
I couldn't believe after all these years
You didn't know me, any better than that
Sweet lady Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth
Blowing down the back roads headin' south
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
You're an idiot babe
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe I ran into the fortune-teller, who said
"Beware of lightnin' that might strike"
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long
I can't remember what it's like There's a lone soldier on the cross
Smoke pourin' out of a boxcar door
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done
In the final end he won the war
After losin' every battle I woke up on the roadside
Daydreamin' 'bout the way things sometimes are
Visions of your chestnut mare
Shoot through my head and are makin' me see stars You hurt the ones that I love best
And cover up the truth with lies
One day you'll be in the ditch
Flies buzzin' around your eyes
Blood on your saddle Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb
Blowing through the curtains in your room
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
You're an idiot babe
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe It was gravity which pulled us down
And destiny which broke us apart
You tamed the lion in my cage
But it just wasn't enough to change my heart Now everything's a little upside down
As a matter of fact the wheels have stopped
What's good is bad, what's bad is good
You'll find out when you reach the top
You're on the bottom I noticed at the ceremony
Your corrupt ways had finally made you blind
I can't remember your face anymore
Your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine The priest wore black on the seventh day
And sat stone-faced while the building burned
I waited for you on the running boards
Near the cypress tree
While the springtime turned, slowly into autumn Idiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
You're an idiot, babe
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe I can't feel you anymore
I can't even touch the books you've read
Every time I crawl past your door
I been wishin' I've been somebody else instead Down the highway, down the tracks
Down the road to ecstasy
I followed you beneath the stars
Hounded by your memory
And all your ragin' glory I been double-crossed now
For the very last time and now I'm finally free
I kissed goodbye the howling beast
On the borderline which separated you from me You'll never know the hurt I suffered
Nor the pain I rise above
And I'll never know the same about you
Your holiness or your kind of love
And it makes me feel so sorry Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats
Blowing through the letters that we wrote
Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves
We're idiots, babe
It's a wonder we can even feed ourselves When you're sad and when you're lonely
And you haven't got a friend
Just remember that death is not the end And all that you held sacred
Falls down and does not mend
Just remember that death is not the end Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end When you're standin' on their crossroads
That you cannot comprehend
Just remember that death is not the end And all your dreams have vanished
And you don't know what's up the bend
Just remember that death is not the end Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end When the storm clouds gather round you
And heavy rains descend
Just remember that death is not the end And there's no one there to comfort you
With a helpin' hand to lend
Just remember that death is not the end Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end Oh, the tree of life is growing
Where the spirit never dies
And the bright light of salvation shines
In dark and empty skies When the cities are on fire
With the burnin' flesh of men
Just remember that death is not the end And you search in vain to find
Just one law abiding citizen
Just remember that death is not the end Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end If you see her, say hello
She might be in Tangier
She left here last early spring
Is living there I hear Say for me that I'm all right
Though things get kind of slow
She might think that I've forgotten her
Don't tell her it isn't so We had a falling-out
Like lovers often will
And to think of how she left that night
It still brings me a chill And though our separation
It pierced me to the heart
She still lives inside of me
We've never been apart If you get close to her
Kiss her once for me
I always have respected her
For doing what she did and getting free Oh, whatever makes her happy
I won't stand in the way
Oh, the bitter taste still lingers on
From the night I tried to make her stay I see a lot of people
As I make the rounds
And I hear her name here and there
As I go from town to town And I've never gotten used to it
I've just learned to turn it off
Either I'm too sensitive
Or else I'm getting soft Sundown yellow moon
I replay the past
I know every scene by heart
They all went by so fast If she's passing back this way
I'm not that hard to find
Tell her she can look me up
If she's got the time Johnny Todd he took a notion
For to sail the ocean wide.
There he left his true love waiting
Weeping on the Liverpool side.
For a week she wept full sorely,
Tore her hair and wrung her hands
Till she met with another sailor
Walking on the Liverpool sands.
O fair maid why are you weeping
For your Johnny gone to sea?
If you'll wed with me tomorrow
I will kind and constant be.
I will buy you sheets and blankets,
I'll buy you a wedding ring.
You shall have a gilded cradle
For to rock you baby in.
Johnny Todd came home from sailing,
Far across the ocean wide,
There he found that his fair and false one
Was another sailor's bride.
So, all you lads who go a-sailing
For to fight the foreign foe.
Never leave your true love like Johnny,
Marry her before you go! Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
While we all sup sorrow with the poor
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears
Oh, hard times, come again no more 'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh, hard times, come again no more While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay
There are frail forms fainting at the door
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say
Oh, hard times, come again no more 'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh, hard times, come again no more There's pale drooping maiden who foils her life away
With a worn out heart, whose better days are over
Though her voice it would be merry, 't is sighing all the day
Oh, hard times, come again no more 'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh, hard times, come again no more 'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh, hard times, come again no more Oh, I'm sailin' away, my own true love
I'm sailin' away in the morning
Is there something I can send you from across the sea
From the place that I'll be landing? No, there's nothin' you can send me, my own true love
There's nothin' I'm wishin' to be ownin'
Just a-carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine
Made of silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona If I had the stars of the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
For that's all I'm wishin' to be ownin' That I might be gone a long old time
And it's only that I'm askin'
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
To make your time more easy passin'? Oh, how can, how can you ask me again?
It only brings me sorrow
The same thing I would want today
I will want again tomorrow Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day
It was from her ship a-sailin'
Saying "I don't know when I'll be comin' back again
It depends on how I'm a-feelin'" If you, my love, must think that-a-way
I'm sure your mind is a-roamin'
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me
But with the country to where you're goin' So take heed, take heed of the western winds
Take heed of the stormy weather
And yes, there's something you can send back to me
Spanish boots of Spanish leather She's got everything she needs
She's an artist, she don't look back.
She's got everything she needs She's an artist, she don't look back.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime
And paint the daytime black. You will start out standing
Proud to steal her anything she sees.
You will start out standing Proud to steal her anything she sees.
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole
Down upon your knees. She never stumbles
She's got no place to fall.
She never stumbles
She's got no place to fall.
She's nobody's child
The Law can't touch her at all.
She wears an Egyptian ring
That sparkles before she speaks.
She wears an Egyptian ring
That sparkles before she speaks.
She's a hypnotist collector
You are a walking antique.
Bow down to her on Sunday
Salute her when her birthday comes.
Bow down to her on Sunday
Salute her when her birthday comes.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet
And for Christmas, give her a drum. I've seen love go by my door
It's never been this close before
Never been so easy or so slow
I been shootin' in the dark too long
When something's not right it's wrong
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go Dragon clouds so high above
I've only known careless love
It always has hit me from below
But this time 'round it's more correct
Right on target so direct
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go Purple clover, Queen Anne lace
Crimson hair across your face
You can make me cry but you don't know
Can't remember what I was thinking of
You might be spoiling me too much love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme
Blue river running slow and lazy
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time Situations have ended sad
Relationships have all been bad
Mine have been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's
But there's no way I can compare
All them scenes to this affair,
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing
Staying far behind without you
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking to I'll look for you in old Honolulu
San Francisco or Ashtabula
You're gonna have to leave me now I know
But I'll see you in the sky above
In the tall grass in the ones I love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go Da da dah da da.

Look away, you rollin' river
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you
Look away. We're bound away
Across the wide Missouri Now the Missouri is a mighty river
Look away, you rollin' river.
Indians camp along her border
Look away. We're bound away
Across the wide Missouri Well a white man loved an Indian maiden
Look away, you rollin' river
With notions his canoe was laden
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri Oh Shenandoah, I love your daughter
Look away, you rollin' river
It was for her I'd cross the water.
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri For seven long years I courted Sally
Look away, you rollin' river
Seven more years I longed to have her
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri Well, it's fare-thee-well, my dear,
I'm bound to leave you
Look away you rollin' river
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Well, I wake up in the morning
Fold my hands and pray for rain.
I got a head full of ideas
That are drivin' me insane.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more. I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Well, he hands you a nickel
He hands you a dime
He asks you with a grin
If you're havin' a good time
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more. I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Well, he puts his cigar
Out in your face just for kicks.
His bedroom window
It is made out of bricks.
The National Guard stands around his door.
Ah, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more. I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Well, she talks to all the servants
About man and God and law.
Everybody says
She's the brains behind pa.
She's sixty-eight, but she says she's twenty-four.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more. I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Well, I try my best
To be just like I am
But everybody wants you
To be just like them.
They sing while you slave and I just get bored.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more. The man in me will do nearly any task,
And as for compensation, there's a-little he would ask.
Take a woman like you
To get through to the man in me. Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
I think to myself I might not take it any more.
Take a woman like your kind
To find the man in me. But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Just to know that you are near,
It sets my a heart a-reeling
From my toes up to my ears. The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from bein' seen,
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine.
Took a woman like you
To get through to the man in me. Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good
They'll stone you just a-like they said they would
They'll stone you when you're tryin' to go home
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned Well, they'll stone you when you're walkin' 'long the streets
They'll stone you when you're tryin' to keep your seat
They'll stone you when you're walkin' on the floor
They'll stone you when you're walkin' to the door But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table
They'll stone you when you are young and able
They'll stone you when you're tryin' to make a buck
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck" Hey, but I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar Yes, but I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned, alright! Well, they'll stone you when you walk all alone
They'll stone you when you are walkin' home
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave"
They'll stone you when you are set down in your grave But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers' blood.
A finger fired the trigger to his name.
A handle hid out in the dark
A hand set the spark
Two eyes took the aim
Behind a man's brain
But he can't be blamed
He's only a pawn in their game. A South politician preaches to the poor white man,
"You got more than the blacks, don't complain.
You're better than them, you been born with white skin," they explain.
And the Negro's name
Is used it is plain
For the politician's gain
As he rises to fame
And the poor white remains
On the caboose of the train
But it ain't him to blame
He's only a pawn in their game. The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
And the marshals and cops get the same,
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
He's taught in his school
From the start by the rule
That the laws are with him
To protect his white skin
To keep up his hate
So he never thinks straight
'Bout the shape that he's in
But it ain't him to blame
He's only a pawn in their game. From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks,
And the hoof beats pound in his brain.
And he's taught how to walk in a pack
Shoot in the back
With his fist in a clinch
To hang and to lynch
To hide 'neath the hood
To kill with no pain
Like a dog on a chain
He ain't got no name
But it ain't him to blame
He's only a pawn in their game. Today, Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
They lowered him down as a king.
But when the shadowy sun sets on the one
That fired the gun
You'll see by his grave
On the stone that remains
Carved next to his name
His epitaph plain:
Only a pawn in their game. In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed
There's a dyin' voice within me reaching out somewhere,
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair. Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
Like Cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
In the fury of the moment I can see the Master's hand
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand. Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer.
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay. I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
And every time I pass that way I always hear my name.
Then onward in my journey I come to understand
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand. I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face. I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand. They sat together in the park
As the evening sky grew dark.
She looked at him and he felt a spark
Tingle to his bones.
'Twas then he felt alone
And wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate. They walked alone by the old canal.
A little confused, I remember well,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright.
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train
Moving with a simple twist of fate. A saxophone someplace far off played
As she was walking on by the arcade
As the light bust through a beat up shade
Where he was waking up.
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate. He woke up; the room was bare.
He didn't see her anywhere.
He told himself he didn't care; pushed the window open wide;
Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate. He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks.
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks
Where the sailors all come in.
Maybe she'll pick him out again. How long must he wait
One more time for a simple twist of fate. People tell me it's a sin
To know and feel too much within.
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring.
She was born in spring, but I was born too late.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate. Mama, take this badge off o' me
I can't use it anymore
It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
I feel I'm knockin' on Heaven's door Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door Mama, put that gun to the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
There's a long black cloud is comin' down
I feel I'm knockin' on Heaven's door Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
An' cov'rin' the crossroads I'm standing at,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
But mama, you been on my mind. I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
I am not pleadin', or sayin' "I can't forget you."
I do not pace the floor bowed down an' bent, but yet,
Mama, you been on my mind. Even though my eyes are hazy an' my thoughts they might be narrow,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down in sorrow.
I don't even mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
Mama, you're just on my mind. I am not askin' you to say words like "yes" or "no,"
Please understand me, I've no place I'm calling you t' go.
I'm just whisperin' to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
Mama, you are on my mind. When you wake up in the mornin', baby, look inside your mirror.
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near.
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
As someone who has had you on his mind. Down in some lone valley
In a sad lonesome place
Where the wild birds do all
Their notes to increase Farewell pretty Saro
I bid you Adieu
But I dream of pretty Saro
Wherever I go Well my love she won't have me
So I understand
She wants a freeholder
Who owns a house and land I cannot maintain her
With silver and gold
And all of the fine things
That a big house can hold If I was a poet
And could write a fine hand
I'd write my love a letter
That she'd understand And write it by the river
Where the waters overflow
But I dream of pretty Saro
Wherever I go Oh, fare thee well, my own true love, fare thee well but for a while
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann. Ten thousand miles away from home, ten thousand miles or more
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
If I never nomore return to you, Mary Ann. Oh, don't you see that crow fly high, she'll surely turn to white
If never I prove false to you
Let the day turn to night, my dear, Mary Ann. If I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
And a great big bowl for two to mix it in
I'd pour a drink for you my dear, Mary Ann
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you my dear, Mary Ann. 1. Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
As we went a-walkin' down by the seaside,
Mark now what followed and what did betide,
For it bein' on Christmas mornin'
Now, for recreation, we went on a tramp,
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
And a little wee drummer intending to camp,
For the day bein' pleasant and charmin'. 2. "Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant he cried.
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
Intending no harm but meant to pass by,
For it bein' on Christmas mornin'
"But", says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
Ten guineas in gold I'll stick to your fist,
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust,
And drink the king's health in the morning. 3. "For a soldier, he leads a very fine life,
And he always is blessed with a charming young wife,
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife,
And he always lives pleasant and charmin',
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen.
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean,
And sup on thin gruel in the morning." Instrumental 4. "But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes,
For you've only the lend of them, as I suppose,
But you dare not change them one night, for you know
If you do, you'll be flogged in the morning,
And although that we're single and free,
We take great delight in our own company,
We have no desire strange places to see,
Although that your offers are charming. 5. "And we have no desire to take your advance,
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance,
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France,
Where we would get shot without warning,"
"Oh no," says the Sergeant. "I'll have no such chat,
And neither will I take it from snappy young brats,
For if you insult me with one other word,
I'll cut off your heads in the morning." 6. And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
And we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head
And bid them take that as fair warning.
And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
We flung them as far as we could in the tide,
"Now take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride,
"And temper their edge in the mornin'!" 7. And the little wee drummer, we flattened his bow,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll,
And bade it a tedious returning,
And we havin' no money, paid them off in cracks.
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks,
And left them for dead in the morning. 8. And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits,
For we were the lads who would give them hard clouts
And bid them look sharp in the mornin'. Instrumental 9. Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
As we went a-walkin' down by the seaside,
Mark now what followed and what did betide,
For it bein' on Christmas mornin' I will not go down under the ground
"cause somebody tells me that death's comin' 'round
an' i will not carry myself down to die
when i go to my grave my head will be high,
let me die in my footsteps
before i go down under the ground.
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been
the meaning of the life has been lost in the wind
and some people thinkin' that the end is close by
"stead of learnin' to live they are learning to die.
let me die in my footsteps
before i go down under the ground.
I don't know if i'm smart but i think i can see
when someone is pullin' the wool over me
and if this war comes and death's all around
let me die on this land 'fore i die underground.
let me die in my footsteps
before i go down under the ground.
There's always been people that have to cause fear
they've been talking of the war now for many long years
i have read all their statements and i've not said a word
but now lawd god, let my poor voice be heard.
let me die in my footsteps
before i go down under the ground.
If i had rubies and riches and crowns
i'd buy the whole world and change things around
i'd throw all the guns and the tanks in the sea
for they are mistakes of a past history.
let me die in my footsteps
before i go down under the ground.
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood
let me smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood
let me sleep in your meadows with the green grassy leaves
let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace.
let me die in my footsteps
before i go down under the ground.
Go out in your country where the land meets the sun
see the craters and the canyons where the waterfalls run
nevada, new mexico, arizona, idaho
let every state in this union seep in your souls.
and you'll die in your footsteps
before you go down under the ground. Every step of the way, we walk the line
Your days are numbered, so are mine
Time is piling up, we struggle and we stray
We're all boxed in, nowhere to escape City's just a jungle, more games to play
Trapped in the heart of it, tryin' to get away
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down Got nothing for you, I had nothing before
Don't even have anything for myself anymore
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down
Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all
I was thinking about the things that Rosie said
I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosie's bed Walking through the leaves, falling from the trees
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees
So many things that we never will undo
I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too Some people will offer you their hand and some won't
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't
I need something strong to distract my mind
I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind Well I got here following the southern star
I crossed that river just to be where you are
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long Well my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free
I've got nothing but affection for all those who sailed with me Everybody's moving, if they ain't already there
Everybody got to move somewhere
Stick with me baby, stick with me anyhow
Things should start to get interesting right about now My clothes are wet, tight on my skin
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long Ramona, come closer, shut softly your watery eyes
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
For the flowers of the city, though breathlike, get deathlike sometimes
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines Your cracked country lips, I still wish to kiss, as to be by the strength of your skin
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feelin' like this I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth
I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to to the south
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand
Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose
From fixtures and forces and friends, your sorrow does stem
That hype you and type you, making you feel that you gotta be just like them I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words would turn into a meaningless ring
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring
Everything passes, everything changes, just do what you think you should do
And someday, maybe, who knows, baby, I'll come and be crying to you Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Summers almost gone, winters coming on
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And it seems like I've gotta travel on
And it seems like I've gotta travel on Papa writes to Johnny, Johnny can't come home
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home
Papa writes to Johnny, Johnny can't come home
Johnny's been out on the road too long So I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Summers almost gone, winters coming on
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And it seems like I've gotta travel on That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
Going home to stay, going home to stay
And that chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
And I feel like I just wanna travel on So I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Summers almost gone, winters coming on, oh, yes I
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And it seems like I've gotta travel on There's a lonesome freight at 6: 08 a coming through the town
I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound
A lonesome freight at 6: 08 coming all through the town
And I feel like I just wanna travel on Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Summers almost gone, winters coming on, yes it is
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And it seems like I've gotta travel on The guilty undertaker sighs
The lonesome organ grinder cries
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you
The cracked bells and washed-out horns
Blow into my face with scorn
But it's not that way
I wasn't born to lose you
I want you, I want you
I want you so bad
Honey, I want you The drunken politician leaps
Upon the streets where mothers weep
And the saviors who are fast asleep
They wait for you
And I wait for them to interrupt
Me drinkin' from my broken cup
And ask me to open up the gate for you
I want you, I want you
Yes, I want you so bad
Honey, I want you Now my fathers, they've gone down
True love they've been without it
But all their daughters put me down 'Cause I don't think about it Well, I return to the Queen of Spades
And talk with my chambermaid
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her
She is good to me
And there's nothing she doesn't see
She knows where I'd like to be
But it doesn't matter
I want you, I want you
Yes, I want you so bad Honey, I want you Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit
He spoke to me, I took his flute
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
But I did it because he lied
Because he took you for a ride
And because time was on his side
And because I...
Want you, I want you
Yes, I want you so bad
Honey, I want you He was a friend of mine
He was a friend of mine
Every time I think about him now
Lord I just can't keep from cryin'
'Cause he was a friend of mine He died on the road
He died on the road
He never had enough money
To pay his room or board
And he was a friend of mine I stole away and cried
I stole away and cried
'Cause I never had too much money
And I never been quite satisfied
And he was a friend of mine He never done no wrong
He never done no wrong
A thousand miles from home
And he never harmed no one
And he was a friend of mine He was a friend of mine
He was a friend of mine
Every time I hear his name
Lord I just can't keep from cryin'
'Cause he was a friend of mine. Everybody's building
The big ships and the boats
Some are building monuments
Others are jotting down notes Everybody's in despair
Every girl and boy
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here
Everybody jump for joy Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn Now I like to dude, just like the rest
I left my sugar sweet
But darning fumes and making haste
It ain't my cup of meat Everybody's just standin' around 'neath the trees
Feeding pigeons on a limb
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here
Then pigeons will go to him Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn [Incomprehensible]
I can recite 'em all
Just tell me where it hurts
And I'll tell you who to call Nobody can get in his sleep
There's someone on everybody's toes
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here
Everybody's gonna doze Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn

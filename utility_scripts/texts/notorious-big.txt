Fuck all you hoes
Get a grip mothafucka
Yeah, this album is dedicated to all the teachers
That told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin'
In front of that called the police on me when I was just tryin'
To make some money to feed my daughter And all the niggas in the struggle, you know what I'm sayin'? It's all good baby, baby It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt 'n' Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed and bamboo, sippin' on private stock
Way back when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood, it's all good
And if you don't know, now you know nigga You know very well who you are Don't let 'em hold you down, reach for the stars You had a goal, but not that many
'Cause you're the only one, I'll give you good and plenty
I made the change from a common thief To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way The Moet and Alize keep me pissy, girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rappin' stuff
I was too used to packin' gats and stuff Now honies play me close like butter played toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Livin' life without fear
Puttin' 5 karats in my baby girl's ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
And if you don't know, now you know nigga You know very well who you are Don't let 'em hold you down, reach for the stars You had a goal, but not that many
'Cause you're the only one, I'll give you good and plenty Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis When I was dead broke, man I couldn't picture this 50 inch screen, money green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is loungin'
Celebratin' every day, no more public housin'
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps a Ac' with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off, of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip champagne when we thirsty
Damn right I like the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive
And it's all, it's all good
And if you don't know, now you know nigga

You go call your crew, we can rendezvous at the bar around two
Plans to leave, throw the keys to little cease
Pull the truck up, front and roll up the next blunt

A T bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few 'cause in a few, we gon' do

All my life I been considered as the worst
Lying to my mother, even stealing out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fucking abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger
(Get a hold of yourself nigga)
Sucking on her chest just to stop my fucking hunger
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies
My baby mother's eight months, her little sister's two
Who's to blame for both of them
(Naw nigga, not you)
I swear to God I want to just slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
(Nigga what the fuck)
And squeeze, until the bed's completely red
(It's too late for this shit man)
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fucking buddha head
The stress is building up, I can't
(Yo, I'm on my way over there man)
I can't believe suicide's on my fucking mind, I wanna leave
I swear to God I feel like death is fucking calling me
Naw you wouldn't understand
(Nigga talk to me please, man)
You see it's kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no coming back
(Yo, I'mma call you when I get in the car)
Should I die on the train track, like Ramo in Beat Street
People at the funeral fronting like they miss me
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone
(Put your girl on the phone, nigga)
She knew me and her sister had something going on
I reach my peak, I can't speak
(Yo, you listening to me motherfucker)
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak
(Eyo c'mon nigga)
I'm sick of niggas lying, I'm sick of bitches hawkin'
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talking
(BANG) Ayo Big, ayo Big Heartbeat slowing
Please hang up, and try your call again I was a terror since the public school era
Bathroom passes, cuttin classes, squeezing asses
Smoking blunts was a daily routine
Since thirteen, a chubby nigga on the scene
I used to have the tre' duce
And the duce duce in my bubblegoose
Now i got the mack in my knapsack
Loungin' black, smoking sacks up in acts
And sidekicks with my sidekicks rockin fly kicks
Honeys want to chat
But all we wanna know is "Where the party at?"
And can i bring my gat?
If not, I hope I don't get shot
But i throw my vest on my chest
'Cause niggaz is a mess
It don't take nothin' but frontin'
For me to start somethin'
Buggin' and barkin' at niggaz like i was duck huntin'
Dumbing out, just me and my crew
Cause all we wanna do is... Bullshit ... And party, and... Hugs from the honeys, Pounds from the roughnecks
Seen my man Sei that I knew from the projects
Said he had beef, asked me if I had my piece
Sure do, two .22's in my shoes
Holler if you need me love i'm in the house
Roam and strollin' see what the honeys is about
Moet popping, hoe hopping, ain't no stopping Big Poppa, I'm a BAD BOY
Niggaz wanna front, who got your back? (BIGGIE!)
Niggaz wanna flex, who got the gat? (BIGGIE!)
It ain't hard to tell I'm the east coast overdoser
Nigga you scared you're supposed to
Nigga I toast ya, put fear in your heart
Fuck up the party before it even start
Pissy drunk, off the Henny and stuff
Or some brand-nubian shit beatin' down punks! Bitches in the back looking righteous
In a tight dress, i think i might just
Hit her with a little Biggie 101, How to tote a gun
And have fun with Jamaician rum
Conversations, blunts in rotation
My man Big Jacques got the glock in his waist and
we're smoking, drinking, got the hooker thinking
If money smell bad than this nigga Biggie stinking
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eatin out my palm
She grabbed my arm and said "Let's leave calm"
I'm hittin' skins again
Rolled up another blunt, bought a Heineken
Niggaz start to loke out, a kid got choked out
Blows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out (Music stops, indecipherable sounds of people yelling and arguing,
Biggie breaks it up yelling "Yo chill, man, chill!") Can't we just all get along?
So i can put hickies on her chest like Lil' Shaun
Get her pissy drunk off of Don Perrignon
And it's on, and I'm gone
that's that. (w/ Puff talking after selected lines) Party... and Bullshit, (Party.)

It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see I don't know what, they want from me
It's like the more money we come across

It's Bone and Biggie, Biggie Armed and dangerous, ain't too many can bang with us
Straight up weed, no angel dust, label us "Notorious"
Thug ass niggas that love to bust, it's strange to us
Y'all niggas be scrambling, gambling Up in restaurants with mandolins and violins
We just sitting here tryna win, try not to sin
High off weed and lots of gin
So much smoke need oxygen, steadily counting them Benjamins
Nigga you should too, if you knew what this game'll do to you
Been in this shit since '92, look at all the bullshit I been through!
So-called beef with you-know-who
Fucked a few female stars or two Nigga, blue light, nigga, move like Mike, shit
Not to be fucked with
Motherfucker better duck quick cause
Me and my dogs love to buck shit
Fuck the luck shit, strictly aim
No aspirations to quit the game Spit your game, talk your shit
Grab your Gat, call your clique
Squeeze your clip, hit the right one
Pass that weed, I got to light one
All them niggas, I got to fight one
All them hoes, I got to like one
Our situation is a tight one
Whatcha gonna do: fight or run? Seems to me that you'll take B
Bone and Big, nigga: die slowly
I'mma tell you like a nigga told me:
"Cash Rules Everything Around Me"
Shit... lyrically, niggas can't see me Fuck it, buy the coke
Cook the coke, cut it
Know the bitch 'fore you caught yourself loving it
Nigga with a Benz fuckin' it
Doesn't it seem odd to you?
Big come through with mobs and crews
Goodfellas down to the Mo' Thugs dudes
Who's the killer, me or you? (We forgive you, for you know not what you do) 7 A.M., woke in the morning
With Hen' and caffeine and green and nicotine
No dough, so pop a couple of doze
Lil' RIPsta, nigga Mista Clean
Nigga Dean, deep in my temple and not to get
Sentimentally steamed with my
Instrumelody, and heated
Especially for your team
And a .45, indeed, will beam
In between the scenes. Destroy your dreams
You willing to die? We'll see
How many flee when I cause the scene
We mean mug, Mo' Thugs
Trained to be perfect disciples
When it's survival, tongue is a double-edged sword
Triple six rivals spitting fire
This the real truth, bitch
Breaking out for lies
My Messiahs better be ready for Armageddon, shit's expired
It's wild, bless the child
The one that became a man
Put in positions off in the Clair
All that I had to do was stare
Test me now. Contender - never no surrender, no pretend
Pick up my pen, in my hand
One of my trusted friend-friends, hey
Open it! Let's see if we're real, we all suited
Beg my pardon to Martin
Baby we ain't marching, we shooting!
In daily recruiting there's a thug born
Everyday in the ghetto
We start em off little, we give em a bible And a pen and a pad to hit the label, kick it Nigga roll with Bone up into the Thug spot
To the dome with a shot of bird
Never get tossed to the curb
Be feeling that urge to splurge
But I'm broke as fuck, Sin, gimme that Mossberg swerve
Up into my bag, cause I gotta get my mask and shells
To put in this 12-gauge sawed-off
Get 'em hauled off, nigga your loss, take it all off
Got a nigga caught off
But the Bone not Leatherface, too many are thinking they thugs
And little Mo Hart want to pull it and bust it
And bitch: if you steppin' we buckin' them guts, that's fucked up
Now let me get done with the grime
Gotta go purchase a dime
Put in a state to get done with the crime
Smoking the reefer to ease my mind
Swig some wine, step on the block with the rocks
But really we be serving em dummies, see?
Gotta buck him on down if he come back talking
Like "gimme back me money"
Thugging with me killers
Need us a liter of liquor but niggas ain't got shit
With a sawed-off pump, chrome .38 pistol
Now who ready to get bent?
Nigga like me fiending for them green leaves
But I ain't had no dough
Gotta make some money, so
I'm making my dummy rocks if I go broke Just Bone and Biggie Biggie, we gonna rock the party
Rock the party, party
Just Bone and Biggie Biggie, better run and tell everybody

Get high, get high, get high, c'mon
Let's ride let's ride let's ride let's ride
Get high, get high, get high Yeah, Little Lay, hey, coming in the form of scripture
Finna get you and hit you with magic
Droppin down lead but I call it my gadgets
With an automatic-status, we spray, time to load the Glocks
But I'm thinking not
There's another evil force tellin' me to do what I gotta do
So I up my pipe, a nigga dyin' tonight
And I'm always running from the boys in blue
Biggie, blue's on my ass, pull out the cellular phone to call Bone
"What's happenin'?"
Grab artillery, a nigga start packing
Cause a motherfucker tried to get me in a jackin, and I did him
Hit him right between the eyes, the spot was wise
Wanna test a nigga size, it'll cost him
Nigga fuck around with the wrong shit
Y'all get mo' murdered all day, all day
We done paved the way and I'm on the run
I'mma call my boys and bring all the guns
Y'all niggas wanna have a little fun with #1?

How's everybody doin' tonite?
I'd like to welcome to the stage, the lyrically acclaimed, ha
I like this young man, because, when he came out
He came out with the phrase, he went from ashy to classy
Ha, I like that
So everybody in the house, give a warm, round of applause for
The Notorious B.I.G. *clapping*
The Notorious B.I.G. ladies and gentlemen give it up for him ya'll
Uhhh A nigga never been as broke as me, (I like that)
When I was young I had two pair of Lees, (besides that)
The pin stripes and the gray (uh-huh)
The one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While niggas flirt, I'm sewing tigers on my shirt
And alligators
Ya wanna see the inside, huh, I see ya later
Here come the drama, oh, that's that nigga with the fake - blaow!
Why you punch me in my face? Stay in ya place
Play ya position, here come my intuition
Go in this nigga pocket
Rob him while his friends watchin'
and hoes clockin', here comes respect
His crew's your crew, or they might be next
Look at they man eye, BIG man they never try
So we roll wid 'em, stole wid 'em
I mean loyalty, niggaz bought me milks at lunch
The milks was chocolate, the cookies, buttercrunch
In gear - Oshkosh with blue and white dunks
Pass the blunt Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have

What you want, be what you want, have What you want, be what you want Uh-huh, I was ashamed, my crew was lame
I had enough heart for most of 'em
Long as I got stuff from most of 'em
It's on, even when I was wrong I got my point across
They depicted me the boss, of course
My orange box-cutter make the world go round
Plus I'm fuckin', bitches ain't my homegirls now
Start stackin', dabbled in crack, gun packin'
Nickname Medina, make the seniors tote my ninas
From gym class, to Englass, pass off a global
The only nigga with a mobile, can't you see like Total
Gettin' larger in waist and taste
Ain't no tellin' where this felon is headin', just in case
Keep a shell at the tip of ya melon, clear the space
Ya brain was a terrible thing ta waste
Eighty-eight long gates, snatch initial name plates
Smokin' spliffs wit niggaz, real life beginner killers
Prayin' God forgive us for being sinners, help us out Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on

I ain't have ta be in school by ten, I was in
Began to encounter, with my counter-parts
On how ta burn the block apart, break it down into sections
Drugs by the selection
Some use pipes, others use injections
Syringe sold seperately, Frank the deputy
Quick to grab my Smith-n-Wesson, like my dick was missin'
To protect my position, my corner, my layer
While we out here, say the hustlas prayer
If the game shakes me or breaks me
I hope it makes me a better man
Take a better stand
Put money in my moms hand
Get my daughter this college plan, so she don't need no man
Stay far from timid
Only make moves when ya heart's in it
And live the phrase Sky's The Limit
Motherfucker... see you chumps on top Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on

Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis
After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the icepick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
But smalls don't get down like that
Got your father hidin in a room; fucked him with the broom

Kickin down your god damn door (and it goes a lil somethin like this) Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
And everything you get ya gotta work hard for it
Honies shake your hips, ya don't stop
And niggaz pack the clips, keep on Two: Meth, Notorious two, comin with that Olde E brew
Meth-tical, puttin niggaz back in I.C.U.
I'm lifted troop, you can bring yours wack ass crew
I got connections, I'll get that ass stuck like glue, huh
No question, I be comin down and shit
Yo I gets rugged as a motherfuckin carpet get
And niggaz love it, not in the physical form but in the mental
I spark and they cells get warm
I'm not a gentle, man, I'm a Method, Man!
Baby accept it, utmost respect it
(Assume the position) Stop look and listen
I spit on your grave then I grab my Charles Dickens Welcome to my center
Honies feel it deep in they placenta
Cold as the pole in the winter
Far from the inventor, but I got this rap shit sewed
And when my Mac unloads
I'm guaranteed another video
Ready to die, why I act that way?
Pop Duke left Mom Duke
The faggot took the back way
So instead of makin hoes suck my dick up
I used to do stick-up
Cause hoes is irritatin like the hic-CUPS
Excuse me, flows just grow through me
Like trees to branches
Cliffs to avalanches
It's the praying mantis
Deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfuckin rap phenomenon, plus (I got more glocks and techs than you)
I make it hot (Niggas won't even stand next to you)
Nigga touch me you better bust me
tree times in the head
Or motherfucker's dead, ya thought so repeat 2X When the lala hits ya lyrics just splits ya
Head so hard, that ya hat can't fit ya
Either I'm witcha or against ya
Format venture, back through that maze I sent ya
Talkin to the rap inventor
Nigga wit the game tight, Bic that flame right
Spell my name right, B-I, Double-G, I-E
Iced out lights out, me and Cease-a-Leo
Gettin head from some chick he know
See it's all about the cheddar, nobody do it better
Going back to Cali, strictly for the weather
Women, and the weed, sticky green
No seeds bitch please, Poppa ain't soft
Dead up in the Hood, ain't no love lost
Got me mixed up, you drunk them licks up
Mad cause I got my dick sucked
And my balls licked, forfeit, the game is mine
I'ma spell my name one more time, check it
Its the, N-O, T-O, R-I, O

Sippin on booze in the House of Blues I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali If I got to choose a coast I got to choose the East

But that don't mean a nigga can't rest in the West
See some nice breasts in the West
Smoke some nice sess in the West, y'all niggaz is a mess
Thinkin I'm gon stop, givin L.A. props
All I got is beef with those that violate me
I shall annihilate thee
Case closed, suitcase filled with clothes
Linens and things, I begin things
People start to flash
818's, 213's, 313's, B.I.G.
Frequently floss hoes at Roscoe's

Only got five blunts left to light, I'm set tonight
Paid a visit to Versace stores

Bust on bitches be-lly, rub it in they tummy
Lick it, say it's yummy, then fuck yo' man

Or do you wanna see about seven digits
Fuck hoes exquisite, Cali, great place to visit I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali

When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the thriller in Manila
Honeys call me Bigga the condom filler
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the ep along by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with the dick, make your kidneys shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I'm in thirteens, know what I mean
I fuck around and hit you with the Hennessey dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder, it doesn't matter
Skinny or fat or boy-skinned or black, baby I drop
These boricua mommies screamin "Ay papi!"
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled propa
Look, I gotcha caught up in the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote da fo'-fo'
For niggaz gettin mad cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G ya see
All I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Gettin Physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So gimme a hoe, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her till her nose bleed
Even if your new man's a certified mack
You'll get that H-town in ya, you'll want that old thing back
What you wanna do?
I got that old thing back
What you wanna see?
Baby sing relax and feel
What you be, where you are
You wouldn't start
Bitches screamin they want That old thing back
Like B I Double G I E

Notorious known to bustin in ya E-Y-E, baby baby!
Bitches know they love and hate me
I come, you come, we come, with back some maybe

How come you ain't,?? semi your faces
When I come you be cryin like I'm killin ya bitches
Knows when picture in the camera rollin
Cause I only be knowin how the shit's unfolded
Back shots to the rear, got the mac unloaded
Got a reload, like every so often
You sayin I got my swagger back
I'm lookin like bitch, my swagger never left
It's so hard pressed, to be impressed by these new rappers
They actors, and the fact is, you want that old thing back
Shit...
Is my mind playin tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, havin nightmares of girls killin me
She mad because what we had didn't last
I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past let's dwell on the 500 SL, the E and J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rim with Benjamins
Another hon's in the crib, please send her in
I fuck nonstop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits alot
But lickin clits had to stop
Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow, really though
I got the cleanest meanest penis, ya never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Tim boots and your bodysuit
I mean the spandex and hit my man next
Sex gettin rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don't chase em, I replace em
and if I'm caressin em, I'm undressin em
Fuck whatcha heard who's the best in New York
For fillin fantasies without that nigga Mr. Walk
Or Tattoo I got you wrapped around my dick
And when I'm done I got to split shit
Back shots is my position, I gotcha wishin for an intermission

(Big) Here's another one
(Dad) And another one
(Big) And another one
(Dad) And another one
(Big) Uhh, what, what? Intro/Chorus: R. Kelly, Biggie (variations on Big's part) You must be used to me spendin
And all that sweet winin and dinin
Well I'm fuckin you tonight (Big) Here's another one
And another one
Uhh, uhh, what? Verse One: Notorious B.I.G. Some say the x, make the sex
Spec-tacular, make me lick you from yo neck
To yo back, then ya, shiverin, tongue deliverin
Chills up that spine, that ass is mine
Skip the wine and the candlelight, no Cristal tonight
If its alright with you, we fuckin (that's alright)
Deja vu, the blunts sparked, finger fuckin in the park
Pissy off Bacardi Dark
Remember when I used to play between yo legs
You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head
Straight to yo mother's bed
At the Mariott, we be lucky if we find a spot
Next to yo sister, damn I really missed the
way she used to rub my back, when I hit that
Way she used to giggle when yo ass would wiggle
Now I know you used to sweets at the Parker Meridian
Trips to the Carribean, but tonight, no ends Chorus 2X Verse Two: Notorious B.I.G. Girl you look fine, like a windface Rolex, you just shine
I like that waistline
Let me hit that from behind, which wall you wanna climb
My styles genuine, girl I love you long time
I got you pinned up, with yo fuckin limbs up
All because you like the way my Benz was rimmed up
Bitch keep yo shin up, please watch me do thee
Nasty, like it when you make it move fast mommy
I like it when you tro' it pon me
No love makin, strictly back breakin
Ceas' know, all his hoes, go to my door
Then they go to his flo', to fuck some more
So no, caviar, sharp bar, uh uh
Strictly sex that's pretty and left over spaghetti
I know you used to slow CD's and Don P's
But tonight its eight tracks and six-packs while I hit that Chorus 2X Verse Three: R. Kelly Lets stop the bullshit baby
Let me take you to the spot, get you hot
So you wanna be with me, Puff Daddy
B.I.G., bring that ass to me Chorus: repeat to fade with variations I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front do'
I'm living everyday like a hustle
Another drug to juggle, another day another struggle I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front do'
I'm living everyday like a hustle Another drug to juggle, another day another struggle I know how it feels to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell People look at you like you're the user
Selling drugs to all the losers mad Buddha abuser
But they don't know about the stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay That's why you drink Tanqueray
So you can reminisce and wish
You wasn't living so devilish s-shit
I remember I was just like you Smoking blunts with my crew
Flipping oldies 62's
'Cause G-E-D was it B-I-G, I got P-A-I-D
That's why my mom hates me She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out Nick's went for twenty down south
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves Four drunks trying to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't trying to hear it Smoking mad Newports 'cause I'm doing court for an assault
That I caught in Bridge Port, New York
Catch me if you can like the ginger bread man
You better have your gat in hand 'Cause man I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knocking in my front do' I'm living everyday like a hustle
Another drug to juggle, another day another struggle I had the master plan
I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland With my man Tutex to take over this projects
They call him Tutex, he tote two techs
And when he starts to bust
He likes to ask who's next? I got my honies on the Amtrack
With the crack in the crack of her ass
Two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hun to make some quick cash I told her she could be lieutenant bitch got gassed
At last I'm literally lounging Black,
Seating back counting double digit thousands stacks
Had to re-up see what's up with my peeps Toyota dealer cars had it cheap on the jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead with six to the head
Then I got the phone call It couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated
Like Nino at the Carter
I heard Tec got murdered in a town I've never heard of By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch
I told her where she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy should be home in three Until them I look south for the home family
A true G, that's me blowing like a bubble
In the everyday struggle I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knocking in my front do'
I'm living everyday like a hustle
Another drug to juggle, another day another struggle I'm seeing body after body and our mayor Giuliani
Ain't trying to see no black man turn into John Gotti
My daughter use a potty so she's older now
Educated street knowledge I'm gonna mold 'er now
Trick 'er little dope buying young girls tringes Dealing with the dope fiend binges
Seeing syringes in the veins
Hard to explain how I maintain
The crack smoke makes my brain feel so strange
Breaking days on the set no sweat from cold moet
Can't bag yet because's still wet
But when I dry back in five at a time
I can clock about nine on the check cashing line
I had to burst on the third
Rehearse that's my word
Thinking the game Ds knew my first name
Should I quit? Shit no!
Even though they had me scared
Yo they gotta eight I gotta teck with air holes That's just how the shit goes in the struggle mother fucker I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knocking in my front do'
I'm living everyday like a hustle
Another drug to juggle, another day another struggle Uhh, it's the ten crack commandments
What, uhh, uhh
Nigga can't tell me nothin bout this coke, uh-huh
Can't tell me nothin bout this crack, this weed
To my hustlin niggaz
Niggaz on the corner I ain't forget you niggaz
My triple beam niggaz, word up (Chuck D) "One two three four five six seven eight nine" "TEN"j I been in this game for years, it made me a animal
It's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual
A step by step booklet for you to get
your game on track, not your wig pushed back
Rule nombre uno: never let no one know
how much, dough you hold, cause you know
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially
if that man fucked up, get your ass stuck up
Number two: never let em know your next move
Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence or violence
Take it from your highness (uh-huh)
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips
Number three: never trust no-bo-dy
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up
Hoodie to mask up, shit, for that fast buck
she be layin in the bushes to light that ass up
Number four: know you heard this before
Never get high, on your own supply
Number five: never sell no crack where you rest at
I don't care if they want a ounce, tell em bounce
Number six: that god damn credit, dead it
You think a crackhead payin you back, shit forget it
Seven: this rule is so underrated
Keep your family and business completely seperated
Money and blood don't mix like two dicks and no bitch
Find yourself in serious shit
Number eight: never keep no weight on you
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jobs too
Number nine shoulda been number one to me
If you ain't gettin bags stay the fuck from police (uh-huh)
If niggaz think you snitchin ain't tryin listen
They be sittin in your kitchen, waitin to start hittin
Number ten: a strong word called consignment
Strictly for live men, not for freshmen
If you ain't got the clientele say hell no
Cause they gon want they money rain sleet hail snow
Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up
If not, twenty-four years, on the wake up
Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up
Caretaker did your makeup, when you pass
Your girl fucked my man Jake up, heard in three weeks
she sniffed a whole half of cake up Heard she suck a good dick, and can a steak up
Gotta go gotta go, more pasta bake up, word up, uhh Crack king, Frank Blizzard
Uhh (Chuck D) "One two three four five six seven eight nine"

A open casket on them bastards so they all remember me
With my vest on my chest, my tools and my piece
Thug Life motherfucker gotta me runnin' from the *police* Nigga, you know that's true
Catch a nigga like K-Dog, chillin wit a crew
Every damn day parlay with my glass of Re
The O.J. and it's all OK
'til that fuckin fake cop got to play the man
Ran me down the block with my glass in my hand
Damn, I hope it don't spill
Nigga chill, shit is real cock back my steel Still runnin' from the police I gets no sleep
I got you peepin in my window while I'm smokin indo
But I ain't no motherfuckin track star, pig's got a Jeep

So I, grabs my piece before I flee
And instead of me runnin', these bitches is runnin' from me
Lick shots hits spots off on my piece
Cause a nigga like Big Mouth is through runnin' from the police Interlude: Don Gargon ? (this is a very rough guess) I bust off! What about the time they pull me from the Bronco
lay, they tried to cock me, but them can't gun store
When a batty bwoy do it from the mob
Ahh, pull up your pants then you screw an left squad
Look around, look around, punk police
While gwan man doesn't a come but a bad boy test
Look around, look around, punk police
Me hafta blast back, cause de blast is best Verse Two: Stretch, Notorious B.I.G. Yo I was, schemin and fiendin for loots and took the crooked route
to, ghetto fame I felt the pains and now I run the game
The insane brain, cold gettin fly like a plane
on them suckers with my nigga Biggie Smalls causin ruckus Check it, I grew up a fuckin screwup
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin blew up
Choppin rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryin ta turn into the black Frank White And we got the workers choppin rock, Benz by the flock
And we gettin it, the dirty cops are jealous so they sweatin it
I'm lettin off smoke, hope they don't play me for no joke
and provoke the homicide, so just let the drama slide
We keepin it real, fuck how you feel, Biggie pass the steel
Let's serve these motherfuckers slugs as a fuckin meal We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops on the milk box missin
Show they toes you know they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police picture that, nigga I'm too fat
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack (*heavy breathing*)
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me
When he drop, take his glock, and I'm Swayze
Summer break, my escape, sold the glock, bought some weight
Laid back, I got some money to make, motherfucker Interlude: Don Gargon ? (again this is a very rough guess) Now it's war, me tryin to sell, runnin from the punk po-lice
They try to cock me, but them can't gun store
What about they come to hold up me North
Pulled up the park, I left school and left buck
Look around, look around, punk police
Was about to blast with ya gun but you can't stop me
Look around, look around, punk police
Me haf to blast back, cause blast back best Verse Three: 2Pac They got me runnin' from the five-oh
duckin and dodgin in my survival
The Benzo and I let off with my nine, hoe
I'm movin swifter than the next nigga, no time for sex
Cause in my mind all I wonder is who's next
Nigga, my homey slipped and now he pays the price
He did a driveby, sixteen, now he's doin triple life
Tell me is it me or my upbringin
I split that dove shit
Nigga motherfuck singin, I hope you got your Timberlands
on tight, cause I ain't givin up
I'd rather duck these motherfuckers all night
I'm runnin' through the projects, beyotch
They'll never catch me
Cause I'm loc'd and trigger happy on the, sneotch
Don't say you never heard of me, til they murder me, I'm a legend
Do Thug Niggas go to heaven?
I'm rollin with the thorough heads
We gettin ghost on them hoes and yo
I got no love for the five-oh I'm runnin' from the police Outro: Don Gargon ? to fade Yeah. motherfuckers better know... huh, huh. lock your windows,
Close your doors. biggie smalls, huh... yeah. My man inf left a tec and a nine at my crib
Turned himself in, he had to do a bid
A one-to-three, he be home the end of '93
I'm ready to get this paper, g, you with me? Motherfucking right, my pocket's looking kind of tight
And I'm stressed, yo biggie let me get the vest No need for that, just grab the fucking gat
The first pocket that's fat the tec is to his back
Word is bond, I'm a smoke him yo don't fake no moves (what?)
Treat it like boxing: stick and move, stick and move Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit
I've been robbin motherfuckers since the slave ships
With the same clip and the same four-five
Two point-blank, a motherfucker's sure to die
That's my word, nigga even try to bogart
Have his mother singing it's so hard... Yes, love love you're fucking attitude
Because the nigga play pussy that's the nigga that's getting screwed
And bruised up from the pistol whipping
Webs on the neck from the necklace stripping
Then I'm dipping up the block and I'm robbing bitches too
Up the herring bones and bamboos
I wouldn't give fuck if you're pregnant
Give me the baby rings and a #1 mom pendant I'm slamming niggaz like shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal I rob and steal
'cos mom duke ain't giving me shit
So for the bread and butter I leave niggaz in the gutter
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fucking angel dust
When I bust my gat motherfuckers take dirt naps
I'm all that and a dime sack, where the paper at? Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
And I'm shooting niggaz quick if you hiccup
Don't let me fill my clip up in your back and head piece
The opposite of peace sending mom duke a wreath
You're talking to the robbery expert
Stepping to your wake with your blood on my shirt
Don't be a jerk and get smoked over being resistant
'cos when I lick shots the shits is persistent Huh, goodness gracious the papers
Where the cash at? where the stash at?
Nigga, pass that before you get your grave dug
From the main thug, .357 slug
And my nigga biggie got an itchy one grip One in the chamber, 32 in the clip
Motherfuckers better strip, yeah nigga peel
Before you find out how blue steel feel From the beretta, putting all the holes in your sweater
The money getter motherfuckers don't have better
Rolex watches and colourful swatches
I'm digging in pockets, motherfuckers can't stop it Man, niggaz come through I'm taking high school rings too
Bitches get stripped down for they earrings and bangles
And when I rock her and drop her I'm taking her door knockers
And if she's resistant baka! baka! baka! So go get your man bitch he can get robbed too Tell him biggie took it, what the fuck he gonna do? I hope apologetic or I'm a have to set it
And if I set it the cocksucker won't forget it Man, listen all this walking is hurting my feet
But money looks sweet (where at?) in the isuzu jeep
Man, I throw him in the beem, you grab the fucking c.r.e.a.m
And if he start to scream bam! bam!, have a nice dream
Hold up, he got a fucking bitch in the car
Fur coats and diamonds, she thinks she a superstar
Ooh biggie, let me jack her, I kick her in the back
Hit her with the gat...
Yo chill, shorty, let me do that...
Just get the fucking car keys and cruise up the block
The bitch act shocked, gettin shot on the spot
(oh shit! the cops!) be cool, fool
They ain't gonna roll up, all they want is fucking doughnuts
(so why the fuck he keep lookin?) I guess to get his life tooken
I just came home, ain't trying to see central booking
Oh shit, now he lookin in my face
You better haul ass 'cos I ain't with no fucking chase
So lace up your boots, 'cos I'm about to shoot
A true motherfucker going out for the loot Mmmmmmmmm-hmm
See.
I told you.
see, I told y'all muh'fuckers yo yo. that stupid nigga man
i told y'all to stop!
he fucked up, yo.
i pray for you to stop
()time for u to die as i kiss yo ass goodnight
yo, yo yo yo, yo. yo. yo.
Yo, yo yo yo, yo.
but no, you didn't stop
yo. yo. and now, we won't stop sung by notorious b.i.g. (repeat 2x) Time, time for you to die
As I kiss. yo'. ass. goodnight I make yo' mouthpiece obese like della reese
When I release, you loose teeth like lil' cease
Nigga please, blood floods yo' dungarees
And that's just the half on my warpath
Laugh now cry later, I rhyme greater
Than the average playa hater, and spectators
Buy my cd twice; they see me in the streets
They be like, yo he nice, but that's on the low doe
Be the cats with no dough, tried to play me at my show
I pull out fo'-fo's, and go up in they clothes
Short-change niggaz, snort-caine niggaz
Extortion came quicker, bought the range nigga
Ya still tickle me, I used to be as strong as ripple be
Til lil' cease crippled me
Now I play hard, like my girls nipples be
The game sour like like a pickle be, y'all know da rules
Move from bk to new jeruz -- thinkin bout
All the planes we flew, bitches, we ran through
Now the year's new, I lay my game flat
I want my spot back, take two
Motherfuckers mad cause I blew, niggaz envious
Too many niggaz on my dick, shit strenuous
When my men bust, you just move wit such stamina
Slugs missed ya, I ain't mad at cha (we ain't mad at cha)
Blood rushin, concussions, ain't nothin
Catch cases, come out frontin, smokin somethin
Sippin white russians, bitch in the benz bumpin
I laced it wit the basic, six tv's a system
Knockin mase shit, face it, we hard to hit Guard ya shit, 'fore I stick you, for your re-up Wipe the pee up, mixed shots, woke your seed up
Go in the ashtray, spark the weed up, long kiss {puff daddy - speaking over }
Now. we don't give a fuck.
We just absolutely. don't give a fuck.
Because. there ain't no motherfuckin love here.
There ain't no love here. You know, we. we just gon' keep doin what we do
We gon' keep fuckin you up.
And i'ma keep stompin your motherfuckin head in
You fuckin bitch, c'mon!
{last line overlaps biggie's next verse} Uhh. I'm flamin gats, aimin at, these fuckin
Maniacs, put my name in raps, what part the
Game is that? like they hustle backwards
I smoke blackwoods and dutchies, ya can't touch me
Try to rush me, slugs go, touchy-touchy
You're bleedin lovely, wit'chyo, spirit above me
Or beneath me, your whole life you live sneaky
Now you rest eternally, sleepy, you burn when you creep me
Rest where the worms and the weak be
My nine flies, baptize, rap guys
With the holy ghost, I put holes in most You hold your toast shaky, slippin tryin to break me Look what you made me do, brains blew
My team in the marine-blue, six coupe
Skied it out, weeded out, cleanin out -- the block
For distances, givin long kisses bitch {puff daddy - speaking over }
All we have to do now. is say a prayer for you. y'know? That's all we have to do, just to pray for your mind. cause.
Eheh, see your mind got control of your heart.
When it's supposed to be the other way around
Your heart's supposed to got control of your mind.
So now, I have no feelings for you
You have made me cold.
{last line overlaps biggie's next verse} Frank white the menacin, chron chron's the medicine
I got the lettuce and, you turn green like cucumber skin
Got the new, hummer in the summer when I was a new comer
Then, drugs and mac-10's
Hugs from fake friends, make ends they hate you
Be broke -- girls won't date you
That's why I relate to, choke yo' ass out til your face blue
Make you, open the safe too
No matter how you call it (how you call it)
This brolic, alcoholic . Like his weed green'd out, like his brick solid Distribute to, kids who, take heart like valentine
Drink ballentine, all the time
Slugs hit your chest tap you spine, flatline
Heard through the grapevine, you got fucked fo' times
Damn that three to nine, fucked you up for real doe
Sling steal slow, as for remorse, we feel no {puff daddy - speaking over }
See the fucked up thing is that I love you.
Yaknahmsayin?
It's just in my nature to love you.
I can't hate you. cause it's not in my nature to hate you.
You know, I don't know.
Maybe. I'm a different type of individual.
But. you have me on the line.
And there's a thin line between love and hate
And God forbid I cross that line.
Cause y'all not gonna give a fuck
I'm tellin you right, motherfuckin, now!
The shit, y'all done started, is never gonna stop!
We are never gonna stop!
And we not talkin bout. no other rappers.
We talkin bout you motherfucker
You know, who I'm talkin to.
We comin for you.
We comin for you. ehehehehheh
The shit's gon' feel so good.
I'm gon' make you love me baby Who the fuck is this?
Pagin me at 5: 46 in the mornin crack a dawnin
Now I'm yawnin, wipe the cold out my eye
See who's this pagin me and why.
It's my nigga pop from the barbershop

Call the coroner
There's gonna be alot of slow singin
And flower bringin
If my burgular alarm starts ringin
Whatcha think all the guns is for?
All purpose war got the rottweilers by the door
And I feed em gun powder so they can devour
The criminals tryin to drop my decimals
Damn. niggaz wanna stick my for my c.r.e.a.m.
And in a dream things ain't always how it seems
It's the ones that smoke blunts witcha
See your picture, now they wanna
Grab they guns and come and getcha
Betcha biggie won't slip
I got the calico with the black talions loaded in the clip
So I can rip through the ligaments
Put they bodies in a bad prediciment
Where all the foul niggas went
Touch my cheddar, feel my beretta
Buck with what I had you with
You motherfuckers betta duck
I leave stains on blood of what remains
Had to jack-it, he had a gun he should've packed it
Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket
So I can reload and explode down ya rasshole
I fuck around and get hardcore, c-4 to ya door no beef no more
Feel the rush, scandalous
The more weed smoke I puff, the more dangerous
I don't give a fuck about you or your weak crew
What you gonna do when big poppa comes for you
I'm not runnin, nigga I bust my gun in
Hold on I hear somebody comin... The Biggie Duets! (Uhh!)
Jazzy Fizzle, Jagged Edge (Biggie Smalls)

Left the club tipsy, say no mo'
Except how I'm gettin home, tomorrow

Back of my mind I hope she swallow
Man she spilled a drink on my cream Wallows
Reach the gate, hungry just ate
Riffin, she got to be to work by eight
This must mean she ain't tryin to wait
Conversate, sex on the first date

She starts off, "But I don't usually" (let's go)
Then I, whipped it out, rubber no doubt
Step out, show me what you all about
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse

Made women wantin'to bone Sean Combs, sippin' on patron
Speedin' be leanin' got' 'em feenin'

(you ready motherfucker?)
(we gon' kill your ass) As I grab the glock, put it to your headpiece
One in the chamber, the safety is off release
Straight at your dome homes, I wanna see cabbage
Biggie smalls the savage, doin your brain cells much damage
Teflon is the material for the imperial
Mic ripper girl stripper the henny sipper
I drop lyrics off and on like a lightswitch
Quick to grab the right bitch and make her drive
The q-45, glocks and tecs are expected when I wreck shit
Respect is collected, so check it
I got techniques drippin out my buttcheeks
Sleep on my stomach so I don't fuck up my sheets, huh
My shit is deep, deeper than my grave g
I'm ready to die and nobody can save me
Fuck the world, fuck my moms and my girl
My life is played out like a jheri curl, I'm ready to die As I sit back and look when I used to be a crook
Doin whatever it took from snatchin chains to pocketbooks
A big bad motherfucker on the wrong road
I got some drugs tried to get the avenue sold
I want it all from the rolexes
To the lexus gettin paid, is all I expected
My mother didn't give me what I want, what the fuck?
Now I got a glock, makin motherfuckers duck
Shit is real, and hungry's how I feel
I rob and steal because that money got that whip appeal
Kickin niggaz down the steps just for rep
Any repercussion lead to niggaz gettin wet
The infrared's at your head real steady
You better grab your guns cause I'm ready, ready I'm ready to die!
(nah we ain't gon' kill your ass yet)
(we gonna make you suffer) In a sec I throw the tec to your fuckin neck
Everybody hit the deck, biggie bout to get some wreck
Quick to leave you in a coffin, for slick talkin
You better act like cece, and keep on walkin
When I hit ya, I split ya to the white meat
You swung on like you slumber right you fell to the conrete
Your face, my feet, they meet, we're stompin
I'm rippin mc's from tallahassee, to compton
Biggie smalls on a higher plane
Niggaz say I'm strange deranged because I put the 12 gauge to your brain
Make your shit splatter
Mix the blood like batter then my pocket gets fatter
After the hit, leave you on the street with your neck split
Down your backbone to where your motherfuckin cheek drip
The shit I kick, rip it through the vest
Biggie smalls passin any test, I'm ready to die! I'm ready
(time to go, we gonna put you out your misery motherfucker)
Niggaz definitely know what time it is
The notorious one in full effect
For ninety-three!
Suicidal, I'm ready! (now I lay me down to sleep)
Yeah
(pray the lord my soul to keep)
(if I should die before I wake)
(I pray the lord my soul to take)
(cause I'm ready to die) (all y'all motherfuckers come with me if you want to) (biggie smalls the biggest man)
(rockin on and on in ninety-three, easy mo bee)
(third eye, and the rest of the bad boy fam)
(I don't wanna see no cryin at my funeral) Throw your hands in the sky, nigga
I'm stickin' ice picks on the tip of ya dick
Give your testicles a swift kick, ain't that some shit?
Am I hard hard core, harder than a Plymouth
It ain't no myth, it's a nigga with the spliff
And a chrome four fifth pressed on ya back
So what you want, nigga? How you wanna act?
I hope civilized cause I love to see niggaz die
Brains all leakin' out on the street
And the pastor preachin' "He was a good man"
Played the bad man when the burner was in his hand
Now he's singin' sad songs with Elvis
Three to the head, bout six cross the pelvis
Ya fuck with the high guy ya die
Yeah the same motherfucker yellin' "Look up in the sky!"
I'm on some old neck shit, Suplex shit, hardcore sex shit, and Tec shit What you want, nigga? (What you want, nigga? What you, what you want nigga?
What you want, nigga? What you, what you want nigga? A repetitive loop
All I need to destroy a soloist or group
Huh, I put it to ya boy
Hope you got the scoop
I keep the glock by the penis, the cleanest cut
Fuck the sluts with the big humongous butts
Huh, I use a rubber, but
My style is gushy like the hooker's pussy
And it don't take a lot of back talk to push me Into flamin' 'em like that little nigga Damien
Pop 19 to my motherfuckin' cranium Game tight, gun totin' motherfucker
Niggaz in the grave thought Biggie was a sucker
I tricked 'em- I gave 'em work then I sticked 'em I stripped 'em, cause niggaz don't want the friction
Told you before how I bring the dra-ma
Slam Larry Johnson and his Grandma-ma What you want, nigga?
(What you want, nigga? What you, what you want nigga?
What you want, nigga? What you, what you want nigga? Aye yo
Time to bring 'em back

It's a Saturday and Biggie ain't got nuttin to do
Uhh, I'm intrrupted by a phone ring
Sometimes I wish I never got the motherf-ckin thing
"Hello hello? Can I speak to Biggie?"
Yo who dis? "Taisha" Yo call back, I'm busy
Why don'tcha hit me on the box a little later
Washed up, got dressed, hits the elevator
Steps out it's the same old scene
Dopefiend, crackfiend, eyewitness news team
I seen a honey with a butt lookin butter soft
I know she looks much better with them clothes up off
Sittin all thick, with the ruby red lipstick
That's the one I gotta get with [Chorus - Biggie Smalls]
Can I get wit'cha, can I get wit'cha
Can I get wit'cha, can I get wit'cha
"Why you wanna get with me?"
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T, see

I'm tryna get with ya girl, I aint even goin' stunt
Miss Fat booty, man I seen it from the front

And that ass was right, shit would make a fag look twice
So I approach like "shawty, whats good with cha?"
N-gga was hopin' to go back to the hood with ya
And yeah I see them other n-ggas tryna look at cha

(Y'all know what it is)
(Shit, I don't want no beef, ahaaa!) Verse one: Live from bedford-stuyverson, the livest one
Representin bk to the fullest
Gats I pull it, bastards duckin when big be buckin
Chickenheads be cluckin in my bathroom fuckin
It ain't nuttin, they know big be handlin
With the mac in the ac' door paneling
Bandaging mc's, oxygen they can't breathe
Mad tricks up the sleeve, red boxers so my dick can breathe
Breeze through in the q-45 by my side, lyrical high
And those that rushes my cluthes get put on crutches
Get smoked like dutches from the master
Hate to blast ya, but I have ta, you see I smoke a lot
Your life is played out like kwame, and them fuckin polka dots
Who rock the spot? biggie!
You know how the weed yo, unbelievable Verse two: B-i-g, g-i-e, aka, b.i.g.
Get it? biggie
Also known as the bon appetit
Rappers can't sleep need sleepin big keep creepin
Bulelts heat-seekin, casualties need treatin
Dumb rappers need teachin
Lesson a - don't fuck with b-i, that's that, oh i, thought he was wack
Oh come come now, why y'all so dumb now
Hunt me or be hunted, three hundred and fifty-seven ways
To summer sautee, I'm the winner all day
Lights get dimmer down biggie's hallway
My forte causes caucausians to say
He sounds demented, car-weed scented
If I said it, I meant it
Bite my tongue for no-one
Call me evil, or unbelievable Verse three: Buck shots out the sun roof of lexus coupe's
Leave no witnesses, what you think this is
Ain't no amateurs here, I damage and tear
Mc's fear me, they too near not to hear me
Clearly, I'm the triple beam dream
One thousand grams of uncut to the gut
It seems fucked up, the way I touched up the grill
Tryin to play gorilla, when you ain't no killer
The gat's by your liver, your upper lip quiver
Get ready to die, tell God I said hi
And throw down some ice, for the nicest mc
Niggaz know the steelo, unbelievable As I sit back relax
Steam a blunt, sip a Becks
Think about the sexy singers that I wanna sex I'd probably go to jail
For fuckin' Patti Labelle
Ooh Regina Belle, she'd probably do me swell
Jasmine Guy was fly
Mariah Carey's kinda scary
Wait a minute, what about my honey Mary?
The jeans they fittin' like a glove
I had a crush on you since Real Love
Hold your horses
I'mma show ya who the boss of intercourse is
Sex, I'm takin' no losses
Even groups like SWV and TLC
Can't see B.I.G. wit telepathy
The recipe of picture hardcore wit a gun
Pimpin' aint easy but it Sure is fun
When I bust my nuts
I bust 'em one by one
So what's the 4-1-1 hun? Dreams of fuckin' an R&B; bitch

Did Raven Simone call date rape?
Only 'cause Im paid
I'm fuckin' all of Jade
And my DJ Zhane she likes it when they say
Everybody... move your body
Got Whitney Houson boostin' from Bobby

Smacked Tina Turner give her flashbacks of Ike

Yo let, let, let me ask you a question yo
Yo would you kill for me?
(Girl)
Hmmm... yeah
(Puff Daddy)
What took you so long to answer motherf*cker?
(Girl)
I don't know
(Puff Daddy)
The f*ck wrong with you b*tch? Verse One: Notorious B.I.G. When I met you I admit my first thoughts was to trick
You look so good huh, I suck on your daddy's d*ck (yeah)
I never felt that way in my life
It didn't take long before I made you my wife (uh, yeah)
Got no rings and sh*t, just my main squeeze
Come into the crib, even had a set a keys
During the days you helped me bag up my nickels
In the process, I admit, I tricked a little (yeah)
But you was my b*tch, the one who'd never snitch (uhh)
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy f*ckin rich
And I admit, when the time is right, the wine is right
I treat you right, you talk slick, I beat you right Chorus: Notorious B.I.G. Just me and my b*tch (variations repeat to next verse) (Girl)
But you know you love that a$$, don't you?
(Puff Daddy)
Yeah, no question
(Girl)
No question
(Puff Daddy)
Yo, let me ask you another question
(Girl)
What?
(Puff Daddy)
You ever f*ck around on me?
(Girl)
Why would I do that?
(Puff Daddy)
Yo don't lie to me motherf*cker Verse Two: Notorious B.I.G. Moonlight strolls with the hoes, oh no, that's not my steelo
I wanna b*tch that like to play celo, and craps
Packin gats, in a Coach bag steamin dime bags
A real b*tch is all I want, all I ever had (yeah, c'mon)
With a glock just as strong as me
Totin guns just as long as me, the b*tch belongs with me
Any plans with another b*tch, my b*tch'll spoil it
One day, she used my toothbrush to clean the toilet (that's nasty)
Throwin my clothes out the windows, so when the wind blows
I see my Polos and Timbos
Hide my car keys so I can't leave
A real slick b*tch, keep a trick up her sleeve
And if I deceive, she won't take it lightly
She'll invite me, politely, to fight G
And then we lie together, cry together
I swear to God I hope we f*ckin die together Chorus (Girl)
Let me tell you nigga, if I ever, ever catch your a$$ f*ckin around
I'ma cut your mother-f*ckin d*ck off
(Puff Daddy)
Hah, heheh stop playin, hah
(Girl)
I ain't playin, ain't no jokes, ain't no jokes
Ain't no jokes
(Puff Daddy)
Yo, don't don't play with my d*ck Verse Three: Notorious B.I.G. She helped me plan out my robberies on my enemies
Didn't hesitate to squeeze, to get my life out of danger (yeah)
One day, she put nine one one on the page
Had to call back, whether it's minor or major (yeah)
No response, the phone just rung
Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem
When I pulled up, police was on the scene
Had to make the U-turn, make sure my sh*t was clean
Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes
Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
It didn't take long before the tears start
I saw my b*tch dead with the gunshot to the heart
And I know it was meant for me
I guess the niggaz felt they had to kill the closest one to me (uh, yeah)
And when I find em your life is to and end
They killed my best friend... me and my b*tch Chorus Uh, yeah, yeah
Uh...
Uh, motherf*cker yeah Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet Do you ever ask yourself, when are they ever gonna stop?
Do you ever ask yourself, when are they gonna stop making those hits?
Do you ever ask yourself, when are they gonna stop making us dance?
Do you ever ask yourself
When those bad boy are gonna stop making all this money? I lick shots at intruders
Take the coke money and invest in computers
Tryin' to reach the next level, Rolex with the ice bezel
Coming through the ghetto, in a Porsche Carrero But for now I'll play the back of the cruiser
Light another sack for the three time losers
Pour out some beer, bust out the ruger
Ladies and gentleman Bullets will leave you tremblin'
Shooken up
I got my Cuban mommy cooking up
We got it all from Heron to Fishscale New York to Ismail get locked, I'm gettin' bail
My style is flashy like a fiver strobes
Going around the globe, hunnies wearing silk robes
Time to flip the script, bust the whip Legend with the chip, dark blue with my trunk dipped
To the feds, catch me if you can
I'm a still transport with my man on the Peter Pan
Get there and bury the bricks in the sand They think I want a tan, I'm sittin' on a hundred grand
So I can hit the boat and take a shower
Head back to the airport, and hide the money in the tower
Stack blocks by the keys, L to the O to the X you'll see Bad boy, bad boy, what you gonna do
What you gonna do when they come for you
(Gun cocking)
You'll see, you'll see
(Gun cocking) Bad boy, bad boy, what you gonna do

Flaavvaa Yeah aight then, you better act like you know
L to the O, X amount the flows
Ain't nothin' change but the range since I got the inf.
Dot on your head, take all your strength Yeah, I'm in it for the green
I'll get up in your seam while I'm sonning you like a nigga from Queens
My tape in your duel cassette running me
Tryin' to get in front of me playa, but you ain't gettin' none of me Better off gunnin' me, with hot slugs numbing me
'Cause you and I both know, the flow is coming B
When you want it? Now or later?
I get mine and slide like a fresh pair of 'gators With my mega click, involved in Montega bricks
Niggaz is mega sick, and you know we roll mega thick
Up north where they bust your man
In the custom van, interrupt your plans Now it's back to grams, damn, ain't that somethin'
All that for frontin', what you gonna do? Nothin'
So let's keep things rationalized
Everything I write better nationalize I'm into gettin' money, twistin' hunnies
Niggaz is buyin' coupes while you on the stoop lookin' funny
I'm a scorer, shorty love the whole aura
Pussy wasn't all that, that's why I never called her It's all about quick whips and fast knicks
Gats with mad clips, TV's in your whips
My style tight like Gotti when I touch you
Seasoned Picatti, or Versace joints with the buckle Get the facts, I'm tryin' to get the Beamer with the hatch
Cop one for my man, so ill shits match
Runnin' around all crazy twistin' hunnies back
And breakin' niggaz that come to gamble with small stacks
Really though, screw y'all, I never knew y'all
Your click be like yellow lights, I'm runnin' through y'all Bad boy, bad boy, what you gonna do
What you gonna do when they come for you
(Gun cocking)
You'll see, you'll see
(Gun cocking) Bad boy, bad boy, what you gonna do
What you gonna do when they come for you
(Gun cocking)
You'll see, you'll see
(Gun cocking) Yo, hard as it is to make a buck, I ain't tryin' to get stuck
So I'm a keep handlin' beef like I don't give a fuck
It's all about respect Tek-9's and papes
Big house in Italy, in the yard with hunnies crushin' grapes So I go down to my steam room and give a long prayer
Knowing that one day I'll be Sheek Luchion the mayor
Fatigued out in my house or office
Blunt spots and crooked cops can't grow shit so the town supports this
(Uh-hun) My staff rollin' in Jags, Cruisers, and Coupes
Givin' rallies, and holdin' parades for the lifers groups
Now what you gon' do?
When they come for you The same thing you been doing
Eye screwing
And bubble gum chewing
(Whoh)
While me and my mans are pursuin' Who you think the ladies are enhancin'
Rocking Vansons, I'm dancing in the mansion
So cheers to life of the ice in your chains and your watches
And you'll see how we lock this Bad boy, bad boy, what you gonna do
What you gonna do when they come for you
(Gun cocking)

You'll see, you'll see
(Gun cocking) Click, click, uh, uh, uh
Niggaz talkin' it but ain't livin' it
Crystal pops I'm sippin' it, mob hats and lizard shit
'Gator trunks bitch, rollin' blunts with the williest of the Willy Hitchlin' cocked M-1's and nine millies
Stories like a motherfucker
(That's right)
Model bitches wondering if I'm a fuck with her
She know I treats my bitches like Ivana Dolce and Gabana
Dippin'
Big poppa never slippin'
H-class diamonds shinin' Dinner with the wifey winin', dinin'
Smoking cigars in Bogota
With Colombian niggaz named Panama
And Englique and shit Games we play life endin'
Bitches bending over with ease
For a pair of Moschino jeans
And Donna Karan tank tops I got your bank stopped Singles on top
Benjamins
Under the rest of 'em
Advancin' From duplex to mansion
Stashing keys hidin' G's overseas
VCR's in my V's
Game elevates, money I make Get's your stocks and real estates, bitch
Jet skiing in the Caribbean, white sands
Discussing plans with my mans
Dark blue land, smoke tint chrome rims and system That leaves your rear views tremblin'
What you gonna do when poppa catch an attitude
Drop to your knees and show gratitude
Kiss my rings it's a Frank White thing I stay potent
Bitch is devoted, take my dick and deep throat it You'll see, you'll see

Lean Back, Lean Back, Lean Back Verse 2:

Or some brand newbian shit beating down punks Chorus Verse 3:
B**ches in the back looking righteous
In a tight dress I think I might just
Hit her wit a little Biggie one-on-one

Conversation, blunts in rotation, ma men big Jock got the GLOCK in his waist and was smokin, drinking got the Hooker thinking
If money smell bad then this ni**a biggie's stinkin

She grabbed ma arm and said let's leave calm

Cant we just all get along?
So I can put hickeys on ya chest like lil' Shawn Chorus [Notorious B.I.G.]
Yo, check it

Nigga be snorin all night I can't sleep (hehe)
Call that big butt nurse with the long hair to come suck my dick
(Bad Boy Big, c'mon) The doctor said I need about three weeks of recovery
but the nurses is lovin me
Sayin the best part of the day is my half
Feedin me breakfast, and givin me a sponge bath
Niggaz say I died dead in the streets
Nigga I'm gettin high, gettin head on the beach
Chillin, sittin on about half a million
With all my niggaz, all my guns, all my women
Next two years, I should see about a billion
All for the love of drug dealin
Got no love for the other side, fuck them tricks (fuck them)
Any repercussion, Junior M.A.F.I.A. spit clips (that's right)

Truck, necklace, igloo ring and things
For the bitches, who see them rims spin and grin
That shit with the V-trim that win
and the enormous fields disperse of rap
On the road to the riches more furs to drag
More niggaz to kill, than birds to bag
Hit the jeweler and splurge the tab, uh
Hops, out the truck like, "Trick, what up?"
Call me Sean if you suck, call me gone when I nut
That's the end of us, get your friend to fuck
Untwist and bend her up, you know the deal
Niggaz talkin real greasy on some ballin shit (that's right)
Funny how quick these pricks forget
Actin like I ain't the reason they traded they shit
Switched that 5, copped that 6 (that's right)

Then stay your ass home, you and your chaperone
Things done changed, but we continue to reign
as the King and the Queen of hip-hop, me and B.I.
Frank White still listen to all the (a)'ttention
I'm by his side, with the chrome fifth, playin my position
Sexy, young thing, from the ghetto
That bitch rockin mics in high heel stilletos
We takin over like Francis
Switchin our styles like the hottest new dancers

You cut that hooker off and find someone new
I need another bitch (another bitch), in my life Verse one: notorious b.i.g. Uh-huh, uhh, uhh
I know he don't treat you like I treat you
Time to explain the game you see through
Sex is lethal, I ain't gon lie
Means to get ya back, I ain't gon try
Like this ya'll, my girl sucked anotha nigga dick y'all
Light skinned with the chrome die six y'all
Thought they was creepin, two trips to v-a every third weekend
While you was sleepin, he hit you on the box
Sixty-nine go non-stop
Shoulda left ya then, but my heart said not
You knew too much, the relationship grew too much
You knew about the crack vials, means to be trialed
Way I hid dough under the bathroom tile
Waited for a while, thought you was my right thing
Then things got frightening
Peep the scene, sorta like sam rothstein
Guess you ginger, huh, go figure
Never thought you could be a gold digger
Take my dough and spend with the next nigga
Asked my man trigga, my ace boom coon
Told me cut the bitch off 'fore the shit balloon
Now I'm like brandy, sittin in my room
Pissy drunk listenin to stylistic tunes
Or the o-jays, thinkin bout the old days
My nigga's like, fuck that bitch, go play
Baller, did she beep you? don't call her
Guess who I seen, that freak bitch paula
She was askin bout ya whereabouts
Here's the digits, I know you can wear that out
Tear that out the frame, ya game so tight
You'll be all fuckin night Chorus two: lil kim What do ya do when your man is untrue?
Do you cut the sucker off and find someone new?
I need another man, in my life Verse two: lil kim Mmm, uhhh, uhhh!
Member when you said you would die for me, shit
All of that was just lies to me
Motherfucker shoulda never said bye to me
Now you cry for me, like jodeci
It's like that y'all, my nigga hit another bitch from the back y'all
Black nasty and matter fact ya'll
Shoulda seen the hoe, nigga pack ya shit
You out the door, ohh
What about the fight in the mirage?
I seen ya benz, parked outside my sister's garage
Said it was ya friend rog, bullshit
I ain't gonna keep puttin up wit the bullshit
And still i, never sweat these bitches
Who be hanged like plaques on the wall and ya pictures
Scalin fishes, my love is concrete
Stashin ya heat in the passenger seat
Of the nautica jeep, we've been down for so long
Still a bitch like me tryin to hold on
Teary eyed, damn a bitch steamin
Girls steady screamin, 'kim you need to leave him!'
When I testified in court, couldn't think straight
Thinkin bout the bitches I fought
Over you, nigga half the shit you bought
And fuck you, movin is my last resort
You see nine outta ten niggaz, ain't shit
One outta five niggaz suck a dick
Ya mad at me, too bad she ain't as bad as me
Choulda kept the freak bitch off my canape
Now you see, ain't no pussy warm as mine
Long as mine, ain't no love as strong as this
When I sucked ya dick, it's like smokin a roach
Uhh, I go from first class to coach Chorus one, chorus two, chorus one, chorus two Notorious... Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat,

Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died When I die, fuck it I wanna go to (hell)
Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven wit' the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies
God will probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fuckin' abortion Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died I swear to God I just want to (slit) my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
And squeeze, until the bed's, completely red
I'm glad I'm (dead), a worthless fuckin' buddah head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't,
I can't believe (suicide's) on my fuckin' mind
I want to leave, I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
Naw you wouldn't understand
You see its kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back
Should I die on the train track, like Remo in Beatstreet
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone
She knew me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died I reach my peak, I can't speak,
call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak
I'm sick of niggaz lyin', I'm sick of bitches hawkin'
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin' Who y'all talkin to man?

We fucked in his bed, quite dangerous
I'm in his ass while he playin gainst the utah jazz
My 112, cd blast, I was past

She giggle, say I don't smoke it on homegrown
Then I heard her moan, honey I'm home
Yep, tote chrome for situations like this

Fuck around shit get dark to him, put a part through him

He go back downstairs more time to think
Her brain racing, she's tellin me to stay patient

Gat in hand, I don't wanna blast her man
But I can and I will doe, I probably chill doe
Even though situation lookin kinda ill yo
It came to me like a song I wrote
Told the bitch gimme your scarf, pillowcase and rope
Got dressed quick, tied the scarf around my face
Roped the bitch up, gagged her mouth with the pillowcase
Play the cut, nigga comin off some love potion shit
Flash the heat on em, he stood emotionless
Dropped the glass screamin, don't blast here's the stash,
A hundred cash just don't shoot my ass, please!
Nigga pullin mad g's out the floor
Put stacks in a prater knapsack, hit the door
Grab the keys to the five, call my niggaz on the cell
Bring some weed I got a story to tell, uhh... Yo man, y'all niggaz ain't gonna believe what the fuck happened to me.
Remember that bitch I left the club with man? yo, freaky yo. I'm up in

Motherfuckin money up in the prada knapsack. two words, I'm gone!

Some lye? *conversation fades out* So you wanna be hardcore
With your hat to the back
Talking about the gats in your raps
But I can't feel that hardcore Appeal that you're screaming
Maybe I'm dreaming
This ain't Christopher Williams, still some
MC's got to feel one Caps, I got to peel some
To let niggas know
That if you fuck with big-and-heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgie Says who - says me, the lyrical
Niggas saying: "Biggie off the street, it's a miracle!"
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me
Just for niggas acting shifty
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill you quicker Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor
Smoking blunts by the boxes, packing Glocks
It's natural to eat you niggas like chocolates
The funk, baby I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk

Used to sell crack, so I could stack my riches
Now I pack gats to stop all the snitches From staying in my business, what is this, relentless
Approach to know if I'm broke or not
Just cause I joke and smoke a lot
Don't mean I don't tote the Glock 16 shots for my niggas in the pen
Until we motherfucking meet again
I'm doing rhymes now, fuck the crimes now
Come on the ave, I'm real hard to find now
Cause I'm knee-deep in the beats In the Land Cruiser Jeep with the MAC-10 by the seats
For the jackers, the jealous-ass crackers in the blue suits
I'll make you prove that it's bulletproof
Hold your head, cause when you hit the bricks I got gin, mad blunts, and bitches sucking dick
The funk, baby I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk

I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk So I guess you know the story, the rap-side, crack-side
How I smoked funk, smacked bitches on the backside
Bed-Stuy: the place where my head rests
50-shot clip if a nigga want test The rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya
High as a motherfucking helicopter
That's why I pack a Nina, fuck a misdeameanor
Beating motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina
"What's love got to do"? When I'm ripping all through your whole crew
Strapped like Bamboo but I don't sling guns
I got bags of funk and it's selling by the tons
Niggas want to know how I live the mack life Making money, smoking mics like crack pipes
It's type simple and plain to maintain
I add a little funk to the brain
The funk, baby I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk

I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk Verse one: Remember back in the days, when niggaz had waves
Gazelle shades, and corn braids
Pitchin pennies, honies had the high top jellies
Shootin skelly, motherfuckers was all friendly
Loungin at the barbeques, drinkin brews
With the neighborhood crews, hangin on the avenues
Turn your pagers, to nineteen ninety three
Niggaz is gettin smoked g, believe me
Talk slick, you get your neck slit quick
Cause real street niggaz ain't havin that shit
Totin techs for rep, smokin blunts in the project
Hallways, shootin dice all day
Wait for niggaz to step up on some fightin shit
We get hype and shit and start lifin shit
So step away with your fist fight ways
Motherfucker this ain't back in the days, but you don't hear me though Verse two: No more cocoa leave-io, one two three
One two three, all of this to me, is a mystery
I hear you motherfuckers talk about it
But I stay seein bodies with the motherfuckin chalk around it
And I'm down with the shit too
For the stupid motherfuckers wanna try to use kung-fu
Instead of a mac-10 he tried scrappin
Slugs in his back and, that's what the fuck happens
When you sleep on the street
Little motherfuckers with heat, want ta leave a nigga six feet deep
And we comin to the wake
To make sure the cryin and commotion ain't a motherfuckin fake
Back in the days, our parents used to take care of us
Look at em now, they even fuckin scared of us
Callin the city for help because they can't maintain
Damn, shit done changed Verse three: If I wasn't in the rap game
I'd probably have a key knee deep in the crack game
Because the streets is a short stop
Either you're slingin crack rock or you got a wicked jumpshot
Shit, it's hard being young from the slums
Eatin five cent gums not knowin where your meals comin from
And now the shit's gettin crazier and major
Kids younger than me, they got the sky grand pagers
Goin outta town, blowin up
Six months later all the dead bodies showin up
It make me wanna grab the nine and the shottie
But I gotta go identify the body
Damn, what happened to the summertime cookouts?
Everytime I turn around a nigga gettin took out
Shit, my momma got cancer in her breast
Don't ask me why I'm motherfuckin stressed, things done changed To all my Brooklyn

On the avenue, take my loot and I'm baggin' you Pimpin' hoes that drive Volvo's and Rodeos
Flash the roll, make her wet, in her pantyhose

Watchin' the stash grow, clockin' the cash flow

The neighborhood grave digga gettin' paid so much
All the bitches wanna see a nigga
I guess they figure I'm paid, I wanna get laid
Or since I got loot I wanna knock boots I'd rather beat my dick than trick
And if she don't suck then we don't fuck
I'd rather make a buck, drive a fat-ass truck
Grab the 9, two clips, and run a muck
(Nigga, nigga, nigga)
Yes, flex at the two or three Benz's

D Rockafella
Caesar Leo Degenero
Bled C, Money SL B.I.G. is making this cream
Bitches always say what the hell does that mean?
B is for the bitches, who can't understand
How one fly nigga became a man I is for the way it goes in and out
One by one I knocks 'em out
G is for the way the game goes in the gutter Other MC's, man, they ain't sayin' nuthin'
Rockin' on to the break of dawn
Make the bitch give the pussy
Get the mouth, I'm gone What? It ain't no more to it Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil, for you are with me
Your rod and your staff, they comfort me
You prepare a table for me in the presence of my enemies
You anoint my head with oil, My cup overflows
Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever Niggaz in my faction don't like askin' questions
Strictly gun testin', Coke measurin'
Givin' pleasure in the Benz-ito
Hittin' fanny, spendin' chips at Manny's
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you up in your Polo sheets
Six up in your wig piece, nigga decease
Muah, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four and fifty-four draw
As my pilot steers my Lear, yes, my dear
Shit's official, only the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot cryin'
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin', no lyin'
So don't you get suspicious
I'm Big Dangerous, you're just a Lil Vicious
As I leave my competition respirator style
Climb the ladder to success escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all, death
Controls y'all, Big don't fold y'all
I spit phrases that'll thrill you You're nobody til somebody kills you You're nobody til somebody kills you
(I don't wanna die, God, tell me why)
You're nobody til somebody kills you
(I don't wanna die, God, tell me why) Watch Casino, I'm the hip-hop version
Of Nicky Tarantino, ask Nino, he know
Green with envy, the green tempts me
To make the rich the enemy and take their cheese
Take their spots, take their keys, make my faculty
Live happily ever after in laughter
Hah, never seen Cristal pour faster
And to those bastards, knuckleheads squeeze lead
Three of mine dead, nuttin' left to do
But tear they ass to shreds, leave 'em in bloodshed
Incidents like this, I take trips
Lay up in Miami with Tamika and Tammy
Some Creole C-O bitches I met on tour
Push a peach Legend Coupe, gold teeth galore
Told me, meet 'em in the future, later, they'll take me shoppin'
Buy me lavender and fuschia Gators
duce me to playa haters and heavy weighters
Rich bitch, shit, drinkin' Cristal til they piss the shit
Ahh
Thorough bitches, adapt to any borough bitches
Be in spots where they were no bitches, you feel me
Reminisce on dead friends too
You're nobody til somebody kills you You're nobody til somebody kills you (I don't wanna die, God, tell me why)
You're nobody til somebody kills you

You're nobody til somebody kills you
(I don't wanna die, God, tell me why) You could be the shit, flash the fattest five
Have the biggest dick but when your shell get hit
You ain't worth spit, just a memory
Remember, he used to push the champagne Range?
Silly cat, all suede in the rain Swear he put the G in Game, had the Gucci frame
Before Dana Dane, thought he ran with Kane
I can't recall his name
You mean that kid that nearly lost half his brain
Over two bricks of Cocaine?
Gettin' his dick sucked by Crackhead Lorraine
A fuckin' shame, Duke's a lame, what's his name?
Darkskin Jermaine, see, what I mean? You're nobody til somebody kills you
(I don't wanna die, God, tell me why)
You're nobody til somebody kills you
(I don't wanna die, God, tell me why)

Niggas say I'm pussy, I dare you to stick your dick in this
If I was pussy I'd be filled with syphilis
Herpes, gonorrhea, climittia, getting rid'a ya
Got it locked like the penatentury
Niggas mention me for MC execution
Who you choosin, the wack MC
Or the fat black MC
Jack Dempsey will start shaking
All it's taking, is some marijuana and I'm making
MCs break fast, like flap-jacks and bacon
Back spins, the windmills, who's still the gin-drinker
Ill-thinker, exploding when the paper hits the ink-ugh
Take the Gangster Chronicles, turn to page 6-6-6
Holocost, B.I.G. the merciless
Niggas press they luck-and
They get a butt-fuckin
Straight up the ass
Raw dog with the rash
And I don't fuck with the condoms
The condoms is a problem from the AIDS getting sprayed
Diseases, B.I.G. pleases
MCs across the seas is just the way, I crush my pray, hey
I'm crazy and deranged
Blowing niggas out the frame, simple and plain
But getting back, to the black, rhinocerisous rap
B.I.G. took a loss, hypopotheris is back, nigga Recognize
Notorious Biggie Smalls, '94 Ready To Die Good evenin' ladies and gentlemen
How's everybody doin' tonite?
I'd like to welcome to the stage, the lyrically acclaimed, ha
I like this young man, because, when he came out
He came out with the phrase, he went from ashy to classy
Ha, I like that
So everybody in the house, give a warm, round of applause for
The Notorious B.I.G. *clapping*
The Notorious B.I.G. ladies and gentlemen give it up for him ya'll
Uhhh A nigga never been as broke as me, (I like that)
When I was young I had two pair of Lees, (besides that)
The pin stripes and the gray (uh-huh)
The one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While niggas flirt, I'm sewing tigers on my shirt
And alligators
Ya wanna see the inside, huh, I see ya later
Here come the drama, oh, that's that nigga with the fake - blaow!
Why you punch me in my face? Stay in ya place
Play ya position, here come my intuition
Go in this nigga pocket
Rob him while his friends watchin'
and hoes clockin', here comes respect
His crew's your crew, or they might be next
Look at they man eye, BIG man they never try
So we roll wid 'em, stole wid 'em
I mean loyalty, niggaz bought me milks at lunch
The milks was chocolate, the cookies, buttercrunch
In gear - Oshkosh with blue and white dunks
Pass the blunt Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, pressin' what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want, have What you want, be what you want Uh-huh, I was ashamed, my crew was lame
I had enough heart for most of 'em
Long as I got stuff from most of 'em
It's on, even when I was wrong I got my point across
They depicted me the boss, of course
My orange box-cutter make the world go round
Plus I'm fuckin', bitches ain't my homegirls now
Start stackin', dabbled in crack, gun packin'
Nickname Medina, make the seniors tote my ninas
From gym class, to Englass, pass off a global
The only nigga with a mobile, can't you see like Total
Gettin' larger in waist and taste
Ain't no tellin' where this felon is headin', just in case
Keep a shell at the tip of ya melon, clear the space
Ya brain was a terrible thing ta waste
Eighty-eight long gates, snatch initial name plates
Smokin' spliffs wit niggaz, real life beginner killers
Prayin' God forgive us for being sinners, help us out Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, pressin what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want, have What you want, be what you want After realizin', to master enterprisin'
I ain't have ta be in school by ten, I was in
Began to encounter, with my counter-parts
On how ta burn the block apart, break it down into sections
Drugs by the selection
Some use pipes, others use injections
Syringe sold seperately, Frank the deputy
Quick to grab my Smith-n-Wesson, like my dick was missin'
To protect my position, my corner, my layer
While we out here, say the hustlas prayer
If the game shakes me or breaks me
I hope it makes me a better man
Take a better stand
Put money in my moms hand
Get my daughter this college plan, so she don't need no man
Stay far from timid
Only make moves when ya heart's in it
And live the phrase Sky's The Limit
Motherfucker... see you chumps on top Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have

harder than the planet
it ain't no miss it's a nigger with a spliff
and a chrome-fu fist pressed on yo back
so what you want nigga how you wanna act
I hope civilized cause I love to see niggas die
brains all leaking out on the street
and the pastor preaching: he was a good man
played the bad man when the burner was in his hand
now he's singing sad songs with Elvis
three to the head 'bout six cross the pelvis
you fuck with the high die you die
you're the same motherfucker
if you look up in the sky
I want some old nex shit
suplex shit hardcore section
protection a repetitive loop all I need to display
solo is the proof I put it to you boy
hope you got the scoop
biggie smalls the rap genius
I keep the glock by the penis
the cleanest cut fuck sluts
with the big humongous butts
I used to rub a butt
my style is Gucci like the hookers pussy
and it don't take a lot of black puff
to put me into flamin em
like that little nigga Damien
glock 19 to my mothafucking cranium
gang-thight gun toting motherfucker
niggas in they brains thought biggie was a sucker
I tricked em I gave me work then I snitched em
I stripped em cause niggas dont want the friction
told you before how I bring gun drama
playing Larry Johnson and his grand mama fuck around and feel the fury of a high nigga
when I get busy throw you hands in the sky nigga
I got the illest of the ill mentality niggas be grabbing me
knowing that they rather be stabbing me all up in my back
tryna take my track
when i used to sell crack I aint had problems like that
street rules watch your pockets and your jewels
a nigga front throw a gat to the fool
next one to move is getting blasted
streets to a flows from the ill gettho bastard
as I release master peace it's like indecent
stuck to your ass like tissue when you're wiping fast
mc's have a hard time believing
I'm marked with death hard to kill like steven
with jacob I'm leaving
The black man's motto: you got a better chance playing lotto [ Verse 1 ] [ Eminem ] It has been said, that there has been known to be blood shed
Over bread, men who have bled to death, dead
Strapped to beds, bite bombs dynamite lead
Money, power, respect, street cred, yeah
It's scary aint it? Picture yourself going out as a hero
Picth a Mural, pictures of us painted all over street corners
Fans meet to mourn us, while we meet the coroners
Notorious tried to warn us
So many piggy bank off of, Biggie's back and Pac's
Landmarks, history in rap, statistically in fact
It's so sad to see us re-enact
These tragic events, which lead us back
To where we left of March 9th to come from such hard knock lifes
And make it out of the bottom to hit the spotlights
Once the artist, this is our lives
Cast out for all eyes
And he who lasts the longest must be the strongest
In this concrete jungle
Where this dog eat dog mentality comes from
This origin, which is usually originated from cats are starving
Or it could just be somebodys aura that just horrifies
And applies to his persona or the sizes in his entourage
That intimidates the people to the point
You know that he's gangster, he aint gotta say shit you just believe it [ Verse 2 ] [ Obie Trice ] Since Big taught us niggas to think big
I'm been about my business since then so it aint Cheers
It aint how we live, it's what he said he did it for Brooklyn
This I took in, sent chills through my skin
Vicious, I've experienced in the same sights as him
It's what excited Obie to write these poems
Rolling, going through the same shit he spoken
Open up my eyes there's no limit in them skies
When Ready 2 Die was a sick part of my life
Pummin that .45, plotting to pop my mind
Then that crooked eye Jamaican, I'd so many times Rewind
Got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind
Get up out the system, who could give him better signs?
No pop of mine could top Big Poppas rhymes
So possibly I'd be popular huh?
That's the inspiration I got from my nigga P.I [ Verse 3 ] [ P Diddy ] I took a coal, a diamond, I moulded his mind, enter
The most phenomenal artist of any and all time
I made a Frankenstein, my designs impressed
Backpackers and press who said my house was a mess
Critics lash, said I made a fortune of his past an'
All is did was build a dynasty off of his passion
And I'm addressing the adolesence absent to who he is
The original king of New York Christopher Wallace
This is a promise on Diddy's honor
I'm a father to ya'll and teach ya with all the drama
Don't even bother, or repeat
All of your albums play back to back
And I visit your grave cause our friendships intact
An ammaculate concept, extravagant progress
Bullet wounds left in my heart, I'm yelling God bless
Regardless to critics yelling that 'east-west'
I seen the game loosing, I'm just pressing the reset
When the ressurection of you shines through an individual
Lyrical enough, doing the same crown of thorns literally
I'ma pay homage, brooklyns finest
Wether it's Queens or Harlem it'll be instant stardom, ni99a! To my motherfuckin' man, fifty grand, the alcholic man
Inject a tall can to his blood stream, if he can
Biggie Smalls, the pussy stroker
Emcee prover, the chocolate tah smoker (huh?)
I like to mack in Maximas and Acuras
Your girl's butt cheeks, I'm smackin' (huh?)
The raw rapper, spot smacker
Wit the lil hooker on my lap-ah, you know your favorite macker
A shy nigga, but I ain't ya fuckin' comforter
And If I ever fall in love, I better fuck wit her
Ask the hooker, If I didn't juk her
She try to front, then I put the Chucky Booker on her
(Why you wanna... play games on me?)
Bitch, you crazy? Commitments, I'm Swayze
No time for the ill shit
Mess with the niggaz on that real blood spill shit
My rappin' tactics, are drastic
Stretch these motherfuckers like Mr. Fantastic
So if you wanna see my Pedigree,
You better be filled with energy
Niggaz never gettin' me
Big cities and bright lights
Short days and long nights
No stress and no strife
I'm high off living the life
It's clear to see that I'm the motherfuckin' man,
I done learned from the best of em;
Took the first slot, niggaz still second guessin' em
Hoes, I'm undressin' em', foes, I'm not stressin' em'
Outlastin' a bunch of 'em, outflaw'd the rest of em'
Cuz everyday, I stay preachin' on the pulpit
So tell them haters they could miss me with that bull-shit
But I won't miss, I'm Luda, the heat holder
I'm rich, bitch! I've done more shows than Oprah
And I'm a soldier, ready for whatever
Roll with a bunch of niggaz that don't know no better
King like Coretta, countin' mo' cheddar
Just hired two dykes to be my ho getters
When it comes to these women, dog, ain't no one fuckin' wit me
They runnin' back, you think I had TJ Duckett wit me
That's cause I throw it like Vick, from the yard line
Menage a trois, it's safe to say I'm havin' hard times
To my nigga Chopper dot, with the whoopty-whop on the block
Got the heaters cocked, cause I know the suckers on the block
Hennesey and Belve-D, brings a lot of jealousy
Nigga stop snitchin', nephew, why you tellin' me?
They say the game ain't what it use to be no more
He used to be a G, but now he just a ho
Runnin' 'round poitin' fingers, tellin' names (snitch)
You fuckin' up the rules to this dirty game, it's a diry shame
I ain't flippin' out, that's probably why I'm dippin' out
Ya'll fools trippin' out, that why I'm on a different route
Now, makin' money, havin' clout, that's what it's all about
Twenty seven cars and a tweleve bedroom house
Now they call me Snoopy Trump
I keep my heater close, cause I love to bust
Now I susstain on a nigga, I bang on a nigga
Kick rocks and watch how I do my thang, young nigga; I'm livin' the life! Notorious B.I.G. F/ Beanie Siegal, Black Rob, Ice Cube

If I Should Die Before I Wake
[Notorious B.I.G.]
Uhh. UHH
Yeah.
Uhh. uhh.
Uh! Yeah. yeah.
Uhh.

Fuck em. yeah, uhh.
With my hands gripped. praise the Lord shit
Fuck her, never knew her
Screw her. (dump her body, dump her body) sewer
Our father. uh-huh. What you expected from his next of kin
I'm loco bro, but ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedroom, glocks in the kitchen
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shittin
Uhh, the lesson from the Smith and Wessun is depressin
Niggaz keep stressin, the same motherfuckin question
How many shots does it take, to make my heart stop
and my body start to shake, if I should die before I wake Chorus: Notorious B.I.G. (repeat 2X) With my hands gripped. praise the Lord shit
Our father. if I should die before I wake [Black Rob]
Fluck that
Snap a nigga shit, smash him with the fifth, watch his body lift
Shut his hottie's lips, bitch screamin, hit her body quick
Got me like the trifest not knowin how my life is
My life is, rap sheet long as the Turnpike
The sheistest, hey fella, who bidded with the lifers
Did it with the glocks, spit it witcha pops, you was in diapers
Loved me when you came to Rikers
Hated me all in the free cypher; mad you can't be like us
Some murderers who turn bikers -- see Biggie Smalls
recruited these snipers -- alumni do it just like us
Some pied pipers, squeezin life out y'all
It's all out war, be all wild as all outdoor
If a coward got beef, y'all be checkin his palm
Paralyzin my niggaz thorough kid, how bout yours?
Real quick to screw a nigga then, hop out four
Clean the wipers, hit the party up and, hop out yours
Bitch nigga. whoah. Chorus [Beanie Siegal]
Yo when you fuckin wit Mac, you fuckin wit the best
Still wall to wall with them dusty Tecs
Man you know how I handle my shit, S.K. can on my shit
Jump out of vans like Hannibal Smith
Man I spit a thousand rounds, your squad don't need it
Shredders in a riot pump leave you quadriplegic
When I squeeze don't breathe keep it lined and even
So when niggaz get hit, they be cryin screamin
Lyin bleedin -- from that iron steamin
And I ain't tryin to hear that bullshit, I ain't mean it
Niggaz start bitchin, when that pistol in they face
or I sick two puts to come and get you in your place
If I catch you in my shit, I'm wakin my bitch
Hear take this shit, crackin the brick, facin that shit
Takin two sniffs, grabbin my shit
Best believe if I get hit, y'all niggaz takin some shit
Picture niggaz takin my shit Chorus [Ice Cube]
Niggaz never thought they'd see Cube and Biggie
in the year 2000, all drunk and pissy
off whiskey, you can miss me, actin gay
He's the King of New York, I'm the King of L.A.
Doin it the O.G. way; it's sorta like
the Brooklyn Way, it's just the crook in me
So this is dedicated to the memory of
the Notorious One, the glorious one
And if you go for your gun, I got to go for mine
Cock my nine, and seperate yo' head from yo' spine
So, "Grab yo' dicks if you love hip-hop" and
fuck you niggaz that shot Big Pop'
The conspiracy, of this nation, for assassination
of the young black male in this black hell
And I can tell, no matter the weather
that you and Tupac got yo' shit together

1970 Somethin' nigga I don't sweat the date my moms was late,
So I had to plan my escape, out the skins,
In this world the fly girls, tangeray and hennesey,
Untill I call earl, 10 months in this gut, wut the fuck,
I wish moms would hurry up, so I can get buck wild,
Juvenile with the mics n shit, New York New York, ready for the likes of this,
Then came the worst date, May 21st 2: 19 was when my moma water burst,
No spouse in the house, so she rolled herself,
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help,
Umbilicle cords wrapped around my neck,
Im seein' my death, and I ain't even took my first step,
I made it out im bringin' mad joy,
The docter looked and said he's gonna be BAD BOY! (Faith Evans)
I remmember back in time, before all the homies died, before all the dollars and nines, i knew that i was
goin' somewhere, let me take you back in time, before i even got the rhyme, before i had nickels and
dimes, i knew that i was goin' somewhere, (The Game)
would pac be alive, if you let pac drive,
swear to god to reverse it I give my left eye,
with the right I visualized, the king of bed-stuy,
checkin his daughter tianna into junior high,
if I was in brooklyn, and B.I. was still alive, in 2006 it might sound like this,
N.Y. 7-1-8 2-1-2, with sues rendevouz,
its like moulin rouge,
high fashion, up town air force ones,
and vasquez, puerto ricans with fat asses
blaze dutch masters, we dump ashes, on models and S classes,
for you bastards, catch a cab to manhattan,
with that broadway actin', u hype that belly shit,
would you get you capped, and wrapped in plastic,
tell the captain, S Roge was happennin',
out here nor speak no evil, inside the magnum (Faith Evans)
I remmember back in time, before all the homies died, before all the dollars and nines, i knew that i was
goin' somewhere, let me take you back in time, (B.I.G.)
now i'm 13 smokin' blunts, makin' green,
on the drug scene, fuck the football team,
risk it, rupt ur spleens, by the age of 16,
hearin' the coach scream, make my lifetime dream,
i mean, i wanna blow up, stack my doe up,
so school i didn't show up, and fucked my flow up,
mom said that i should grow up, and check myself,
before i wreck myself, disrespect myself,
put the drugs on the shelf, naww! i couldn't see it,
Scarface king of New York, i wanna be it,
rap was secondary, money was neccessary,
untill i got encarcerated, kinda scary,
see 74' march 8, set me straight, not able to move behind a great steel gate,
time to contemplate, damn were did i fail,
all the money i stacked, was all the money for bail, (Faith Evans)
I remmember back in time, before all the homies died, before all the dollars and nines, i knew that i was
goin' somewhere, let me take you back in time, before i even got the rhyme, before i had nickels and
dimes, i knew that i was goin' somewhere, What about ten years from now?
Ten years from now, where do I want to be?
I wanna be just livin' man
Just living comfortably with my niggas man In a pool and shit, smoking plenty indo, you know I'm saying?
I got my wife, just lounging with my wife, you know I'm saying?
With my daughter, her daughter, you know just laid back
Just chillin', you know I'm saying? Living all my niggas is living where I think I'll be? Ten years
I don't think I will see it for real dogg for real man
That shit ain't, promised man
I don't think my luck is that good, I hope it is but if it ain't so be it, I'm ready You're dead wrong

We'll just talk about those I knows
The world is mine, can't you see

Ohh, yeah Now first come the cash, then come the ass
Then come big blunts with big chunks of hash
When I score with a whore she be game for sure
Pimp so hard, a nigga drag his mink on the floor Won't you admit it? I ain't gotta talk because I live it
Any chick fuckin' with me, believe me that's a privilege
I won't be satisfied, till all my niggaz get it
See you hit it then I hit it, we get it back to split it And Big be that nigga we be flyin' through your hood
And hood rats scopin' with they eyes on my goods
See we date 'em like we hate 'em, see 'em like we don't need 'em
Treat 'em like we meet 'em and never give up freedom And we only give our number to selected few
And it's best that you, never knew, what good head'll do
Turn a freak to a bisexual and if she's flexible
Fuck the nigga next to you The world is filled with pimps and hoes
We'll just talk about those I knows
(Make it hot)
The world is mine, can't you see
(Make it hot)

Had a few prostitutes and if you knew the truth
They're like pimps, you can't let 'em do it to you She ain't no sucker, I know that bitch man
She wanna be a pretty woman lovin' a rich man
Now here you come, drop top ridin'

Street life, pimp shit, make the hoe respect the game
You bought her diamonds and cars, trick that's a shame Say what you want, but I still figured
She left you 'cause you couldn't be, like them real niggaz
She was a hustler by nature and you was just faker
Than the average symps, found a badder pimp
Too Short Crazy ass man

And all that shit you bought that hoe man
After I heard about what the bitch did nigga, knew the hoe

(Make it hot)
Shit, you just a rest haven for hoes, man Just the first nigga that came along when the bitch got out the pen

Our cheddar stack it's just like a mountain
You heard about it cause she running her mouth She want's to ride, and she's trying to hide it
I'm cool as ever, she's too excited
Her man look like, he want to fight
But he ain't doing nothing, but running his mouth Fuck around and feel the fury of a high nigga
When I get busy throw your hands in the sky nigga
I got the illest of the ill mentality, niggas be grabbing me
Knowing that they'd rather be stabbing me
All up in my back trying to take my track
When I used to sell crack I ain't had problems like that
Street rules, watch your pockets and your jewels
A nigga front, throw the gat to the fool
Necks wanna move but's getting blasted
Streets to a flows from the ill ghetto bastard
As I release masterpieces like adhesive
Stuck to your ass, like tissue when your wiping fast
MC's have a hard time believing

When Jake come I'm leaving, the black man's motto
You got a better chance playing lotto
What you want nigga? Ah, Yo

Now watch me drip-drip-dri-di all over the street
The general consensus is you'll be the dominating fleet
Bitch raw, and let me continue to bring the heat
You know who been the kings of the block, the kings of the drops
The kings of the crap music and the kings of the cross
Niggas fire then drop shit like the purest of powder
That's why most of these niggas little song be sounding like ours
Couple years ago, niggas probably thought I was dieing

Trip skiing in the caribean, white sand discusing plans with my man,

Is there any money out ther for me
U just listen 2 this hustler's story Intro
~~~~~ No... fuck the bitches, fuck all the stank-ass hoes, all my
Niggas know... junior mafia click, gucci don, you know how we play.
Fuckin' skanless-ass bitches. you know how it go boots... i
Meet a bitch, fuck a bitch, next thing you know you fuckin'
The bitch. you just pass it around and shit, pass the shit like
A cold and shit. fuck'em. Verse 1
~~~~~~~ Now when I'm fuckin' those jen I'm invincible
Don't love no hoe, that's my priciple
'cause uh, bitches come [and uh] bitches go
That's why I get my nut and I be out the fuckin' door
[you know] they might be the one to set me up
Wanna get their little brother to wet me up
That's why I tote tecs and stuff to get'em off my case
Just in case the little fucker ends up misplaced
I don't give a bitch enough to catch the bus
And when I see the semen I'm leavin'
Bitches be schemin', I kid ya not
That's why I keep my windows locked and my glock cocked
One hoe said, big, why you so hard on us?
Why you swear all bitches are so scandalous?
Thug nigga 'til the end, tell a friend bitch
'cause when I like ya, then ya go and fuck my friend bitch
[and you know that ain't right] Chorus
~~~~~~ You know that ain't right With a friend of minex4 Verse 2
~~~~~~~ You see, I don't sweat these hoes
I keep'em in flavours like timbo's and jibbo's
Bitches just like to play the mary though
[yeah we know, drop the scenario]
It was me, dee, the mpv
The blunts and brew thang, knockin' some wu-tang
M-e-t-h-oh shit, look at them lips and them hips on that bitch
Dee hit the dip, so I can drop my mackadocious shit
Light the blunt clip, and recognize a pimp
Needless to speak, the gee's obsolete
Don't sleep! banged the skins in a week
On the creep up the avenue
I seen her on the block, who she rappin' to?
That's my nigga dee, damn he got gee
Now she fuckin' him and fuckin' me, see
You know that ain't right Repeat chorus Verse 3
~~~~~~~ Uh... now I play her far like a moon play a star
She still sweat me hard 'cause I'm a rap star
I be cruisin' up the block, I be passin' her
Pimpin' hard with the female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and dee blunted up, pissy, schemin' on a gang-bang
She should've used her intuition
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen
She's sayin' I dissed her 'cause I'm fuckin' her sister
A message to the fellas, that really gets'em pissed, uh
But she started that fuckin' family
She fucked my man dee, so why she mad at me?
Plus your sister look better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you
So break the fuck out like a rash
I'm glad I ain't spend no cash to hit your nasty ass Today's agenda, got the suitcase up in the Sentra
Go to room 112, tell 'em Blanco sent you
Feel the strangest, if no money exchanges
I got these kids in Ranges, to leave them niggas brainless All they tote is stainless, you just remain as
Calm as possible, make the deal go through
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make your killings clean, slugs up in between They eyes, like 'True Lies', kill 'em and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream
Or else, your life is on the shelf, we mean this Frank
Them cats we fuckin' wit put bombs in yo' moms gas tank Let's get this money baby, they shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies and burn 'em with dirty 380's
Then they come to kill our babies, that's all out
I got gats that blow the wall out, clear the mall out Fuck the fallout, word to Stretch I bet they pussy
The seven digits push me, fuckin' real, here's the deal
I got a hundred bricks, fourteen-five a piece
Enough to cop a six, buy the house on the beach Supply the peeps with Jeeps, brick apiece, capiche?
Everybody gettin' cream no one considered them leech
Think about it now, that's damn near one-point-five
I kill 'em all I'll be set for life, Frank pay attention These motherfuckers is henchmen, renegades
If you die they still get paid, extra probably
Fuck a robbery, I'm the boss, promise you won't rob 'em, I promise
But of course you know I had my fingers crossed Niggas bleed just like us
Picture me bein' scared of a nigga
That breathe the same air as me
Niggas bleed just like us
Picture me bein' shook we can both pull burners
Make the motherfuckin' beef cook Niggas bleed just like us
Picture a nigga hidin', my life in that man hands
While he just decidin'
Niggas bleed just like us
I'd rather go toe to toe with all of y'all
Runnin' ain't in my protocol Since it's on, I call my nigga Arizona Ron
From Tuscon, pushed the black Yukon
Usually had the slow grooves on, mostly rock the Isley
Stupid as a young 'un, chose not the moves wisely Sharper with game, him and his crooks, called The Juxs
Heard it was sweet, 'bout three-fifty a piece
Ron bought a truck, two bricks laid in the cut
His peeps got bucked, got locked the fuck up That's when Ron vanished, came back, speakin' Spanish
Lavish habits, two rings, twenty carats
Here's a criminal, nigga made America's Most
Killed his baby, mother, brother, slit his throat The nigga got bagged with the toast
Weeded, took it to trial, beat it
Now he feel he undefeated, he mean it
Nothing to lose, tattooed around his gun wounds Everything to gain, embedded in his brain
And me I feel the same for this money and diamonds
Specially if my daughter cryin', I ain't lyin'
Y'all know the science Niggas bleed just like us
Picture me bein' scared of a nigga
That breathe the same air as me
Niggas bleed just like us
Picture me bein' shook we can both pull burners
Make the motherfuckin' beef cook Niggas bleed just like us
Picture a nigga hidin' my life in that man hands
While he just decidin'
Niggas bleed just like us
I'd rather go toe to toe with all of y'all
Runnin' ain't in my protocol We agreed to go on shootin' is silly
Because niggas could be hidin' in showers with Mac-Milli's
So I freaked 'em, the telly manager was Puerto Rican
Gloria, from Astoria, I went to war with her Peeps in ninety-one, stole a gun from my workers
And they took drugs, they tried to jerk us
We blazed they place, long story, Glo' sent my face
Got shook, thought a nigga was comin' for the safe Now she breakin', shut up, 112, what's shakin'?
A Jamaican, some bitches I swear, they look gay
In a black Range Rover, been outside all day
If it's trouble let me know, I'll be on my way Please, I got kids to feed, I done seen you make niggas bleed
Nightmare, this bitch don't need it
Ron, get the gasoline, this spot, we 'bout to blow this
Get the cash before the cops and Range Rover cats notice Room 112, right by the staircase, perfect place
When they evacuate, they meet they fate
Ron pass the gasoline, the nigga passed me kerosene
Fuck it, it's flammable, my hunger is unexplainable Strike the match, just what I expected
The dread kid ejected in seconds
And here come two, opposite sexes, one black, one Malaysian
We in the hallway waitin' patient As soon as she hit the door we start blastin'
I saw her brains hit the floor, Ron laughin', I swear to God
I hit Maxi Priest at least twelve times in the chest
Spit around, shot the chink in the breast She cryin', head shots put her to rest
Pop open the briefcases, nothin but Franklin faces
The spot's hot, sprinklers, alarm systems
That's when other guests start to slip in It's time for us to get to dippin'
I know them niggas in the Range is on they way up
Flippin', pistol grippin', I load the clip in
The hallway, got real loud and crowded They walked right past us, I don't know how they allowed it
The funny thing about it, through all the excitement
They Range got towed, they double parked by a hydrant
Stupid motherfuckers Yo let, let, let me ask you a question yo
Yo would you kill for me?
(Girl)
Hmmm... yeah
(Puff Daddy)
What took you so long to answer motherf*cker?
(Girl)
I don't know
(Puff Daddy)
The f*ck wrong with you b*tch? One: Notorious B.I.G. When I met you I admit my first thoughts was to trick
You look so good huh, I suck on your daddy's d*ck (yeah)
I never felt that way in my life
It didn't take long before I made you my wife (uh, yeah)
Got no rings and sh*t, just my main squeeze
Come into the crib, even had a set a keys
During the days you helped me bag up my nickels
In the process, I admit, I tricked a little (yeah)
But you was my b*tch, the one who'd never snitch (uhh)
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy f*ckin rich
And I admit, when the time is right, the wine is right
I treat you right, you talk slick, I beat you right Notorious B.I.G. Just me and my b*tch (variations repeat to next verse) (Girl)
But you know you love that a$$, don't you?
(Puff Daddy)
Yeah, no question
(Girl)
No question
(Puff Daddy)
Yo, let me ask you another question
(Girl)
What?
(Puff Daddy)
You ever f*ck around on me?
(Girl)
Why would I do that?
(Puff Daddy)
Yo don't lie to me motherf*cker Two: Notorious B.I.G. Moonlight strolls with the hoes, oh no, that's not my steelo
I wanna b*tch that like to play celo, and craps
Packin gats, in a Coach bag steamin dime bags
A real b*tch is all I want, all I ever had (yeah, c'mon)
With a glock just as strong as me
Totin guns just as long as me, the b*tch belongs with me
Any plans with another b*tch, my b*tch'll spoil it
One day, she used my toothbrush to clean the toilet (that's nasty)
Throwin my clothes out the windows, so when the wind blows
I see my Polos and Timbos
Hide my car keys so I can't leave
A real slick b*tch, keep a trick up her sleeve
And if I deceive, she won't take it lightly
She'll invite me, politely, to fight G
And then we lie together, cry together
I swear to God I hope we f*ckin die together (Girl)
Let me tell you nigga, if I ever, ever catch your a$$ f*ckin around
I'ma cut your mother-f*ckin d*ck off
(Puff Daddy)
Hah, heheh stop playin, hah
(Girl)
I ain't playin, ain't no jokes, ain't no jokes
Ain't no jokes
(Puff Daddy)
Yo, don't don't play with my d*ck Three: Notorious B.I.G. She helped me plan out my robberies on my enemies
Didn't hesitate to squeeze, to get my life out of danger (yeah)
One day, she put nine one one on the page
Had to call back, whether it's minor or major (yeah)
No response, the phone just rung
Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem
When I pulled up, police was on the scene
Had to make the U-turn, make sure my sh*t was clean
Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes
Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
It didn't take long before the tears start
I saw my b*tch dead with the gunshot to the heart
And I know it was meant for me
I guess the niggaz felt they had to kill the closest one to me (uh, yeah)
And when I find em your life is to and end
They killed my best friend... me and my b*tch Uh, yeah, yeah
Uh...
Uh, motherf*cker yeah Previously, on Ready to Die
... me and her sister had somethin goin on
(Ayo, would you listen to me motherfucker?)
I reach my peak, I can't speak
Call my nigga Cheek, tell him that my will is weak
(Ayo c'mon nigga, cut that)
I'm sick of niggas lyin,
I'm sick of bitches hawkin
(Ayo, yoyo Big, ayo chill)
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin *gunshot*

But I still can't let you pass me Yo what's beef to you, three niggaz with hoodies and bats
That ain't shit compared to one small cat with gats
When we came here we cut off all kind circulation
Breathin, eatin, the whole situation
When we do our shit we do our shit for real
While you take your money for your deal and make your own beats
Compose your own sheets, that's aight but chill
I'ma spend that mil and cop only hot shit
Rock top shit you know how The Lox get
Then you can see me flyin in the Bentley cockpit
Lox and B-I, hold our grica down for years
Gang not, but we been had our black tears
Niggaz under the stairs only understand what we got
Underground, all above must get shot
You couldn't book me Dano, see Luciano put the burners
to all y'all, what nigga bring it I'm callin y'all You already know what it's about when I run up in your house
Put the gun up in your mouth and get the money out the couch
Hearin you out is senseless, perhaps for instance
I give this faggot a french kiss
Black gloves, no prints, dark tints
Word on the street they ain't heard from him since
You know about life after kicked the kid in
Since me and my mi-dan can flip seven gri-dams
Scri-dam the flow is forbidd-en
Either you ridin or you dyin cause we swingin iron
Lox and Poppa, turning niggaz into Jim Hoffa
Who gon stop us, it's your last joint double copper
You gettin money or your runnin from the Feds
Ain't nothin over here but sixteen and one in the head
And I solemnly swear
That all y'all niggaz out there got a problem this year Before you think of keepin me down, heatin me down
The flow like water get deepe and you drown
with no soul, many niggaz roll with no dough
Even the small Dunn got a little black hole
Your destiny is somethin you can never figure out
Niggaz is never happy til there's blood up in your mouth
There's a lot of killers, but who the hell are you to play in this?
A lot are dead, how the hell you take the pain?
Live with it got money you better get with it
My man had the thug in him did his bid with it
Get married to the game but never have a kid with it
Advice from the wise, slice the pies
Too many schemes divides, when dreams collide
Teams provide, war for the street to absorb
Stashed in the ceiling and you slept on the floor
Only a blind dove'll fall in love with a whore Uhh, uhh, uhh
Who the fuck wanna squeeze?
My Desert Ease make MC's freeze
You wakin up in cold sweats, they just dreams
You still apoligizin, analyzin, my size and your size and
realizin, a fist fight would be asinine
You just pop wines I must pop nines
Genuine steel piece, nozzle in your grill piece
You're sup, two bricks, every cook up
We can up, all I see is the future
Disrespect, I shoot ya
By the way, them bricks, get flipped weekly
Sold by soldiers that mix weed with the leak leak
Die for a dollar nigga, life ain't sweet
Play for keeps wet shirts with experts on the creep
I be the mob fiance, about to marry it
Illegal transactions in Farragut with Arabics
Why not, they fit twelve up in the bedroom
Imagine what they stash is like, make you a classic like
my first LP, beef with me is unhealthy
Fuck around and get an ul-cer, loose your pulse or
collapsed lung, look how many gats I brung
For them homos, still doin promos
Break both your legs you're movin slow-mo, got shined to glow mo'
Nine hundred and ninety six grams, you need for mo' I'm sittin in the crib dreamin about leer jets and coupes
The way salt shoops and how they sell records like snoop
Oops!
I'm interrupted by a doorbell
3: 52, who the hell is this?
I gets up quick
Cocks my shit
Stop the dogs from barkin
Then proceed to walkin
Its a face that I seen before
My nigga sing, we used to sling on the 16th floor
Check it
I look deeper
I see blood up on his sneakers
And his fist gripped a chrome four-fifth
So I dip
Nigga, is you creepin or speakin?
He tells me c-rock just got hit up at the beacon
I opens up the door, pitiful
Is he in critical?
Retaliation for this one won't be minimal
Cuz I'm a criminal
Way before the rap shit
Bust the gat shit
Puff won't even know what happened,
If it's done smoothly
Silencers on the uzi
Stash in the hooptie
My alibi, any cutie
With a booty that done fuck the pop
Head spinnin, reminiscin bout my man c-rock Somebody's got ta die
If I got, you got ta go
Somebody's got to die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody's got to die
Nobody got ta know
That I killed yo ass in the mist, kid Somebody's got ta die
If I got, you got ta go
Somebody's got to die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody's got to die
Nobody got ta know
That I killed yo ass in the mist, kid Fillin clips he explained our situation
Precisely, so we know exactly what we facin
Some kid named jason
In a honda station wagon
Was braggin
About how much loot and crack he stackin
Rock had a grip so they formed up a clique
Small crew
'round the time I was locked up with you
True indeed
But yo nigga let me proceed
Don't fill them clips too high
Give them bullets room to breathe
Damn where was i?
Yeah
One night in town
Blew the fuck up
D-rock went home
And jay got stuck the fuck up
Hit 'em twice
Got 'em right for the virgin white
Pistol whipped his kids
And taped up his wife
He said yo rock, set em up, no question
Wet em up no less
Than 50 shots in his direction
How many shots?
Man nigga, I seen mad holes
What kinda gats?
Hitch links, cocks, and calicoles
But fuck that
I know where all them niggas rest at
In the buildin hustlin
And they don't be strapped
Supreme in black
Is downstairs, the engine runnin
Find a bag to put the guns in
And c'mon if yo comin Somebody's got ta die
If I got, you got ta go
Somebody's got to die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody's got to die
Nobody got ta know
That I killed yo ass in the mist, kid Somebody's got ta die
If I got, you got ta go
Somebody's got to die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody's got to die
Nobody got ta know
That I killed yo ass in the mist, kid Exchanged hugs and pounds before the throw down
How it's gonna go down
Lay these niggas low-down
Slow down
Fuck all that plannin shit
Run up in they cribs
And make em catch the man n shit
See niggas like you do ten year bids
Miss the niggas they want
And murder innocent kids
Not i
One niggas in my eye
That's jason
Ain't no slugs gonna be wasted
Revenge I'm tastin at the tip of my lips
I can't wait to feel my clip in his hips
Pass the chocolate
Thai
Sing ain't lie
There's jason with his back to me
Talkin to his faculty
I start to get a funny feelins
Put the mask on in case his niggas start squealin
Scream his name out
Squeeze six knuckles shorter
Nigga turned around holdin his daughter 
 Notorious B.I.G. F/ R. Kelly

And all that sweet winin and dinin
Well I'm fuckin you tonight [Big] Here's another one
And another one
Uhh, uhh, what? Verse One: Notorious B.I.G. Some say the x, make the sex
Spec-tacular, make me lick you from yo neck
To yo back, then ya, shiverin, tongue deliverin
Chills up that spine, that ass is mine
Skip the wine and the candlelight, no Cristal tonight
If its alright with you, we fuckin (that's alright)
Deja vu, the blunts sparked, finger fuckin in the park
Pissy off Bacardi Dark
Remember when I used to play between yo legs
You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head
Straight to yo mother's bed
At the Mariott, we be lucky if we find a spot
Next to yo sister, damn I really missed the
way she used to rub my back, when I hit that
Way she used to giggle when yo ass would wiggle
Now I know you used to sweets at the Parker Meridian
Trips to the Carribean, but tonight, no ends Chorus 2X Verse Two: Notorious B.I.G. Girl you look fine, like a windface Rolex, you just shine
I like that waistline
Let me hit that from behind, which wall you wanna climb
My styles genuine, girl I love you long time
I got you pinned up, with yo fuckin limbs up
All because you like the way my Benz was rimmed up
Bitch keep yo shin up, please watch me do thee
Nasty, like it when you make it move fast mommy
I like it when you tro' it pon me
No love makin, strictly back breakin
Ceas' know, all his hoes, go to my door
Then they go to his flo', to fuck some more
So no, caviar, sharp bar, uh uh
Strictly sex that's pretty and left over spaghetti
I know you used to slow CD's and Don P's
But tonight its eight tracks and six-packs while I hit that Chorus 2X Verse Three: R. Kelly Lets stop the bullshit baby
Let me take you to the stop, get you hot
So you wanna be with me, Puff Daddy
B.I.G., bring that ass to me Chorus: repeat to fade with variations

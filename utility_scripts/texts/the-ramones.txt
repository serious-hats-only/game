Navy blue book bag on my back Couple miles 'til I'm at the grey hound station
Hope they let me ride away with them Got pretty mad at my father today
But I'm still thinkin bout what my mother would say As I'm singin an old song she used to sing
When things weren't going the way she wanted them to I wanna run away
I do
I wanna run away
I do
I wanna run away
I do
I wanna run away from you
I wanna leave this school
I do
I wanna leave this town
I do
But she'll be worried sick if
I do (if I do) Can't run away and leave my mama alone
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home
Cause I'm her boy mama's boys
Just don't run away, run away
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy
Just don't So I turn around and headed to the old run down building
Bells gonna ring before I make it back I watch the upper class men drive right past me
Wish they'd let me ride away with them
Still haven't got over it yet
It's been playin in my ears all mornin I swear My iPods the same tune my mother would sing
When things weren't goin the way she wanted them to I wanna run away
I do
I wanna run away
I do
I wanna run away
I do
I wanna run away from you
I wanna leave this school
I do
I wanna leave this town
I do
But she'll be worried sick if
I do (if I do) Can't run away and leave my mama alone
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home
Cause I'm her boy mama's boys
Just don't run away, run away
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy
Just don't Never get mad enough to walk out
If I do then I won't be gone for long Never fed up enough to leave her
No matter what I'll love her just the same That's my mama
Yeah
So no matter what I leave unless he's coming soon Can't run away and leave my mama alone
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home
Cause I'm her boy mama's boys
Just don't run away
Run away, yeah
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy
Just don't If you think you can, well, come on man
I was a Green Beret in Vietnam
I said, no more of your fairy stories
'Cause I got my other worries 53rd and 3rd, standin' on the street
53rd and 3rd, I'm tryin' to turn a trick
53rd and 3rd, you're the one they never pick
53rd and 3rd, don't it make you feel sick? If you think you can, well, come on man
I was a Green Beret in Vietnam
I said, no more of your fairy stories
'Cause I got my other worries 53rd and 3rd, standin' on the street
53rd and 3rd, I'm tryin' to turn a trick
53rd and 3rd, you're the one they never pick
53rd and 3rd, don't it make you feel sick? Then I took out my razor blade
Then I did what God forbade
Now the cops are after me
But I proved that I'm no sissy 53rd and 3rd, standin' on the street
53rd and 3rd, I'm tryin' to turn a trick
53rd and 3rd, you're the one they never pick
53rd and 3rd, don't it make you feel sick? 53rd and 3rd, 53rd and 3rd

And I know just what to do
I've been thinking it over
And I know I just can't trust myself
I'm a Gypsy prince
Covered with diamonds and jewels
But then my lover exposes me
I know I'm just a damn fool CHORUS:
I give what I've got to give,
I give what I need to live
I give what I've got to give, it's important if I want to live
I wanna live
I want to live my life
I wanna live
I want to live my life As I load my pistol
Of fine German steel
I never thought I'd be so down and out
Having my last meal
But I know I can do it
It just took a few years
As I execute my killers
The morning is near CHORUS I wanna live
I want to live my life
I wanna live
I wanna live my life
I wanna live
I want to live my life
I wanna live
I wanna live my life Sid was a punk rock king Nancy was a broken queen
Their lives were so glamorous Sid and Nancy were a mess When you're hooked on heroin Don't you know you'll never win
Drugs don't ever pay You really did it your way Love kills Love kills Love kills We still believe in anarchy It makes me so damn angry
Sid and Nancy meant a lot to me You may be dead but your souls are free
Like Romeo and Juliet You two made a pact of death
Like the needle that ya used Sid and Nancy were born to lose
Love kills Love kills Love kills Sid never meant any harm He shot some dope into his arm
All he wanted was some fun Now she's lying in a pool of blood
Always loaded, always high Why did you have to die?
I'll say one thing is It leaves me with a bitter taste Love kills Love kills Love kills Love kills Love kills Love kills Love kills Love kills Love kills Somebody
Somebody Put Something In My Drink
Somebody Another night out on the street
Stopping for my usual seat
Oh, bartender, please Tanqueray and tonic's my favorite drink
I don't like anything colored pink
That just stinks... it's not for me It feels like somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something
Somebody put something Blurred vision and dirty thoughts
Feel (out of place), very distraught
Feel something coming on Kick the jukebox, slam the floor
Drink, drink, drink, drink some more
I can't think
Hey! What's in this drink? It feels like somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something... in my drink... in my drink... in my drink... in my drink So you think it's funny
A college prank
Goin' insane for something to drink
Feel a little dry Oh, I couldn't care what you think of me
Cause somebody put something in my drink
I can't think
Hey! Give me a drink It feels like somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink Somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink Rock N'

Can't put it off another day
I don't care what others say
They say we don't listen anyway
Time has come today, hey The room has changed today
I have no place to stay
I'm thinking about the subway
My love has blown away
My tears have come and gone
Oh, Lord I got to run
I got no home
No, I have no home Now the time has come
Nowhere to run
Might get burned up by the sun
But I'll have my fun
I've been loved, pushed aside
I've been crushed by tumbling tide
And my soul has been psychedelicized Now the time has come
There are things to realize
Time has come today
Time has come today Time

No place to run
Might get burned up by the sun
But I'll have my fun

And inside my heart I feel I'm dyin'
Wise guys never compromise
Then they loose their rights and they act surprised
Jail really cuts ya down to size Let the punishment fit the crime
The footprints on the sand of time
The philosophy of the poet's rhyme
Makes a man humble in his prime You can go up, down, or sideways
Be on death row, counting the days
They say the answers are blowin' in the wind
And to take yourself out would really be a sin
You just have to cope and start over again Let the punishment fit the crime
The footprints on the sand of time
The philosophy of the poet's rhyme
Makes a man humble in his prime Little child cries in his sleep
And life makes promises it can't keep
And then feel you had, had enough.
You realize somehow, someway
Your destiny was planned from the very first day Let the punishment fit the crime
The footprints on the sand of time
The philosophy of the poet's rhyme
Makes a man humble in his prime Let the punishment fit the crime
The footprints on the sand of time
The philosophy of the poet's rhyme
Makes a man humble in his prime Let the punishment fit the crime
Let the punishment fit the crime
Let the punishment fit the crime
Let the punishment fit the crime

I need something to slow me down
My brain is hanging upside down
Well, I need something to slow me down Shouldn't wish you happiness
Wish her the very best
Fifty thousand dollar dress
Shaking hands with your highness See through you like cellophane
You watch the world complain
But you do it anyway
Who am I, am I to say? Bonzo goes to bit burg
Then goes out for a cup of tea
As I watched it on TV
Somehow it really bothered me
Drank in all the bars in town
For an extended foreign policy Pick up the pieces My brain is hanging upside down
And I need something to slow me down
Ooh yeah, my brain is hanging upside down
And I need something to slow me down There's one thing that makes me sick
It's when someone tries to hide behind politics
I wish that time could go by fast
Somehow they manage to make it last My brain is hanging upside down
I need something to slow me down
Ooh yeah, my brain is hanging upside down
And I need something to slow me down Ooh yeah, my brain is hanging upside down
And I need something to slow me down
My brain is hanging upside down You know it's generally known you got everything at home
Kisses out of desperation bring you more aggravation
And you don't come close, you don't come close, you don't come close
You bring out your souvenirs soak them wet with your tears
You lose your imagination out of more aggravation
And you don't come close, you don't come close, you don't come close
You turn red with rage but act your age
Only thing that your regret you need more time to forget
And you don't come close, you don't come close, you don't come close
You know it's generally known you got everything at home
Kisses out of desperation bring you more aggravation
And you don't come close, you don't come close, you don't come close
You turn red with rage but act your age
Only thing that your regret you need more time to forget
You don't come close, you don't come close, you don't come close
And you don't come close, you don't come close, you don't come close
You don't come close, you don't come close, you don't come close

All I want to do is forget about my past
And smoke a little weed, really nothing too drastic
Any time you see me in a picture and I'm smiling
Probably 'cause I'm faded, or I'm chilling with the fans
Not really the type to let a nigga talk back
But I'mma let it slide 'cause my niggas too violent
Shout out to the ones who spend money like a habit
Even if they had a million dollars, they'd be trappin'
Got a couple girls shooting movies on the mattress
Then I hit the booth, make the motherfucking soundtrack
Then I play it back on the eighty-inch plasma
Then I get 'em faded off that super-fantastic
Roll that grandmaster, smell it through the plastic
Nobody can handle me, I'm gone when the shit's too strong The night's too long
I took too much and I've gone too far
And I might not make it

I might not make it
I might not make it
I might not make it this time
I might not make it

Took my niggas from the four-one to Pacifico
We no longer put no fish scale on the fishing boat
Listen, hoe, I know all you bitches want is liquor, smoke (Liquor, smoke)
I know all you bitches want is dick and dough (Dick and dough)
Told her you don't gotta make it difficult
Baby, sit calm, we don't need another episode
Hippie bitches sending me titty pictures
She told me no religion was the new religion
She said she don't believe in God, but her shoe's Christian
I heard she serving everybody like the soup kitchen
Getting hoes higher, getting hoes higher
She got work in the morning, I'm getting hoes fired
Why the fuck you call it purple when you mix it pink
You know I fucking mix the drinks when the shit's too strong The night's too long

I'm hella posted in the trunk now
I think I finally fell in love now
Her name is Tammy she got hella bitches
She let me fuck 'em while my niggas filming
My place so empty need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table , come from ebony
She cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her faces when I love my baby
Man, I love my baby
Man, I love my baby
Trust me, trust me, I love my baby
Man, I love my baby
Man, I love my baby
Trust me, trust me
Oh yeah

Oh-oh-oh-oh oh yeah Baby, you are so strong
Baby, you are calm, you are so calm, yeah
Tell me where it went wrong
Tell me how to love, it's been so long
When a call's not enough, and you just need to touch
Thinking twice on my one
But you just need to trust You're only looking for attention
You only notice it 'cause I'm never around
You're only looking for attention, oh, oh
You're only looking for attention
The only problem is you'll never get enough
You're only looking for attention, oh, oh What do you expect now?
Only thing left is the sex now
'Cause baby, too vexed now
Only see me on the TV or the bed now
When a touch not enough
You were more than a fuck
Thinking twice on a one
But you just need to trust You're only looking for attention
You only notice it cause I'm never around
You're only looking for attention, oh, oh
You're only looking for attention
The only problem is you'll never get enough
You're only looking for attention, oh, oh Attention

You only notice it 'cause I'm never around
You're only looking for attention, oh, oh
You're only looking for attention
The only problem is you'll never get enough
You're only looking for attention, oh, oh I ran out of tears when I was 18
So nobody made me but the main streets
'Cause too many people think they made me
Well if they really made me then replace me
Homeless to forbes list, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever "son" me
My flow too sick, kevin costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never making money
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a queen street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pulling up in aventadors
Just know we been grinding on them sidewalks Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They showed me all the signs They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on Say, say say
I come from myrtle, one brung late night melee
Say, say, say
We hung all summer, sprung mattress with bae bae
Say, say, say
Trippin' off dyke, and my name strike with pay day
Say, say, say
Flippin' blue lighting, tightening, strapped with ak
Say, say, say
Og one, told me one, show me one, eight ways
How to segue
Pussy, power, profit in headache
I reminisce my life innocence
Or life innocent
Or life intimate, with fame
Like number ten
With like women up women art with women up
Gon' get it, good game
She wanna hang with a starboy
The sun and the moon and star, boy
Astronomer, anonymous
I line 'em up, grind 'em up, these nine of us
And 5 of us have probably fucked
She mollied up, I tallied up all the parts boy
Twenty legs, arms, head (head)
Head, head, more head (head)
Oh god bless the dead (yeah)
I'm livin' life high off life
I wear my chokes off to bed
I'm the greatest nigga, why you so scared to say it?
I wanna rock, I wanna rock, I wanna cop more land
I never stop
I wanna quick advance on a bill if it ain't one
Break everything, I'm a hustler, came from Sidewalks saved my life
Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie

They showed me all the signs They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on I'm addied up, added up
I just ate a plate for breakfast
Put it in a cup, then I mix it up with Texas
Chest feeling heavy like a midget on my necklace
Bitches that we came with got all of your bitches jealous
'Bout to leave the crib with a couple of my pirates
Driving by the streets we used to walk through like a triumph
Mix it in a potion like a science
That liquid G diet got a nigga so quiet
'Cause the shit so strong, got me feeling like I'm dying
The shit so raw, nothing else can get me higher
Only time you see me's when I'm balling with my niggas
'Cause my life too private, my ride too private
My flight too private, my show's so riot
My jaw so tired, I go all night in my city to the fall
Then it's time for me to fly her
I got a girl at home even though she ain't flying And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
Baby girl, you know what I like, baby, you know just what I like
Baby, you know what I like (like like like like like) Don't be mad, let her get hers
Don't be mad, let her get hers
She make her own luck
She don't give a fuck
She trying to have fun
Take a break from the love
Man, your girl so bad, let me get her
Your girl so bad, let me get her
I make my own luck, I make that pussy talk
On call to the fall, you can like it or not
Nigga, back the fuck up
If you ain't with me, motherfucker, you against me
If you ain't complimenting, nigga, you offending
I been out here last year wasting hella time
XO is the only time investment
Them fall shows every year like a birthday
And I'mma do it every year in my birthplace
And I ain't been this gone since Thursday
I never said that I'd be sober in the first place And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it

I just passed that liquor, fell off stage
I just sold out the 02 at my own pace
I can say that I'm attached to nobody
I been getting paper while these niggas tryin' a stop me
Shout my nigga Doc, that's a mentor
Had some bad business, nothing personal
But now the word out that we back on
Some young Quincy Jones, dark skin Michael Jackson
And these the motherfuckers that they packaged
Their new shit all be sounding like my past shit
Bring your girl to my show, give her floor seats
Then she go downtown like she owe me
XO, XO, XO, mix it up, pour it up, take it down slow
This is my sound, nigga, fuck your sound
Did it from the ground, ask around, bitch
When I touch down, I'mma shake shit up
Fuck your new man, I'mma break it up
He can come back when I go on the road
But that pussy mine for the next three months
'Cause the kid back, kid back, kid back
Cop ten whips for my niggas when we land
Queen Street, nigga, making money overseas
Had a few more debts, I'mma pay it all in cash
Shout out XO, shout out to "The Boy" broke bread on tour
Man, it's all love now
Shout out my nigga Stix, doing good in these streets
Man he popping more bottles then us right now
Reason why they stressing, city never sunny
When the kid come through with more niggas than Apollo
But ain't shit funny, can't nobody stop me
All my hoes are trained, I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
I make all of them swallow

I make all of them swallow
All of, all of
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
I make all of them swallow All alone she was living
In a world without an end or beginning
Baby girl was living life for the feeling
But I don't mind, I don't mind
And all the wrongs she committed
She was numb and she was so co-dependent
She was young and all she had was the city
But I don't mind, I don't mind And I know that she's capable of anything, it's riveting
But when you wake up she's always gone, gone, gone In the night she hears him calling
In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)
In the night when she comes crawling
Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand) He sang a song when he did it
He was cold and he was so unforgiving
Now she dances to the song on the minute
Yeah, all the time, all the time
It make her weak when she hear it
And it got her on her knees like religion
She was young and she was forced to be a woman
Yeah, all the time, all the time And I know that she's capable of anything, it's riveting
But when you wake up she's always gone, gone, gone In the night she hears him calling
In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)
In the night when she comes crawling
Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand) I don't think you understand In the night she hears him calling
In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)
In the night when she comes crawling
Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand) From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alize with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Sky's getting cold, we flying from the north
Rocking with our city like a sold out show
House full of hoes that specialize into hoe-in
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets, Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen if our haters caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen, fast life gripping
Yeah we still tipping
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Face try to mimic, get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl girl put in work
Girl put in work Push it to the limit, push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money, a virgin to the fame
So this my only chance so when I'm over only pray
That I flow from the bottom, closer to the top
The higher that I climb, the harder I'ma drop
These pussy ass niggas trying to hold on to their credits
So I tell em use a debit watch they image start to lessen
I wanna 'em like discretion, why these niggas testing
Always fucking testing, why these niggas testing
Shit that I got 'em on, straight bar hopping to the music of the ambiance
Get shit poppin', zombies of the night
Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew, get it in like pockets
Downtown loving, when the moon coming
Only place to find base heads and high women All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl girl put in work
Girl put in work Better slow down, she'll feel it in the morning
Ain't the kind of girl you'll be seeing in the morning
Too damn raw ain't no nigga worth her holding
Ain't no nigga that she holding man her love is too damn foreign
Look at all that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl girl put in work All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl girl put in work
Girl put in work [Verse 1]
Telling me I'm the only one that you'll love, boo
Baby, it's okay
If you let me stay
I won't love any other girl the way I love you
Baby girl just stay

Never thought I'd be the one you'd want to
Give away your heart
Gotta do my part now [Bridge] [Hook] [Break] Break it baby, break it baby, it it it it down
Break it baby, break it baby, it it it it down (It down)
Break it down, break it down, break it down [Hook x3] Heaven in her mouth, got a hell of a tongue
I can feel her teeth when I drive on a bump
Fingers letting go of the wheel when I cum
Whe-wheel when I cum, whe-wheel when I cum
David Carradine, I'ma die when I cum
She just givin' head, she don't know what I've done
Like I'm James Dean, I'ma die when I'm young
Die when I'm young, die when I'm young Heaven knows that I've been told
Paid for the life that I chose
If I could, I'd trade it all
Trade it for a halo
And she said that she'll pray for me
I said, "It's too late for me
'Cause I think it's safe to say" This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
No ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life Valhalla is where all the righteous are led
Moorhall is where all the damned will be kept
Devil on my lap and a cross on my neck
Cross on my neck, cross on my neck
Over 45, I'ma drift on a bend
Do a buck 20, I'ma fly off the edge
Everybody said it would hurt in the end
Hurt in the end, but I feel nothin' She said that she'll pray for me
I said, "It's too late for me
'Cause I think it's safe to say" This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
No ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life Angels all singin' in monasteries, yeah
My soul is burning in LaFerraris
Father, sorry, father, sorry
Halos are given to ordinary lives
No, but this ain't ordinary life This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
No ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
No ordinary life
Woah You bring good to my lonely life, honestly
It's hard for me to look into your eyes
When, I say that I would be nothing without your love
I feel the rush and it's amazing Maybe I've been always destined to end up in this place, yeah
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all
Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way
Cause I know, all I know, all I know I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
Woooo, woooo, woooo I think I've been in Hollywood for too long
Cause I can feel my soul burning, feel it burning slow
But I would be nothing without the touch
I feel the rush and it's amazing Maybe I've been always destined to end up in this place
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all
Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way
Cause I know, all I know, all I know I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
Woooo, woooo, woooo
I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
Woooo, woooo, woooo I don't know
I get so wrapped up in a world where nothing's as it seems
And real life is stranger than my dreams Ask around about her
She don't get emotional
Kill off all her feelings
That's why she ain't approachable
She know her pussy got a fan base
A couple niggas with a suitcase
Suit and tie niggas who play roleplay
When it comes to money she play no games She lick it up just like a candy
She wanna make 'em leave their family
She trying to live a life so fancy
She wanna pull up in a Bentley
She ain't got time for lovin'
Louis Vuitton her husband
She rather die in lusting
She rather die in the club, 'till she Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper

Not the type to fuck around, go and turn that ass around She don't depend on anybody
Know just what to do with her own body
Counting all that money like a hobby
She don't give a fuck about nobody
And she got her whole crew poppin'
And she bend it over like she got no back bone
Got a couple niggas blinging up a trap phone
She don't need nobody waiting back home, she got it She lick it up just like a candy
She wanna make them leave their family
She trying to live a life so fancy
She wanna pull up in a Bentley
She ain't got time for lovin'
Louis Vuitton her husband

I feel the darkness, went away from you Hey, don't stop your lovin', walk out on me
Don't stop for nothin', you're what I bleed
I learned to love you, the way you need
'Cause I know what's pain, this is not the same I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
(Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)
I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
(Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing) I was too busy tryna find you with someone else
The one I couldn't stand, to be with was myself
'Cause I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
(Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing) Pick up your phone, I got a question, oh
If I die tonight, would you regret it? Don't stop your lovin', it's all I have
'Cause I can't function, no I won't last
I swear I'll love you just like the past
'Cause I know what's pain, this is not the same I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
(Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)
Oh, I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
(Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing) I was too busy tryna find you with someone else
The one I couldn't stand, to be with was myself
'Cause I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
(Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing) When I feel the love, girl I hesitate
It's what I'm guilty of, oh yeah (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
I can't get enough, I'm insane
Without your touch
Touch, touch
(I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)
(Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)
(Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you) When the sun goes up, you're﻿ searching for a love
So your heart won't lead you to anyone
When the sun goes down, I know what you become
You become awake, unlike the rest of us I lay my head on a thousand beds
It's been a test to see how far a man, can go without himself
I think I lost the only piece that held it all in place
Now my madness is the only love I let myself embrace
I could've stayed But I chose the lie
I chose the life
Then I realized
She might have been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now I'll never see your face
But it's okay I adapted anyway Uh Adapted to these models
Whose adapted to the bottle
They take it down like water
Just to burn away their sorrows
I'll stay up till tomorrow
Just to tear down all their morals
And all is fair in love and war, she's pure So pure,
Like the love that's so uncut and raw and clean
So clean,
As opposed to what I offered because I chose a lie
I chose the lie
Then I realized
She might have been the one
I've let it go
For a little fun
Oh I've made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now I'll never see your face
But it's okay I adapted anyway She might just be the one
She might just be the one
She might just be the one (might just be the one)
Might just be the one
She might just be the one I know what you did
I know
So I'ma let you taste her
I ain't washing my sins
I ain't washing my sins Now we're lying about the nights
Hiding it all behind the smiles
Take a look at what you did
You probably thought that you'd break my heart
You probably thought that you'd make me cry
But baby it's okay
I swear it's okay 'Cause I know everything
I know everything
I know everything
I know everything Now these tops don't twist like they did before
Tried to keep you out
And you are done
But baby it don't hurt
Oh, like you thought it would
The more of you the merrier Now we're lying about the nights
Hiding it all behind the smiles
Take a look at what you did, hey
You probably thought that you'd break my heart
You probably thought that you'd make me cry
Baby it's okay
It's okay I know everything
I know everything
I know everything
I know everything Laissez tomber les filles

'Cause I'm not as hard as you make it seem to be It could have went so many ways
So many ways it can go
'Cause ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I'm alone

For what it's worth, I hope you enjoy the show
'Cause if you're back here
Only takin' pictures, you gon' have to take your ass home 'Cause the only thing you're takin'

I can't remember how it looks inside,
So you can picture how my life's been
I went from starin' at the same four walls for 21 years
To seein' the whole world in just twelve months
Been gone for so long I might have just found God
Well, probably not, if I keep my habits up and
Probably not if I can't keep up with lovin'
And I can't stand talkin' to brand new girls
Only bitches down to fuck when you shower them with ones and
Probably not if my niggas round them up and
Probably not if we take 'em to my spot
Probably not if I tweak all day, just to sleep at night
God damn I'm high, my doctor told me to stop
And he gave me something to pop
I mix it up with some Adderall's and I wait to get to the top
And I mix it up with some alcohol and I pour it up in a shot
I don't care about you, why you worried 'bout me?
All I want is that smoke, give me all of that smoke
Last week was my rough week, I'm still drippin' down from my nose
And I don't know how to drive, I make my driver get high
But If he goes under that 110, believe my driver get fired
And I don't got any friends,
I got XO in my bloodwork and I'm posted up down in Florida,
Ft. Lauderdale to that MIA
Cold drinks with Grand Marnier
To the break of dawn, Kahlua milk,
White Russian when the sun hits,
White Russians with tongue tricks
I like the feeling of tongue rings,
She like the way my whole tongue flip,
She grind hard for tuition,
She grind hard 'til her teeth chip
I make her hide it with gold grills,
I make her suck it with gold grills,
In the back room of the VIP, she don't ever sleep This ain't nothing to relate to

Girl I'm just trying to make you sleep without a word
Girl, I'm just trying to let you leave without a word
Without a word There comes a time in a man's life
He must take responsibility
For the choices he has made
There are certain things that he must do
Things that he must say Like I Love you
And I need you
I only want you
And nobody's goin' to know if it's true I never thought I'd feel this kind of hesitation (tonight)
My hand on another girl
I wish I didn't have to lie
I wish I could let you know 'Cause I love you
And I need you
I only want you
And nobody's going to know if it's true Valerie
I know you can see through me
Valerie
You just choose to never know
Valerie
Why pretend to trust in me?
(I don't know why you try to trust in me baby, but I think I might know )
Valerie
You'd rather this than be alone
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) 'Cause I love you
And I need you
I only want you
And nobody's going to know if it's true 'Cause I love you
And I need you
I only want you
And nobody's going to know if it's true And I love you
And I need you
I only want you
And nobody gonna know It has begun again, my friend
In this room, we are nothing but strangers in a bed
You made me fall again, my friend
How can I forget when you said love was just pretend? Well I told her I've been thinkin' 'bout her lately
But she told me that to love her is so crazy 'Cause she loves to lay
I learned the hard way
She loves to lay, I'm all to blame
I learned the hard way
She loves to lay
Know I learned the hard way
She loves to lay, it's all a game
I learned the hard way It has begun again, my friend
In your heart, we are nothing but strangers in the end Then I told her I've been thinkin' 'bout her lately
But she told me that to love her is so crazy 'Cause she loves to lay
I learned the hard way
She loves to lay, I'm all to blame
I learned the hard way
She loves to lay
Know I learned the hard way
She loves to lay, it's all a game
I learned the hard way I feel there's someone else
Worth your time, from the start
He's just one call away
From your mind, and your heart
It has begun, begun
Again, again, my friend, hey! 'Cause she loves to lay
I learned the hard way
She loves to lay, I'm all to blame
I learned the hard way
She loves to lay
Know I learned the hard way

Adjust to the fame
'Cause no one will love you like her
It's pointless, like tears in the rain
So now that she's gone
Embrace all that comes
And die with a smile, don't show the world how
Alone you've become They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
'Cause no one will love you like her
It's pointless, like tears in the rain Like tears in the rain, hmm When it's said and done
I already felt love
And I let it end up
End up dying by itself
And when it's said and done
You were better off
You deserve real love
And I deserve to be by myself
'Cause I've gone too far
And I started too young
To give up
And even if I changed
It would be too late
I exposed my ways
Now every girl I touch They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
Hoo hoo, yeah
'Cause no one will love you like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain (like tears in the rain)
So now that she's gone
Oh no
Embrace all that comes (embrace all that comes)
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become
Alone you've become
They all feel the same I should've let you leave
But, I let you, watch me slip away
I could've set you free
But, I'm selfish, I watched you stay
Oh babe She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
It's so sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
It's so sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away They all feel the same (ooh ooh ooh)
Adjust to the fame (adjusted to the fame)
'Cause no one will love you like her
It's pointless (no one's gonna love me) like tears in the rain
(No one's gonna love me no no)
So now that she's gone (oh now that she's gone, baby)
Embrace all that comes (oh embrace all that comes no, no)
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become (I'm not gonna show the world)
Oh how alone I've become oh They all feel the same (hoo hoo baby)
Hoo hoo baby
Adjust to the fame (Oh I adjust to the fame ?)
'Cause no one will love me like her

Embrace all that comes
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become now She has no recollection

With a handful of pills, no chasers
Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
And she bad in a head band
Escaping, her van is a Wonderland

Weed's nice 'cause time don't exist
And when the stars shine back to the crib
Superstar lines back at the crib
And we can test out the tables
We got some brand new tables
All glass and it's four feet wide
But it's a must to get us ten feet high
She give me sex in a handbag
I got her wetter than a wet nap
And no closed doors
So I listen to her moans echo
"I heard he do drugs now"
You heard wrong I been on them for a minute, we just never act a fool,
That's just how we fuckin' livin'
And when we act a fool, it's probably 'cause we mixed it

C'est tout ce qu'on entend.
Les jours se défilent comme de la ficelle dans le vent
Embobiné dans ma toile, je les dévoile à nouveaux
10 ans mon ami, que ne rien d'autre compte
Elle n'était qu'une gamine à ce moment
Souffrant d'un cœur brisé
Une douleur très profonde.
C'est là où je l'ai aperçue
Seule, prête à entamer ses 17 ans Tell 'em this boy was made for loving
Tell 'em this heart doesn't stay to one
I'll be the same, never changed for nothing
It's all I know, never learned much more Mama called me destructive, oh yeah
Said it ruined me one day, yeah
Cause every woman that loved me, oh yeah
Seemed to push them away That's real life, oh oh oh
Real life, ooh
Mama talking that real life, oh oh oh
That real life, real life, real life, real life I know you don't really understand it

Said it ruined me one day, yeah
Cause every woman that loved me, oh yeah
Seemed to push them away That's real life, oh oh oh
Real life, ooh
Mama talking that real life, oh oh oh

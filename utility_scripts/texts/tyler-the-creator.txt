Mula!
Like Adam in the garden of Eve
My bitch got an apple bottom and she swallow my seeds
Follow my lead, fire I breath, water my sea
And sit back and watch money grow on trees
Droppin' C's like classes, these hoes drop they asses
I drop a seed in her panties, if it smell like pansies
I'm a banshee in her panties, nigga, ask your mammy
Never played golf, but got a driver and a Caddy
Whole squad slammin' like Onyx, you no sticky fingers
Some dropped science, I'm droppin' English
Even if Tyler, named the song flower
No seeds in the bud, still don't trust bugs
I'm down [Outro: Tyler, The Creator & Lil Wayne]
Droppin' seeds on these niggas
They can't fuck with the boy [Mula!]
Droppin' seeds on these bitches
For the love of the sport
I'm droppin' seeds, got this garden
Flowers poppin' of course
I'm droppin' seeds, motherfucker
Weezy Baby the boy! Yugh! Ayo
Let take it back to them day
Counting sheep on Syd and Hannah floor
Carpet where my baby momma ate a dollar
Profit from the coffee I po'
We're in the center, calling everyday
Nobody home they knocking on the door
Now I skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Them draws the only dream I can afford
Now I roll through California I ride through California
Peace fog over goggles
I'm leaning out the window
OJ shining on me
Simpson shining on me
Slick service float and broke all this whirl
(Yeah, yeah) Run it, run it, run it, run it

I rock, I roll (Let 'em know), I bloom, I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (One more time), I bloom, I grow
(Let's go!) Ain't nobody fucking with T, but that just may be my ego
But don't be too cool you might freeze
Because niggas get stuck in the cold (Man, look at this ice)
Shit weighs a tonne, water your garden my nigga
(Stunt on these niggas)
Tell these black kids they can be who they are
Dye your hair blue, shit, I'll do it too
Look, I smell like Chanel
I never mop up with my manicured nails
I coconut oil the skin, I keep the top tho cause the follicles thinnin'
But other than that man it feels like I'm winning
But from statistics, a million are seeing in doubt because my skin is dark
Then they forget when I get in my car Peace fog over goggles
I'm leaning out the window
OJ shining on me
Simpson shining on me
Slick service float and broke off this whirl
(Yeah, yeah)
Run it, run it, run it, yuh I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (What you say?), I bloom, I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (Let 'em know), I bloom, I grow (I grow)
I rock, I roll (One more time), I bloom, I

Rooted from the bottom bloom into a tree

Keep it in my branches family could eat
Favorite color green, energy is skrong
Giving niggas life, birdie and the beast
Dropping them seeds, not what you want
You don't know what I keep in the trunk Ah, shit! Run it, run it, run it, run it

These days you gotta find time
Even the night line
Work line
Dial nine Five car garage
Full tank of the gas
But that don't mean nothin', nothin'
Nothin', nothin', without you shotgun in the passenger
I'm the loneliest man alive
But I keep on dancin' to throw 'em off
I'm gon' run out of moves 'cause I can't groove to the blues
If you know any DJs, tell 'em to call me at nine-one-one I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old lonely ass nigga (I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck)
Need to go somewhere and get some bitches or something
Weird ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely They say the loudest in the room is weak
That's what they assume, but I disagree
I say the loudest in the room
Is prolly the loneliest one in the room (that's me)
Attention seeker, public speaker
Oh my God, that boy there is so fuckin' lonely
Writin' songs about these people
Who do not exist, he's such a fuckin' phony
One thing I know, is that I wanna
Win so bad, but I'm not Chicago
Heart is low, it's real low, it's so low
You can't lift me up, I'm like Gallardo
From the start it's been real dark
It's been so dark I guess that you could call me charbroiled, huh
I'm playin' like Hasbro
I'm really Saari, call me Arto
Crashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla
I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (skrrt)
But what the fuck else do you want from me?
That is the only thing keepin' me company
Purchase some things until I'm annoyed
These items is fillin' the void
Been fillin' it for so long
I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (oh)
Current battle as an adult
My partner is a shadow
I need love, do you got some I could borrow?
Fuck it, I could find some tomorrow
Woah, but that never comes
Like a vasectomy, what have I done?
I got the talent, the face and the funds
Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (who)
Mirror, mirror on the wall (who)
The loneliest of them all (me)
Cupid actin' stupid
Do you got another number I could call?
Never had a pet
I've never had a pet
There's more fish in the sea
But I never had a goldfish to begin with
I never had a dog
So I've never been good with bitches
'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch
I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet
Treat me like direct deposit
Check in on me sometime
Ask me how I'm really doin'
So I never have to press that nine-one-one Oh! Damn! Damn! I'm a fucking walking paradox, no I'm not
Threesomes with a fucking triceratops, Reptar
Rapping as I'm mocking deaf rock stars
Wearing synthetic wigs made of Anwar's dreadlocks
Bedrock, harder than a motherfucking Flintstone
Making crack rocks out of pussy nigga fishbones
This nigga Jasper trying to get grown
About 5'7" of his bitches in my bedroom
Swallow the cinnamon, I'm a scribble this sin and shit
While Syd is telling me that she's been getting intimate with men
(Syd, shut the fuck up) Here's the number to my therapist
(Shit) Tell him all your problems, he's fucking awesome with listening Jesus called, he said he's sick of the disses
I told him to quit bitching and this isn't a fucking hotline
For a fucking shrink, sheesh I already got mine
And he's not fucking working, I think I'm wasting my damn time
I'm clocking three past six and going postal
This the revenge of the dicks, that's nine cocks that cock nines
This ain't no V Tech shit or Columbine
But after bowling, I went home for some damn Adventure Time
(What'd you do?) I slipped myself some pink Xannies
And danced around the house in all-over print panties
My mom's gone, that fucking broad will never understand me
I'm not gay, I just wanna boogie to some Marvin
(What you think of Hayley Williams?) Fuck her, Wolf Haley robbing them
I'll crash that fucking airplane that that faggot nigga B.o.B is in
And stab Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus
And won't stop until the cops come in
I'm an over achiever, so how about I start a team of leaders
And pick up Stevie Wonder to be the wide receiver
Green paper, gold teeth and pregnant golden retrievers
Is all I want, fuck money, diamonds and bitches, don't need them
But where the fat ones at? I got something to feed them
It's some cooking books, the black kids never wanted to read them
Snap back, green ch-ch-chia fucking leaves
It's been a couple months, and Tina still ain't perm her fucking weave, damn They say success is the best revenge
So I beat DeShay up with the stack of magazines I'm in
Oh, not again! Another critic writing report
I'm stabbing any blogging faggot hipster with a Pitchfork
Still suicidal I am
I'm Wolf, Tyler put this fucking knife in my hand
I'm Wolf, Ace gon' put that fucking hole in my head
And I'm Wolf, that was me who shoved a cock in your bitch
(What the fuck, man?) Fuck the fame and all the hype, G
I just want to know if my father would ever like me
But I don't give a fuck, so he's probably just like me
A motherfuckin', Goblin
(Fuck everything, man) That's what my conscience said
Then it bunny hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead
Now the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement
Actions speak louder than words, let me try this shit, dead Golden rubbers in these denim pockets (denim pockets)
On my waist, there's a black Glock (black Glock)
New girl moved on the block (on the block)
She been plottin' on my brown cock (brown cock)
Last night I slept over hers (over hers)
During sex, I overheard (I overheard)
A sword sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na
Rolled off the bed then shot back, pa-pa
Blood on the sheets probably spillin' from my gash
Looked out the glass, seen you sprintin' on the grass
A real ninja with the blade and the mask
Got them gold ninja stars and red Supreme nunchuks
Now she tryna patch me up, but
Girl, I was just tryna get a nutbust
If that's your ex, you should probably own a pistol
But I'm guessin' it's wiser to exit with dude The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Think about it, fresh out the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in your bed
But check your window, he's at your window The night light hits off, turnin' kisses to bites
I'm a down to earth nigga with intentions that's right
You'll be down in earth quicker if you diss me tonight
But I'll be the happiest if you decide to kick it tonight
We can chill and I can act like I don't wanna fuck
You can tell me all your problems like I really give one
But I give two for us 'cause you're the one that I want
Don't wanna seem like a punk pussy that sips on the punk pussy
See when I'm with my friends I just put on a front
But in the back of my top I'm writing songs about we
We as including I and yourself, making three
Little ones ? pretty hard if you ask me
You're a pretty broad in the top three
Of things that I've been waiting to come, so
Meet me by the lake around 10 and skinny dippin' and then
We can begin the pretend game, I wanna be Finn from Adventure in Time The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Think about it, fresh out the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in your bed
But check your window, he's at your window One, two, you're the girl that I want
Three, four, five, six, seven, shit
Eight is the bullets if you say no after all this
And I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin' gorgeous
Gorgeous, baby you're gorgeous
I just wanna drag you're lifeless body to the forest
And fornicate with it but that's because I'm in love with
You cunt I just wanna talk, and conversate
Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date
So just say yes, let the future fall into place
I just wanna talk, and conversate
Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date
So just say yes, let the future fall into place cunt The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Think about it, fresh out the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in your bed
But check your window, he's at your window One, two, you're the girl that I want
Three, four, five, six, seven, shit
Eight is the bullets if you say no after all this

Deep thoughts, deep thoughts
Naw, take me back to November, wassup What if Clancy fuckin' me over?
What if 'Who Dat Boy' is rhetorical and this shit is over?
What if I'm hustling backwards?
What if my accountant ain't payin' my taxes?
Fillin' his pockets, and IRS show up asking me questions
I couldn't answer 'cause I was too busy trynna make classics
What if my music too weird for the masses?
And I'm only known for tweets more than beats or
All my day ones turn to three, fours cause of track seven
Fuck, what if I get stuck? What if I got comfortable?
I gotta keep it buck fifty, what if I lost it all and
Ended up back in Ladera at them shitty apartments that's across the Bank of America
Damn, I would be hurtin', writing all of these songs
'Cause Wi-Fi wasn't working, last year in total
I put out two verses
But five seven figures since then, life's kinda perfect
Oh is it really? Oh is it really? Bitch you know the dealy
Really, Hilly, Willy, Tilly, Silly
Hold that billy how I Milly Rock
When they can't relate him, when they start to hate him
They don't drive these cars
So whats they ultimatum?
Tell me, whats your November? Is it a person?
Mine was the Summer '06, I remember the
What if I thought the brake was the gas?
What if I crashed?
What if these deep thoughts was my last?
Let me pull over, quick! And drive back to November
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the Winter, cold water, cold water

Lost my mothafuckin' mind, time travel back and help me find
Take me back take me back
Take me back take me back
"My November is right now" I wrote a song about you, I want your opinion
I consider my heart rate has slowed down at the ending
Cause the love I got for you has exceeded appearance, the lyrics
Matter of fact, I'mma just call you, so you can hear it
If you do answer, I play it to state facts
Although I already know the response you gon' say back
At that point I'll hang up, disappear and just stay back
And if you don't I'll leave a voicemail with the playback Hello, no one is available to take your call, please leave a message after the tone I never would've thought that
Feelings could get thrown in the air
Cause I accidentally caught that
I need some new boxing gloves, shit got hectic whenever I fought back
For example, ten minutes can't go past without you brushing my thoughts
That's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty four times
I think about you or something like that
Lost match, the fucking thought of you with somebody else
I don't like that cellular convo's getting left in the wrong
Cause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back
This isn't a song I just happen to rhyme when I get emo
And find time to write facts (fuck)
I love you (Can we add some more color, um, like, some more, yellow?
Yeah, that's good) I fucking hate you
But I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled
Yeah I fucking hate you
But I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled
Yeah Girl you fucking with my emotions
The fuck is all this noise about?
I even considered picking up smoking
You turned to a bitch, who let the dogs out?
But in my dog house
My bitch is the raddest
Crazy who makes me the happiest
Can make me the saddest
Look Alice
Let's get lost in your wonder-er-land fuck an atlas
You're perfectly perfect for me
What the fuck is this, practice?
Actually, if you even consider leaving
I'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathing
And you'll see the meaning of stalking
When I pop out the dark to find you
And that new dude that you're seeing with an attitude
Then proceed to fuck up your evening
Make sure you never meet again like god damn vegans
Cause when I hear your name I can not stop cheesing
I love you so much that my heart stops beating when you're leaving
And I'm grieving and my heart starts bleeding
Life without you has no god damn meaning
Sorry I'm passive aggressive for no god damn reason
It's that my mood change like these god damn seasons
I'll fall for you, but I love you I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled
Yeah The sky is falling girl let's try to catch it
The sky is falling girl let's try to catch it
The sky is falling girl let's try to catch it tonight
The sky is falling girl let's try to catch it
The sky is falling girl let's try to catch it
The sky is falling bitch let's try to catch it tonight, come on Come on baby
Even though I hate you
I still love you
I love you
And Salem I know
I'm passive aggressive (I'm sorry, fuck)
(Come here)
I like when we hold hands
(You're the best around)
See I get jealous (fuck)
And if I see that nigga (if I see him)
I just might kill him (look)
(Look I wanna strangle you, till you stop breathing)
Love, love, love
(Spend the rest of my life, looking for air)
(So you can breathe, or we can die together, you and me)
(Fuck, look)
I'm in love (love)
I'm in love (love) I fucking hate you
But I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled
Yeah Yo, so why is Samuel such a fucking dick?

Still doin' math when I miss my class
Was it Summertime '06, had the number Nine

Fresh freshman 'til they skip my ass
Senior citizen, don't forget my pass

To make, she said watch my weight
So I stayed home and start eatin' some meals
Get out of my way, way
Boy that's McLaren, that's zero to sixty in two-point-nueve, I'm gone Fuck Don't kill the rose

Garden shed, garden shed, garden shed
Garden shed for the gar√ßons
Them feelings I was guardin'
Heavy on my mind
All my friends lost
They couldn't read the signs
I didn't wanna talk and tell 'em my location
And they ain't wanna walk
Truth is, since a youth kid, thought it was a phase
Thought it'd be like the Frank, poof, gone
But, it's still goin' on
Big fan of the base 10
Polka dot nose, how it goes
Had to keep it on the subwoofer
A couple butterflies when I float
I was always like eh
Barely interested, but I bag just to brag to my boys like bruh
This is a crucial subject matter
Sensitive like cookin' batter
'Til the temperature that's risin'
Steppin' on that ladder
Tryna grab the rings of Saturn
I'm a plant it by the time you hear this
Chittin' chatter, 'bout to heat it
It will not fuckin' matter When you're having fun (fun)
When you're having fun

(Morning, morning, morning, morning)
Got some calls I can handle
But nowhere for performance
My stomach angry and yelling'

But I hate eating solo
Need someone we can loiter in parking lots
And sunsets at the border, yeah
Ringy dingy dong, I can't be alone

Time, time, time "Ride's over, we got some tickets to see s-" The day that I met you girl
I knew that it was something special
But I couldn't put my finger on it (Fuck I can't sing whatever look)
We met through mutual friends
And this is where the story and confusion begin
Cause I was in a problem but I had to pretend that I wasn't There go the police man knocking at my door
Do I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat
Or do I answer real confused like "I don't know"
Now me and she held hands and we danced, nothing more
She kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored
There's nobody at the door, man I'm so paranoid Girl you're perfect, but you're too fucking young for me
And when temptation calls (my phone), I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young
This is more than a crush, I just might be in love A six year difference is a ten year sentence
And with the pigment on my skin
I don't want to be another statistic
You bring me joy, joy, joy, joy
And you fill a void that was once missing
And I can say I'm in love There go the police man knocking at my door
Do I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat
Or do I answer real confused like "I don't know"
Now me and she held hands and we danced, nothing more
She kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored
There's nobody at the door, man I'm so paranoid Girl you're perfect, but you're too fucking young
And when temptation calls (my phone), I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young
This is more than a crush, I just might be in love When you're 35, I'll be 41
And when I'm 27, you'll be 21
Yo, this is dumb
And when that time comes for that 1-8, I'll probably run
Cause I'm fucking terrified, yo this is dumb
You should find someone else
I'm not the one for you, shit, I'm still growing up by myself
And mentally you're older than me and that shit doesn't help
Cause if they see you with T, they'll think T needs some help
So when you mention "hang," I'm thinking about a tree and a belt
And I don't want no relation, shit no relation
Ship when my dick is longer than my attention-
Span, it's gonna suck your shit
It's that kitchen fan
It splattered on me like my dick in my hand
What? I'm still fucking off, not good at ducking off
Because I found a goose that I like, but I'm still running off
She gon' want a nest, that's why I cannot get fucking caught
That's a scary word, you could save that shit for the birds
But I found my wings, fuck
(But you're too fucking young)
I really like you
(And when temptation calls, I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young)
Funny thing about this is
By the time you hear this, I'll be in the clear
It's T and Uncle Charlie
(But you're too young, but you're too young, but you're too young) Boy I know, that we could be more
Than just friends, but you're scared
Boy I know, that we could be more
Than just friends, but you're scared (I know) I know that there could be
Somethin' for you and me
What's your philosophy?
You're scared, scared
And I exit and wait a while

See the answers are all there
(But I'm just too gone to see)
You and I are cut from different fiber
(I wonder why, I wonder why, girl)
Don't be too material to see
(But I'm just too gone to see)
This world is such a struggle just to be
Fuck 'em all baby, it's just you and me But you're too fuckin' young
And girl I know that you're the one for me
Fuck

That you're the one, for me
Cause you're too fuckin' young
And girl I know that you're the one for me, yeah I rock Ayo

Counting sheep on Syd and Hannah floor
Carpet where my baby momma ate a dollar
Profit from the coffee I po'
We're in the center, calling everyday
Nobody home they knocking on the door
Now I skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt

Shit weighs a tonne, water your garden my nigga
(Stunt on these niggas)
Tell these black kids they can be who they are
Dye your hair blue, shit, I'll do it too
Look, I smell like Chanel
I never mop up with my manicured nails
I coconut oil the skin, I keep the top tho cause the follicles thinnin'
But other than that man it feels like I'm winning
But from statistics, a million are seeing in doubt because my skin is dark
Then they forget when I get in my car Peace fog over goggles
I'm leaning out the window
OJ shining on me
Simpson shining on me
Slick service float and broke off this whirl
(Yeah, yeah)
Run it, run it, run it, yuh I glow (I glow)

Kill yourself, or anyone, you don't even have the balls to begin with
What you need is me
I just want to talk to you, its been awhile since your last session
So tell me what's been going I'm not a fucking role model (I know this)
I'm a 19 year old fucking emotional coaster with pipe dreams
So Kanye tweeted tellin' people, hes bumpin' all of my shit
These motherfuckers think I'm supposed to live up to something? shit
I'm still jacking off and proceeding my life careless
And getting more pussy 'cause I tell bitches I'm Wood Harris (as you should)
LA to Paris, I'm getting these weird stares,
from skate parks and airports it's all in the air, its weird
Yonkers dropped and left their craniums mind-fucked,
now competition missing like that nigga my mom fucked
He still hasn't called me yet (it's not your fault)
That's a whole fucking different argument
Shit, I got over it
And a couple bucks in my pocket, so now I could go buy a couple hot pockets
So grandma can stop cooking those nasty ass colligreens
Pressures on me like this top hat bastard intro, how the fuck I'm gonna top that?
OK you guys caught me
I'm not a fucking rapist, or a serial killer, I lied
(You know, you just wanted attention)
I tried too hard huh?
(no)
Made a couple thou and I just don't know what to buy yet
Supreme shit is free and I don't drink so fuck a wine set
Nigga fuck a mindset, my brain is an obscenity
I'm fucked in the head, I lost my mind with my virginity
Oh, that's a triple 3-6 isn't he a devil worshiper?
'cause I'm too fucking ignorant to do some research
I'm a start a group,
so no one else gets the respect they deserve 'cause of you
(Bastard was good though)
What you think I recorded for?
To have a bunch of critics call my shit a bunch of horror core?
Like I didn't make Parade or Inglorious
'cause I'm too fuckin' scared to tell my friends the way I really fucking feel?
Of course they only listen
To lyrics about me pissing off
In the tombs of Lara Croft
I'm getting pissed off
Message boards are on my dick I need to piss away
Lemme bust one in they mouth, I know they feel the flavor
Can't they just be happy for me like, a kid with nothing living out his dreams
Why they gotta fucking hate?
I don't even skate anymore, I'm too fucking busy
I can barely kick flip now
People excited think this shit is so tight
Making me co-sign with rappers I don't even like
What the fuck you want me to do? start to gobble this mic
Start jacking em off, till his cap blasting off
Fuck that, 'cause these niggas ain't fuckin' with me
'cause I don't listen to the immortal tech of the nique
And all this underground bullshit can never gone peak
On the billboard top 20 and jam of the week
Id rather listen to Baduh and Pusha the T
And wacka flocka flame instead of that real hip hop that's full of the shit
But they wanna critique
Everything the the wolf gang has ever released
But they don't get it
'cause its not made for them
The nigga that's in the mirror rapping, its made for him
But they do not have the mindset, that is same as him
I'm not weird, your just a fagot, shame on him
I'm not homophobic fagot
What the fuck is a good performance?
I get on stage and have as much fun as I can
Who doesn't have ADD?! I don't
Therapy's been saying that niggas getting offended
They don't wanna fuck with me 'cause I do not fuck with religion
But see that's my decision you fuckers don't have to listen
And here, put this middle finger in your ear
Someone gets blamed
If some white kid had aimed
His AK-47 at forty seven kids
And I don't wanna see my name mentioned
College wasn't working
And I wasn't working
So I sat at home jerking off until my dick was hurting
But I was determined to be great
So this classes can wait
'cause those 4 days I went, I wasn't learnin' shit
Now I'm living dreams i've wanted since 8th
And I can afford to get my mother something on her birth, day
They claim the shit I say is just wrong
Like nobody has those really dark thoughts when alone
I;m just a teenager, who admits hes suicide prone
My life is doing pretty good
So that day is postponed for now
But wow, life's a cute bitch full of estrogen
And when she gives you lemons nigga throw em at pedestrians
I still live in my grandmas house
Sell out a fuckin' show in London just to end up on couches
I hate my fuckin' life, but when I make that announcement
My hero calls my phone, just to put that in doubt then
And then I am confused and I want energists out
My friends really think I'm playing when I say I need counseling
I sit in grandmothers living room and just pout and shout
Loud inside
Sometimes I just wanna die
Odd future came from the bottom
And its gonna take a couple armed armies to stop em
All you fucking lames don't have to like me
The devil doesn't wear Prada, I'm clearly in a fucking white tee Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! They say I've calmed down since the last album
Well, lick my dick, how does that sound? Um
Smell my gooch, you could kiss my buns
And I don't give a shit, bend my rectum
Somebody said bands make her dance
You think you're getting cash, no bitch, you're dumb
The only thing that you're gonna get is this dick
Wait turn this up, bitch, this my jam, (Where the drums at?)
Here, take a goddamn picture
And tell Spike Lee he's a goddamn nigger
And while you're at it, pass the lotion
And fapping and Xbox live, that fun
Before I come, I'm calling your sister
When she comes over, I take picture
Instantly put it on Instagram and suplex her off a building if I get banned Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!
Why y'all so salty, I do molly and zone
Can't agree bitch I'm on, your boy is bad to the bone Bring back the horns that was played in the beginning
And tell Tony Parker that I found his vision
And if he's tripping off my sneak dissing
Then he has to deal with me and my minions
Tryna get a Bimmer, e46
Have you heard 48, motherfucka I'm great
Golf Wang prints always cover the sleeves
From cuts from the Biebs, 'cause he's puffin' the trees, please
Fuck I look like, got a new bike tire
Never popped like the pussy on a bitch dyke
Think I give a fuck, I do, I go balls
And I bust in her jaw like (Fuck that disease!)
My urethra, hole that I pee from
Bigger than an obese snack on Aretha
Now, turn that snare down
I'm back like I'm Rosa Parks fare on the same damn bus
Like "you're going to jail now!" Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!
Why y'all so salty, I do molly and zone
Can't agree bitch I'm on, your boy is bad to the bone How much wood could a woodchuck chuck?
If a woodchuck could ever give a fuck?
Bitch suck dick, motherfuck you and your opinions, (Can you kick it?)
Yes I can sir
Where the lump is sicker than the last bar bold-er

Your boy is bad to the bone How many fags can a light bulb screw?
Well if I has a dick, they be two's and sixes
And tell the NRA I'm about to lose my shit
Shoot through Wayne Lapierre's hair with a crucifix
How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a rich nigga, huh? A little Jergens in my palm for the jerkin'
Hope my mom don't catch me, tryna set mood
Little Redtube, fuck lotion, I don't need lube, dry fit suits me
Up and down, friction with the sound, shit's kind of disgusting
Fap time and before I flatline, Clancy chimes in my room and catch me
This shit's so damn embarrassing like We can speed in my two seater
Girl I got a two seater
Speed in my two seater
In my two seater I'm about to go real fast and it's easy to stop
You see my shit isn't stock
I used to piss in a pot and now I piss on the walls
Since I pissed off a cop a couple tickets I have copped
But I can pay for them all
And by the model of my vehicle you know that I ball
A 92 but 91 the year that Tyler was spawned
And if I crash in the woods then I'mma follow with this
Like I'm tryna get stick or automatic you pick
Shit is static as shit, sure my shit is a M
Might get that X6 end don't follow exit him
Might take back street hidden house
Got sports car like like his garage is gym
Two sapphires on your neck that's his precious gems
Now AMG it's in boy I will eat him Benz
You angry you got that old shit with those deep rims
You got a warranty don't care if you scratchin' rims again We can speed in my two seater
Girl I got a two seater
Speed in my two seater
In my two seater Sit in my passenger seat
You tell me I got too much speed
And I should slow, I should slow down
But I can't, cause you drive, you wild Girl I get a rush
When we're speeding in my car
Sometimes it's too much
Just to feel the wind in my heart
Girl I get a rush
When we're speeding in my car
Sometimes it's too much I know some dudes that would find you
Can we move cause there's shouting
The fuck if it's you that's a Honda
To fucking zoom out of Mazda
Golf Wang is bad for you like the food from McDonalds
Boy I'm a king and I ain't lying boy hakuna matata
Better watch for them hyenas if they flex than it's on
Cashing so many checks there calling him Tyler O-Comma
I'm tryna ball like I was Domo Okonma but oh nada
Probably [?] boy I'm just rhyming
They saying bow, suck my genitals
Album cover looking like the mask of the timberwolves
State park at Pemberton
Hoping that I ditched the cords and go pick up the pen again
Cause I kill the dark shit like I'm motherfucking Zimmerman
Turn around and lose pounds like I'm fucking Timbaland
And by pounds I mean, give it till he cop brick like a wall with pig in it
And money coming out the blue
Like cops are changing fits or shit I'm killin' it Back left brain had the hightop fade
And we would go skate on them concrete waves
And now I switch gears to hear a cylinder pump
The beat dumb don't get it twisted boy my balls in the trunk Can you roll my window up?
The fuck you turn my music down for man?
Can you roll my window up?
Why, damn!
Cause it's windy
But I love it when your hair Blows, when it blows
When your hair blows
Hanging out the sunroof
I love it when your hair blows
When it blows, when it blows
Hanging out the sunroof
I love it when your hair blows
When it blows, when it blows
Hanging out the sunroof
Listening to Mac DeMarco
Hanging out the roof window
Switch to third gear turbo
Skrting on these niggas
Skrting on these bitches
Listening to Mac DeMarco
Hanging out the roof window
Switch to third gear turbo
Skrting on these niggas

Oh, you be trapping out the bando selling grams, huh?
Oh, you be smoking, drinking lean, and popping Xans, huh?
You see, that's the bullshit that I don't need
I'm telling y'all niggas, y'all ain't fucking with me
See, I look in the mirror and he said, "You are the man"
And I said, "Hey man, I agree" Rocks on rainbow, Ben's a nice fellow
Your neck reflects yout personality, and mine is yellow
Boy, I hit the block, like I hate Legos
They know they got thirty seconds, Jared Leto
Before they see some halos, and I reload the ammo
Boy is Golf Wang-o, and that's the squad I bang-o

We been Batmen since Batman have a sidekick
Catch me in some vans like one of them soccer mamas
And them bitches blue like that family went to the Dodgers, solve em (Oh no!)

Pink and yellow on my neck remind you of my dickhole
And I don't really fuck with you niggas, shout out to Jim Crow Don't get offended, love being darkskinned
23 with the crib and I don't got no tenants
And I don't like sports, but the court got a tennis

Teeth missing, moms' won't recognize your face when it's done

Liftoff, Power 106, Open Barm groupies
Groupies, that, that's the best y'all can come up with? Was groupies
Alright, fucking groupie (Alright fucking groupies then) [Verse 4]
I'm on the fucking bus and I just ate lunch
And I'm looking for a slut and I'm really tryna' bust a fat nut
On her motherfucking forehead, but damn, my iPhone dead, shit
I need a charger, fuck it I'll just go outside and charge a bitch
And tell the bitch to come on the bus and suck my shit
And maybe if I'm a little more horny, get little drunk, I can open up her and shit probably lick her clit
But shit, that probably won't happen, fuck
Fuckin' all this pussy off rappin', fuck
Man, they think I'm cool, they start to clappin', fuck it
Give me a hand job, yeah, I'm the man
I'm the motherfuckin' nigga that was just on stage
Bitch, open up your fucking book and let me lick that page
But wait a minute, that shit clean? Let me get spray out of the bathroom
Where I took a shit, took off my Fruit Of The Looms and took a doo-doo-doo
Poo-poo-poo, lick on your ass and poo-poo, doo-doo
You got a problem with T? Well fuckin' know a couple dudes that'll get the burner and shoot-shoot
And shoot-shoot if you got a problem, yeah bitch, get that
Get rat, nigga get that, nigga getgat, with the liklak and a Tic-Tac
Just rollin' up a zig-zag, after you suck my dick, here, take a Tic-Tac
And a fuckin' double mint, bitch I'm the devil men
Bitch know what the fuck I meant, heard Bastard
The first album, bitch, you know what the Devil meant
Jk, I'm Heaven sent, know God and a couple of angels
I'm, alright I'm off of here This is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep
Some food for thought some food for death, go 'head and fuckin' eat
My father's dead well I don't know, we'll never fuckin' meet
I cut my wrist and play piano cause I'm so depressed
Somebody call the pastor, this bastard is so posessed
This meetin' just begun, nigga I'm Satan's son My mother raised me a single parent so it's apparent
That I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckas
Are much important I'm gettin' angrier while recordin'
I'm feelin' like the Bulls, I've got a Gang of Wolves
Odd Future is children that's fucked up on they mental
Simple but probably not, fuck 'em I'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck
Drunk white girls the only way I'll get my dick sucked
Suspended from school coolest nigga without effort
Easy to spot like black bitches with fake leopard
Soak me up like a tampon, but keep the lamp on
Cause this album packs enough evil
That you can't fit inside a jansport, go to school with this I go from AP to JC inside of fuckin' week
Wakin' up with random girls like "Yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?"
I stay with grandma, she always bitchin' about her carpet
Every time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit
No to drugs I never spark it, I used to be bullied for honour classes
By those slow as molasses, take this shit to school Raquel treat me like my father like a fuckin' stranger
She still don't know I made Sarah to strangle her
Not put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler
All because she said no to homecomin', demons runnin'
Inside my head tellin' me evil thoughts
I'm the dream catcher but nothin' but nightmares I caught, go to sleep I wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky
Fuck me the monster said, some how the monster's dead
Inside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil
With this state of mind, big moves, max keeble
I'm on my grind feeble, my music is evil
My fuckin' samples are too illegal, play this shit in church I graduated without honors or a fuckin' father
He died, no bitch, don't even fuckin' bother
I wanted a brother my mother I told her
But instead I got a sister, just like me with her mister nada
So both of our imaginations are creations of the fuckin' situation
That's havin' our brains racin' like Dayton, wearin' some fuckin' heelies I know you fuckin' feel me, I want to fuckin' kill me
But times I'm so serious you think I'm silly
I'm doin' Big Style Willy couldn't touch 11-7
What's religion nigga? I am Legend
I roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition
I created O.F. cause I feel we're more talented
Than 40 year old rappers talkin' 'bout Gucci
When they have kids they haven't seen in years, impressin' their peers
With the same problem, the only way to solve them
Is to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver
Life's a salad I'mma toss it eat that shit up, Rick Ross it
Shit it out, bag it up sell it, I'm so damn rebellious
Cause my mother let me do what I want
She wasn't careless, protective she is the bear
The shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid
My father didn't give a fuck, so it's somethin' I inherit
My mother's all I have so it's never meet the parents
When Danielle or Malonda decide to fuckin' share
This confused boy, I wanna hug all ya, I???m bad for you kids to listen to
Soy is not the choice, I'm bad milk, drink it My wrist is all red from the cutter
Drippin' cold blood like the winter, the summer
Is never that's equivalent to me and Sarah
Well that's not her name, but I think this shit is clever
My niggas wanna know if I'm fuckin', if I'm kissin'
But I'm sittin' here downin' beers simply just wishin'
With tear they try to tell me but I never listen
Cause I don't give a shit like sittin' down pissin'
Eighteen, still talkin' to imaginaries
Hopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy
Losers can never win me, you can never offend me
My goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully momma will attend the
Ceremony with all my homies, I'm suicidal
This my Zombie Circus, I hope the majors heard this
Fuck a deal, I just want my father's email
So I can tell him how much I fuckin' hate him in detail Well niggas acting bitch yeah u know u smell like fish wipe these hoes like a dish,well im so fuck stupid man kill me like cupid,that nigga tyler said perm yo weave my nigga pass the weed im done listen 2 the rest of the beat cuz im bout 2 jerk off then go play golf with thurni9s...... bitch Uhh, addicts arise, when I arrive
In this cracked crack fag back slap in disguise
Fat sack of knives in the passenger side, bitch
Reach for the door, get your access denied [Tyler]
I'm not an asshole I just don't give a fuck a lot
The only time I do is when a bitch is screamin' "Tyler, stop!"
The big bad wolf to me you're just a minor fox
Red ridin' is gettin' some of this wolfly odder cock [Earl]
We the niggas you scared of, like bad dentists
Flow is anthemic, dirty like it's plants in it
Sick, spit a pandemic, crack and Cancer mixed with cannabis
To have a bitch, ready to stab a clit with some glass and shit [Tyler]
Your whole gang will be diminished, Bunch got the Brady's in it
Spit sick shit like my saliva got the rabies in it
Fuck rap, I'll be a landlord so I can rape a tenants daughter
Leave my house with a new stomach, and a baby in it [Earl]
Face it, me and Ace's is sick like malaria carriers
Jim Carrey her to the cemetary to bury her
Listen busters, scarier when I finger fuck her
After I dig her up and then eat her out with a bit of mustard [Tyler]
Took karate, mommy told me "Tyler toughen up"
Rihanna haircut, somebody tell Chris Brown to fuck me up
Had to teach the bitch manners, now I gotta learn her
I'll beat the fuck out your bitch anonymous, Ike Turner [Earl]
Over, sloppy seconds is my preference
Except for when I'm feedin' on the flesh of a pedestrian
Nessy loch monster stop! Will he though? Probably not
Silly hoes lick my balls like FIFA lollipops [Tyler]
Get the certain tingle, eatin' Haagen Dazs
With some soccer moms while they like to fuckin' sit and mingle
Watch an Animal Planet document on the Eagles
In the flyest '06 Supreme beanie, Sigel [Earl]
Your grind's feeble, I'm regal, really, I'm Willy Smith
I am Legend a Snicker dick in a vanilla chick
Come take a stab at it faggot, I preordered your casket
This is known as a classic, yeah that chapped lips crack shit [Tyler]
Hat is always forest so the bitches call me Gump
But compliment her tits and then its off to hump her
Fuck her in a hummer while I rape her and I put her in a slumber
It's not a figure of speech when I tell you that I dumped her [Earl]
No narcissists, sippin' on arsenic
Carved carcasses in the garage, don't park in it
Hard as finding retarded kids at Harvard
It's Wolf Gang barkin' keep you up like car alarms and shit [Tyler]
Over the edge, yeah I had in a potato sack
Cause I'm cold as ice like Anasia when she fuckin' Traq
I'm the type to put you down and bring myself up
So when I rape a bitch I hold her down and get my best nut [Earl]
We're reincarnation of '98 Eminem
60 Crip and Grizzly and some RMK Denim
Pay attention I'm stabbin' your women friends, like a gentlemen
Then dippin' with the fuckin' pen to go sin again [Tyler]
White girl, you can ask her what the dick be like
At monster madness doin' drive by's on a fuckin' fixie bike
Fuck it moron, snortin' oxycontin, wearin' cotton
Oxymoron like buff faggots playin' sissy dykes [Earl]
This the shit that get cripple bitches to hop
Dirty crack pipes with, bullshit to stop, ho
Boss broke, spouse choke, blouse open
Sly's little shop of horrors, now showin' [Tyler]
I hate gays, gangbangers and fuckin' jerkers
Unless it's gay gangbangers: that's fuckin' jerkers
Whoa yo, yo.. no homo, I'm not gay, faggot
Odd Future Wolf Gang, Wu-Tang bangin' in your system
Probably banging in your sister with my children swimmin' in her system
Let me say this shit in slow-mo, homo
You don't fuckin' skate, take off that Box Logo Went to six flags
Six fags came up and said "ayo can we get a pic?" I said no
And they said "oh it's wolf gang, Yonkers, goblin is my shit though"
Now I'm like, fuck, I don't want to be an asshole
So I'm sitting there posing with Travis, Devon
With a fake smile like her titties was drawing it on
So fucking annoyed because I missed Goliath
Cause some kid said I was there then they caused a riot
Now I'm surrounded by a 25 hound of fuckers tryna get a photo
All because they noticed the top with the box logo
And them fucking ears, guarantee they didn't even hear bastard
They bandwagon-jumped me from a pogo, I'm going fucking loco
"Hey Tyler can I" no, bitch, don't you see me tryna buy a fucking churro?
"But Tyler, you're my hero, I used to get bullied
Until I heard radicals, the last part got to me
See, I used to give a fuck until my cock would bleed
Now I'm the happiest I think I'll ever ever be
My life is just like yours, no father
My momma must have forgot to stop with a pop condom
In school I was the one thinking outside boxes
So everybody in them would say that I got problems
So when I heard you say it, I said it back like fuck 'em
You're in inspiration to niggas like me
Not the niggas who like you just cause of lyrics and beats
I'm talking about the niggas who don't know where they're going to be
I heard the song bastard right in the moment of heat
Not in summer, but of course I was holding a heat
Gun on the edge of my feet, I heard that first piano chord
And it drew me in like predators carrying treats
Then I said to myself fuck is he speaking to me
See me and you we go together like snare in a beat
I mean snare and a kick drum, see my forearm
I carved of on it this morning with a glass shard
On my green mini ramp that I built in my backyard (that's weird)
That's hard, that scar from playing air guitar
When I see you play at the Roxy (uh)
Tyler, I love you, I wanna be just like you (alright)
I think about your face and I don't even fucking try to (no homo)
Wish I had a basement mitt for me to hide you
We could play Xbox and listen to 'in search of' and eat donuts
Over conversating about what church does
Come up with weird ass videos with roach bugs
I'm straight edge too, so no drugs on this trip
And Raquel that bitch, you should've killed that bitch
You should've took me instead (uh, that's weird)
See, if you can't have her then he shouldn't neither
And if I can't have you then she shouldn't either
No one should see you, but me in your t-shirt
I worship you until the fucking wrinkles on my knees hurt (what the fuck)
Odd future, wolf gang, golf wang, flog gnaw, free earl mobbin'
I know it seems like just I'm slobbing on your knob
But I'm just a fan and I ain't losing my fucking noggin (yeah you are)
I ain't got a job and I went out and bought goblin about 5 times
Cause (thanks for the support) I love you man (alright)
I like tie-dyed tees or just plain white tees, I like pants that's cut
I like words like fuck, I got your pics on my wall
With the mouth cut out, now paper cuts on my balls
Cause your dicks in my jaw (what the fuck)
And I hit you on twitter about 10 minutes a day
And I'm bitter cause you don't even reply with a hey (sorry)
And my boys think I'm gay cause I play VCR
In my car all alone speakers waking up neighbors
Alright my nigga, calm down, it's getting weird, take this pic
So I can get on colossus, line as slow as molasses
(Tyler listen) no nigga I see you are loving my shit
And I appreciate the fact that you would suck on my dick
But I'm not gay so its awkward, now I'm grouchy like Oscar
After spilling some shit on his newest pair of beige dockers
Yonkers and Yonkers (I love that song)
Sick of hearing about Yonkers
I'm grateful that it worked, I attacked and I conquered
"Yeah whatever but I had a fucking blast at that concert
I was at the Boston one, I got a t-shirt from Sagan
The one that says Sagan Lockhart
And when you came out to sandwiches
That's when my fucking boycrush got started"
Just take this fucking picture man, shit Oh I don't need the metronome bro
(It's this girl) She lives next door, to the store that I loiter at
We talk every night, she cry to me about her guy
And if we text I get pissed when I get no reply
I know that she's the key to love
She is who I'm thinking of when I am beating Richard up
To mental images her face look
The closest that I got is when I'm poking her on Facebook
Video chats are so exciting
Cause it's like she is inviting me to her world full of privacy
I'm getting gassed up, I think she's liking me
She's gullible and I just wanna take it like a pirate
I see her in class
Not really two doors down but in anytime that I pass
To take a piss in a stall, I picture us in the hall
Locking lips on the wall, her hand grabbing my dick
My left hand on her tits, oh my shit's getting hard
From thoughts of dating this bitch
Her name is my passwords, fuck All my niggas got they bitches and stuff
But all the bitches they fuck, are known as bitches and sluts
But she special, I know to y'all I come off as rough
But I'm the nicest to her, and I just want to concur
A relation, I want the cheesy dates at the movies
And stupid walks on the beach, and sharing straws in a cup
I never had that, so when we holding hands walking home
I look past that, the fact that she's fucking guys that I hate
But, things are looking great cut copy
Last time we talk she said that her relationship was Rocky (Action)
Now that Mr. Fag is gone, there's no one that can stop me
From bagging her, I got these tickets to the Roxy
Next day metro's taking me home
I see her in a car at Wendy's, but she's not alone
Who's that guy? Wait, why the fuck he 'bout to kiss her?
Come to find out she got back with her nigga, damn, fuck She's so pretty, fuck self pity, I feel so shitty
I wanna text her in a jealous rage
But if she reply to say anything, I'ma smile I know
What do I do with myself, sit in my room for some days
Play Xbox and piles full of wet socks? Fuck that My nigga ask, "Ace, what happened to such and such?"
I could smother her name, and then tell him I probably fucked
Or I could tell him the truth, and just say she ain't like me much
But instead I lie and say she moved to Nebraska 'Cause when I call
I hope you pick up your phone
I'd like to talk to you
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
I hope you answer 'Cause when I call
I hope you pick up your phone
I'd like to talk to you
I hope you answer Hey dad, it's me, um
Oh, I'm Tyler, I think I be your son
Sorry, I called you the wrong name, see, my brain's splitting
Dad isn't your name, see faggot's a little more fitting
Mom was only twenty when you ain't have any fucks to spare
You Nigerian fuck, now I'm stuck with this shitty facial hair
Also stuck with a beautiful home with a case stairs
So you not being near fucking fire-started my damn career
But fuck it, I got Clancy, he, gave me the chance to see
A world I wasn't supposed to, I'm stoked that I didn't know you
But, sucks you ain't give a fuck and consider a sperm donor now
The fuck is an Okonma? I'm changing my shit to Haley
And I just ain't being passive, nigga
You're a fucking faggot, nigga
Got a show on Monday, guess who ain't getting no passes, nigga
But if I ever had the chance to ask this nigga
And call him I hope you answer
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
'Cause when I call (when I call, baby)
I hope you pick up your phone (please pick up)
I'd like to talk to you Suck my fucking dick and swallow this case of nuts
Ace hates your guts, I'm a selfish fuck
And I ain't sharing green as if I'm facing blunts
Frank is out the closet, Hodgy's an alcoholic
Syd might be bipolar, but fuck it, I couldn't call it
Supposed to be gone until November but quickly came back in August
I left two months through September to clearly remember all this
I would like to tell my grandma, but she's just nostalgic
I'll call her number
But she won't answer I hope you answer
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
'Cause when I call (when I call, baby)
I hope you pick up your phone
(I'd like to talk to you)
I hope you answer You claim to hate my fucking guts
But say I'm on an island in Thailand and I was wildin'
And, if I got stranded had to man up and hold my nuts
And hope that I could live off salt water and fucking coconuts
Phone ain't got no service this 3G is fucking worthless
Day is getting dark like the area's turning urban
You'll be fucking nervous like me inside of a church is
But, I'ma get in contact regardless, and
I hope you answer That last verse was about this girl Sawed-off I eat those
These clothes they free though
Straight from the back of the Supreme store
Don't give a fuck about these hoes (hold on, run that shit back) (This is a DJ Stank Daddy exclusive)
I want the black kids to like me for this one, man Trash Wang
Illegal CIV
Trash Wang
No
Golf Wang
Trash Wang Bitch I'm with the fucking extras
Big dog, cup full of eggnog
Don't give a fuck 'bout shit but clips and
Camp Flog Gnaw
Sawed-Off I eat those
These clothes they free though
Straight from the back of the Supreme store
Don't give a fuck about these hoes
They just slob knob in New York shows
Thirsty for the clit till I'm not flow
Frigid Jordan trip, bitch I got it poppin'
Me and Jasper goin' coffee shoppin'
Nose to the board see a lotta boxes

All I needed was a stick, grab the marshmallows
Mother fuckers getting lynched and burned
I earned it, my flog gnaw badge is looking good
On this brand new jacket
The donuts on the flag waving over the cabin
Now grab them graham crackers and pass them over here
Hurry, quickly I need a piece of Hersheys
Darker than the corners of the bushes we be lurking
I centered the mellow over the graham
Heated it too long now it's melting over my hand
Fuck it, I'll bite it, I burnt it, but I liked it
Camping with my niggas, its so fucking exciting We're making smores by the campfire
Camp flog gnaw, golf wang summer Sat by the fire, do witness gentle
Transformation cease to be mindless
Create your sweetness You remind me of my Bimmer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
You got a lot of drive I'm trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my Bimmer
See your ignition, baby girl I'm trying to key up
And your head lights are off I'm trying to see 'em
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
So let me start it up and smash Pop some tame impala, your man got a lame impala
And I'm sharing slurpees and you ain't even begin to swallow
You're fucking nuts, green top we coupled up
Run my fingers through em as you wax and buff my muffler
Cause I fingered you, you think the fucking ring is coming up?
Maybe, I don't know, I think you're chill
Riding on my pegs, and my back against your legs
And a seat belt is needed if I get between 'em, yeah You remind me of my Bimmer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
You got a lot of drive I'm trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my Bimmer
See your ignition, baby girl I'm trying to key up
And your head lights are off I'm trying to see 'em
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
So let me start it up and smash Mmmm, it'll get dark outside soon (ride for it)

You got a lot of drive I'm trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my Bimmer, smash
You remind me of my Bimmer Yo, I've seen a lot of niggas
So when them niggas start talkin' reckless, I get offended
I get it, they try to keep a image, but look a little closer
At the pictures and you see that they chameleons
How you doin'?
You in the motherfucking building?
Nigga, I'm an architect, got another crane and I don't know if I'mma park it yet
You ain't even start one yet, fuck off my property
Tell Australia I'm sneaking in with a mic in my damn hand
Instead of the vegetables that I packed in my backpack
When Marshall had this problem, what the fuck was they telling him?
Is it cause of status or his melanin lacks black? Huh?
I think people love to be mad
How can I be misogynist? I love titties and ass
How can I be homophobic when my boyfriend's a fag?
And we been hiding in the closet like our passion is fashion
Still trying to come out
Couldn't deal with niggas who decide to take the fun out
Probably cause I like to in places where the suns out
So comparing niggas lights is a motherfucking bum out
Thought y'all nudist, but y'all clothes
I was 'bout to tee off and putt-putt till the end
Now it's Anti-Golf Boys cause I don't fuck with my friends
Worse thing they gave me was an opportunity and a pen
Freedom of speech? My freedom was breached
Border Patrol put me on streets immediately
For shit I said when I was a virgin, repeatedly
Posting on Hypebeast cause nobody would listen to me
My child is product of me, very honest
Left of center, very different, they didn't want us
They didn't get us, didn't fit enough for their standards
Diverse and loud, so they ignore us
You put your life in a child that everybody hates
Now everybody hates papa despite that papa's great
But that's your favorite child boy that's your favorite one
(Kids?) Nope, I'm talking 'bout that Cherry Bomb
I don't think they hear it, I was fearing deteriorating
Almost ate my spirit til the children cheered along
Watching them sing the songs
Eyeballs inspired from Pilot to 2Seater, I couldn't steer them wrong
That's why I rode the Mclaren, couldn't stop at the Bimmer
"Tyler losing himself, and that nigga turned to a diva
Nigga preaching and smiling, nigga wilden' and breathing
Tryna inspire all the little niggas that wanna be him
But fuck that!, We want
Cats cats daddy problems
Kickflip fuck fuck, cupcakes buttrape
Golf Wang, daddy problems fag fag dad dad
Bike lake everything that I hate, plus being sad"
Y'all can cry about your year's top rap new albums
Golf did a quarter million in about two hours
Money money ain't the motive, but it is up for discussion
Niggas frontin' niggas wish that they could fuck with my production
Saying you the plug, get your chords up
I was writing string sections on my tour bus
They adore me, my little birds
Be free flap your wings, I encourage it
I wish I had fucking Xanex problem
So y'all talk about how I deep I am
Man-child in the flesh bitch I'm Peter Pan
You captain teir hook muthafuckas won't ever be the man
I got a muthafucking vision I don't see your plans
So shut your muthafucking mouth when I be speaking man
Cause T the only sober nigga that be tweaking fam I don't like rapping like that I don't want you thinking I love you cause I stay
Girl I really like you and happy we got laid
I think about your windows like two times in a day
I'm a pervert with a purpose, like priest who just got saved
Kissing, kissing, I'm on a mission of licking
The holy grail of your body, when you be kissin'
This is a kid from Africa, you, you are a kitchen
I come quicker than pitches from Sammy Sosa, you're hoping I'm joking, but first I'ma eat your pussy til you tell me you can't take it
Screaming "Stop it," don't you fake it, wanna tape it
Grab my camera
Nine months later with a Tyler baby
But that won't happen til I blow my load
I'ma eat your pussy til you tell me you can't take it
Screaming "Stop it," don't you fake it, wanna tape it
Grab my camera
Nine months later with a Tyler baby
But that won't happen til I blow my load Your pussy tighter than door hinges
I munch you like sandwiches
But not any more cause I'm on tour, so
FaceTime your clit, I will jack off my dick
I go hardship
I might need an ice pack on my wrist
Fucking, I'm pumping
You know it's coming, bust in a couple of seconds
I'm sweating, I leave you slumping
The back of my truck, butt naked, suck it out of me
Leave you with nothing, get it?
This is what you wanted, this is what you came for I'ma eat your pussy til you tell me you can't take it
Screaming "Stop it," don't you fake it, wanna tape it
Grab my camera
Nine months later with a Tyler baby
But that won't happen til I blow my load You blow me away

For the time being, can we just *be in love*
I know that it's so hard for you to be with me, but
For the time being, can we just *be in love* Hello, I'm a salesman sorta giant
I sell molly and mary and other various items
One time one guy came to where I'm residing
And I didn't invite him, so instead tried to fight him
I got violent, long story short he's not breathing
For some reason I liked it and it was really exciting
Couldn't stop the addiction, and the irony is
A couple junkies went missing and I know right where they're hiding Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope in the bag, Pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high Task force poured into my fortress
Found some lipstick, a couple corpses
Bitches was harmed and they couldn't reach the alarm
I'm ripping sockets out like I had fucking problems with arms
They found a couple portraits on the porch
But they don't check up under the floor
It's bodies and hotties and we was raging I'm gauging a shotty
Hit so many bitches I was pimping like Scotty
I'm a bull, red, piss me off
Like that lipstick position when she kissed me
So I bit 'em off, they was too soft, I'm a Wolf
And a designer mixing skin cotton leather and wool
And most people like flying kites, riding bikes in the woods
Baking cake cause its good, I mean I would if I could
But I like playing dress up and mix match
Sorry I'mma 'fess up, you aren't getting your kids back Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope in the bag, Pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna die What's in my trunk? White, girl What's in my trunk? White, girl You need a warrant, officer
You could say I kill 'em, if my product doesn't
Couple basement stairs where I drug them, down
It's pretty disgusting, finger crush your face
I'll leave you permanently blushing, blood
Nosebleed drugs, cook you in the oven Fuck, fuck you, fuck you, fuck him
Fuck everything else I can see
I know, fuck you I hate you so fucking much
I know you think I'm crazy
'Cause I think you're a fucking fag Sam the music sounds good man!
You've been practicing Thanks Sam, this is Wolf
He's new here Sup b Wolf this is Sam

Sam's gonna show you around while I fill out these last minute field trip slips, alright?
Now you guys have fun So you guys are into jazz? Look, Wolf, Prairie Dog, Ronzell
Whatever the fuck your name is
We don't fuck with you or anybody else here, alright?
You stay the fuck out of our way and we'll stay out of yours
Capisce? Um, excuse me mister but can you please turn down the lights
I don't really like all these cameras, man
And this shit just don't feel right
And I don't really wanna be rude to you, sir
But fuck you mean I can't wear my hat in here?
And you got me fucked up, if you think I care, nigga I hope you little niggas is listening
Them Golf Boys is in this bitch like an infant
The blind niggas used to make fun of my vision
And now I pay a mortage and they stuck with tuition
So special the teacher asked if I was autistic
And now I'm making plates, you just washing the dishes
So if you don't mind, get the fuck out of my kitchen
But keep your ego here so I can butt fuck your opinion
But in the meantime brainwashing millions of minions
Leader of the new school
And you will never catch me in none of their fucking shin-digs
I hope you fucking niggas is angry, pissed, and offended
In Search of, did more for me than Illmatic
That's when I realized we ain't cut from the same fabric
I made my own shit, you went out and bought yours
Man I got too much drive, motherfucker, I hate traffic
La-di-da-di, I'm going harder than coming out the closet to conservative Christian fathers
When it's a lot at stake carne asada let's be honest, I'm really morphing
Named the album Cherry Bomb because Greatest Hits sounded boring I don't like to follow the rules, she said that I must
I don't have any armpits
She wanted to talk who's in charge of this Golf shit
I said "Howdy do? How are you? I'm the sergeant"
And who I are isn't really important
My heart is as dark as a window with car tint
So hop in with your friends, yellin' out "unpark it"
And I'll do donuts until the fat one is carsick
It's young T I don't like to follow the rules
And that's just who I am
I hope you understand And I don't really think y'all cool
So give yourself a hand
No, no, give yourself a hand Better pose for that camera
Better pose, boy you better pose
And it's your life nigga I suppose
For the lights, for the camera, and the action Now you're face is meltin' from the flash of the big ol' lights
Nigga you ask for this life Welcome to death camp
Yeah, welcome to death camp
Yeah, welcome to death camp Kissing on my bean bag
Your lips half on my tongue
Moonwalk through your hair
(For the lights, and the camera, and the action)
This is fun I can tell
I don't know if you'll handle it well
Welcome to hell camp
(Lights, and the camera, and the action)
You should be mine in a way tonight
(For the lights, and the camera, and the action) Sick to my motherfucking tummy
Bitch must think I'm a motherfucking dummy
Because I dress bummy, bitch think I'm broke
Bitch, I ate one roach and I made a lot of money
Popping since Bastard, (manager) Clancy is my slave master
Thanks to them crackers, my pockets are fatter than
Excess shit that's weighting on Jasper
I've never popped a bottle, but I've fucked a couple models in Europe
Yup, and a couple of them swallowed

Came to Pitchfork with a couple Jada Pinkett signs
And said I was a racist homophobic
So I grabbed Lucas and filmed us kissing
Feelings getting caught, it's off, I'm pissing
You think I give a fuck? I ain't even stick my dick in yet
(No homo, too soon)
And while y'all are rolling doobies
I be in my bedroom scoring movies
Still, I'm sounding like a fucking newbie
Suck my dick, motherfucker, sue me
Mom got a new whip so she could scoop me

And purchasing weapons naming them and aim them in One Direction
(Wait a minute)
It sounds like midgets in a God damn speaker
Anytime you play this shit loud
But that's just me trying to get milk now
And the grunts of a God damn cow

Niggas mad at T
Where the tall freckled white boys at? 'Cause I don't fuck with niggas
That's not my homie, that's not my woadie
That's not my team, nigga, they bench-warmers
I am a stormer, I am a trooper
I am a cooper, bitter loss, as soon as I moved it
I run the business
I do not got time for niggas' opinions
They fuckin' stupid, don't need 'em, don't want 'em
I drop 'em, they're dead weight, them niggas useless
Neck heavy like mothafuckin' bad news
Thanks to Ben Baller, walkin' with a hunchback
I got a new white one that I worked hard for
So the doors on my car doin' jump jacks

Im out my nigga Slip it in her drink and in the blink
Of an eye I can make a white girl look chink
Don't know what to think, cause last time
I attempted this shit the judge ordered me to see a shrink
Started with the link, contended her to meet me
At the local Odd Future Wolf Gang skating rink
We was uniquely in sync, already fucking and we only met last week
We're both young, not yet antique
So her mindset was working for my technique
Tell her that I love her and by next week
You can hear her shriek from the gashes in her cheeks
No, I'm not a freak, I am meekly a creep that
Neighbors by the creek say that my house stinks
It reeks of a chic girl, streaks of red, even though all pussy is pink
Oblivion makes obvious seeks
Which makes meats for my obvious feasts
Used to just blot up thoughts, plot and rethink
Now I get daughters and tie them and clink
Got my dick harder than iron and zinc
Now they just rot up, arms caught in the sink
Where they get cut up to fit my physique
Critique my chic in this brand new mink, go Bitches running round, down, pussy take a trip
Make you strip, got my dick harder than the unzipped
Tyler swiftly slips his dick inside of Taylor Swift's slit
Round trip in that pussy, here comes a ticket
Film clips popping on that Canon, busting odd mind cannons
On the pill, is he real? Gaza stripping
In my living room, Wolf Gang full moon
I'm assuming mushrooms, I'm a necrolampoon
Not of Charles Mansoon, this fuck is ending soon, because I'm ejaculating Now I'd like to take this time of day to thank the Mother Earth
Letting the sun shine down on the lake while I fish the waters
Ooh, hide your daughters, hide your sisters, hell hide grandmama too
Cause the fisherman's raping everybody in the pool, he on the loose, yeah Got to wash it down, all this gold is fucking bait
Wait until you see the semen swimming, baby
Please not half the hole is great
Morals? Your body's near that coral reef
It was once upon a time you came home with me
Then the next chapter left you in my teeth
Fill your gills with goo, going deeper than Pacific Ocean
This specific motion makes this hammerhead puke
Got to wear a wetsuit, can't get seasick
I love when you're in fishnets, you want me to eat you
You're fucking wet, fish (Yeah, you feel alright?) God, goodness gracious
I can't wait to see the look on y'all niggas faces
That boy T not surprised his thoughts and chasten
Fuck them crackers up at Mountain Dew them niggas is racist
Cabbage was made, critic faggots was shook
So I told 'em that I'll exchange the word faggot with book
And all them books is pissed off and at they page in a bunch
Fuckin' attitude switch is like a book with a strife
But, I'm a fraud I pray to God when it's six triple book bashin' while
Me and my favorite archive lips tickle
Peter Parker pickle pack of peppers when the plot thickens
Tyler, The Creator fuckin' kill you with a popsicle
Cold blooded so we rock mittens so they won't find him
Not kiddin' keep the Tommy on me bitch, I'm Ms. Pickles
Said I seem off, last time that team talked
Sick of making niggas cabbage so I took the 'preme off
Should've bought some stock in it
Not Golf when the little homies don't, wait
Lets weigh my options
I bought me a mansion, that bought some attention
Give none to Hopsin
And dear Boyce Watkins
Why you mad, it's the slave in me
It's Facts boy i'm back like Rosa Parks in their favorite seat
Videos, stage dives, popups, they watching T
While y'all niggas watchin' the throne, the throne be watching me If you fuck this up
There are so many fuckin' kids right now, listenin' to this guy
Get those wings flapping motherfucker!
Cause this kid's ready to fucking fly Eenie, meenie, miney, mo, nigger nigger on the wall
Rap bars, jail bars, guys shootin' basketballs
Tyler the DARKskin, arrested in AUStin
Cops know who I was cause kids said the show was AWEsome Tyler, Tyler, I swear to, I swear to fuck! If you fucking
Do NOT fuck this up!
You have the whole world in your fucking hands How many leaders in the house?
Well can't somebody bring the mirrors out, I'm getting lonely
Likes and apologies, the snaps make it obvious
That everybody on this fucking planet lackin' confidence
How many leaders in the house? (Do not fuck this up!)
Well can't somebody bring the camera out so I can film me
See a great director nigga's vision must be blurry
Boy I give them epic shots like jaywalkin' in Missouri
Wait
How many leaders in the house?
Well can't somebody bring my album out so I can hear one
Pour me a drink, shit I don't know what to think
Cause all these niggas leaning like they Forest Whitaker's blink
Wait
How many leaders in the house?
See why nobody got they hands up, see that's the issue Good afternoon gentlemen
I am a HAM 9000 computer
My instructor was Mr.Langley
And he taught me to sing a song
If you'd like to hear it, I can sing it for you
It's called Daisy Daisy, give me your answer do
I'm half crazy all for the loving of you
It won't be a stylish marriage
And I cannot afford a carriage
But you'll look sweet on the seat
Of a bicycle built for two
We will go tandem as man and wife
Peddling the way down the road of life
When the roads dark we can all despise
There are bright lights in the dazzling eyes Daisy, Daisy Bell
Daisy, Daisy Bell
Daisy, Daisy Bell
Daisy, Daisy Bell (Daisy, Daisy, Daisy Bell)
(Daisy, Daisy, Daisy Bell)
(Daisy, Daisy, Daisy Bell)
(Daisy, Daisy, Daisy Bell)
(Daisy, Daisy, Daisy Bell)
(Daisy, Daisy, Daisy Bell)
(Daisy, Daisy, Daisy Bell)
(Daisy, Daisy, Daisy Bell)
(Daisy, Daisy, Daisy Bell) Satan's getting jealous of the wolves, the demons say they preferring us
Books on not giving a fuck is what they're referring us (Wolf Gang)
Wolves, I know you heard of us, we're murderous
And young enough to get the fucking priest to come and flirt with us
You niggas rap about fucking bitches and getting head
Instead I rap about fucking bitches and getting heads
While you niggas stacking bread, I can stack a couple dead
Bodies, making red look less of a color, more of a hobby
I'm not a rapper nor a rapist nor a racist
I fuck bitches with no permission and tend to hate shit
Brag about the actions in a rhyming pattern matter
Then proceed to sat her down when I go splatter in her chatterbox
Atta boy, Odd Future, you're not in our category
Torture with the super soaker at the Asian liquor store
This the type of shit that make a Chris Brown want to kick a whore
That make songs about the wet blockers when it rains and pours
(Umbrella) I hate this, screaming fuck patience
Got a nigga shaking like the calmest fucking Haitian
After chronic masturbation, asking where Mary-Kate went
I want to be the reasons why all lesbians hate dick
I make this damn Bullwinkle the red moose
Game of duck-duck-duck tape with a dead goose
She running 'round this motherfucking dungeon, her legs loose
Until I accidentally get the saw to her head, oops Victim, victim, honey, you're my fifth one
Honey on that topping when I stuff you in my system
Rape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends I had a threesome
You got a fucking death wish? I'm a genie, it'll get done
Nice to meet you, but it's more pleasant to eat you
With a leaf of salad and some dressing pouring out a teacup
Bitch, I'm Tyler the Creature, suck your feet up like a beach of leeches
Rubber more than the fucking bottom of a sneaker
Jeeper the fucking creeper, get your daughter and keep her
In the jeeps where the Wolf Gang rides around deeper
Take her to Ladera, now she's scared and you're embarrassed
Filled with terror, chop her legs off and tell her to run some errands
Put her eyes in a canteen, take her to the Berrics
Stare at Steve, say it costs ten to fuck Eric
Put her in the lake, her body sinks great, now it's time to fish her like Derek
Satan says we're dangerous, we're trading kids for angel dust
And snuff and sniff, and now that Michael Jackson's trying to suck our dick
Hippopot the fucking llamas, dead bodies, cheerleading squaders
Gave the team a bunch of fucking bees and the Keke Palmer
They will never catch him or catch up
They asked me what it was, I told them fuckers it was ketchup
Nutty like my Chex mix, she bleeding from her rectum
Odd Future wolves stirring ruckus, throwing sets up, yep This the type of shit that make children break in apartments
When you tell a fucking orphan you don't love them 'til they heart thin
(I hate you!) Starve her 'til I carve her then I shove her in the Rover
Where I cut her like a barber with a Parkinson's disorder
Store her in a portable freezer with me to Portland
Catch me with a bunch of fucking Mexicans crossing the border
I'll be the only wetback who ain't really touched the water
Cause I'll be too fucking busy tryna flirt with Jesus' daughter
(Fuck Mary) I'm awesome, and I fuck dolphins
Sicker than the starving Nigerian kids barfing
Odd Future Wolf Gang Nazi bar mitzvah
With your sister at the bar playing leg and arm twister
Evident that I'm the shit, I'm the Pooh like Tigger dick
I got these cracker doctors saying, "yeah Bob, this nigger's sick"
Animal safari, if I offend you I'm sorry
Because I'm the blackest skinhead since India Arie
I don't smoke weed, so no need for the matches
I said fuck coke and now I'm snorting Hitler's ashes
I plan on either dying for suicide or my asthma
Being the only bastard in a box logo casket
Rashes on my dick from licks of shishkabob Sagets
In some Kanye West glasses screaming out "fuck faggots"
Catch me in my attic taking photos of my dad's dick
Drop the beat here to make it extra climactic What the fuck?
I'm speechless, that was, fuck
Shit, Tyler, you're gonna need some help
I'm not a.. fuck it, different subject
How's that girl you were telling me about? I'm swaggin bitch, I'm iced out,

I'm icy bitch, look at my wrist, because if you do, I might
blind you bitch,
Mount everest aint fucking with my fucking wrist
Fuck global warming, this a ice age bitch Random disclaimer
Hey, don't do anything that I say in this song, okay?
It's fuckin' fiction
If anything happens, don't fuckin' blame me,
White America, fuck Bill O'Reilly
Four, three, two, one What the fuck I look like sayin' I'm sorry
To a bunch of fuckin' fags who can't potentially harm me?
I ain't never gonna bow down to your expectations
By the way, I got sixty fuckin' Wolves that'll guard me
That skate hard, Thrash black hoodies, try somethin'
Make sure your fuckin' feelings end up up in a Glad bag
Fuck all your opinions, I'm tie 'em up in a shoestring
And fuck the fat lady, it's over when all the kids sing Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
I'm fuckin' radical, nigga
Left, right, left, right Fuck cops, I'm a fuckin' rock star
Rebel and defiance makes my mothafuckin' cock hard
Fuck pigs, fuck God, God's a fuckin' retard
Fuck school, I'ma fuck up, fuck Harvard
I ain't got no fuckin' money, hey mom
I ain't got no mothafuckin' daddy, he ain't teach me shit
Child support ain't come that fagot still ain't bought me anything
Fuck the fat lady, it's over when all the kids sing Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
I'm fuckin' radical, nigga
Left, right, left, right Fuck your traditions, fuck your positions
Fuck your religion, fuck your decisions
See they're not mine so you gotta let 'em go
We can be ourselves, but you gotta let us know [Verse 1]
I don't wanna play you, I just wanna tape you undress
And then I'll lay you down and record soft porn
If it's romance then it's hardcore, if it's horror
Pop the pop corn, the thought to rape you really turns me on [Hook]
Press my buttons baby [Verse 2]
You're my favorite show, any chance I get I try to watch
Die hard fan, can't stop with the tapings
Sorta like a psycho when I can't stop with the raping
Of the VHS especially during sex baby [Hook] [Verse 3]
Ready to watch? I'mma slip it in the tape deck
But put it in slowmo, I don't wanna bust the tape yet, press play
Now this is what I call an evening
A live show, almost equivalent to screening
You're dream movie? I'm the clearest copy
Now time for Blow, I'm Johnny deep with the rarest poppy
Snort a little, now you're getting groovy
Cause I'll kill if I find out you're watching some other movies, bitch [Hook] [Verse 1]
I'd tell him to eat a dick quicker than Mexicans sprint over borders
I give a fuck like a quarter with 20 cent
At Hamptons with Fred Hampton relaxing at Happy Camper
It's the fucking financial aid at Hamptons wasn't relaxing, I'm taxing
"Fuck 'em all!" I'm chanting, don't complain I'm just ranting
Fuck ranking, I'm the best, I'm the champion's chariot
I'm a liar like Carrey in "Liar, Liar"
I'm dirtier than the sheets in the Marriott, Cable guy like Larry
Peter Pan in my youth, fucking fairies
I'm using my tooth bait to get that bitches teeth paste
Fuck it, Odd Future some Nazis, black Nazis don't copy
We perfect, you sloppy, huddled and slightly tacky
Fuck a label on my jacket, screw you like a ratchet
Screw you like a black teen on Judge Hatchett
Hang with thrashers and jackers
Drug dealers and crackers, AP students and slackers
I'm backwards like Jermaine Dupri in '93
Escaping from concentration camps with a fucking girl board and a ramp
That I ordered from CCS with some diamonds that's VVS
Like I went to Sierra Leone in a homecoming dress
With some matching pink panties, lipstick from my granny
Sup on my hat like that motherfucker friendly
White, red-headed bitch reminded me of Annie
She dyno like my state of mind, so yeah she understand me
Fuck you bunches here, never disrespect my family
That's for my little brother, sister, cousin and my auntie
Wasted fucking youth? All you old niggas antiques
We go skate, rape sluts and eat donuts from Randy
Bitches like Tia Landry watching Billy and Mandy
Motherfuckers wanna be Odd but you can't be
Sit the fuck down all you old niggas stand me, faggot [Verse 2]
I guess I got to be a fucking hand-me-down rapper
From Los Angee area anytime I'm fucking landing
Fuck 2DopeBoyz and NahRight, shout out to Hype Track
Them motherfuckers could never get rid of me
Guess I gotta do a fucking song with Dom Kennedy
Get these fucking hip hop bloggers to start feeling me
Because I'm seventeen, compose my own beats
Lyrically I'm dope enough to ass-fuck the dude who made nicotine
Maybe I should buy some Hundreds, wear some fucking skinny jeans
And follow in your footsteps like a motherfucking millipede
Centipede, make songs about Gucci and ciggaweed
Jerk with my friends like it's some motherfucking little league
No I ain't no fucking hipster, mister
No I'm not no fucking Kid Cudi, all my fucking fans love me
Collaboration hits for fans screaming fuck buddies, yo, yo [Verse 3]
I'm driving in a stolen truck, and I'm probably fucking drunk
Wasted as fuck, can't walk it out, DJ Unk
My nose is filled with coke and my license is revoked
(Shut the fuck up!) Who the fuck told me not to spoke?
Fuck everybody here, everybody vanished, I'm managed
Hop off my dick and make a fucking sandwich
Everybody listening can suck my dick in Spanish
Fuck you, faggot (fucking bastard) [Outro]
Yeah, um, as you can probably tell from listening to this record
I was, I was probably angry, probably on my period
But um, I didn't mean to offend anyone, alright, I'm lying, OF [Intro:]
They don't paint pictures, they just trace me [Verse 1:]
Odd Future, I'm your muthafuckin' sergeant
Nigga, I'm in charge, I fuck with Freshjive
Cause I get it, no charge, and BBC for the low price
No bargin', nigga that's a bargain
Cow print t-shirt like muthafuckin' dog
On the muthafuckin' farm with cockadoddle doodles
I'm making straight bitches pussy wet just like a noodle
And my dick must be dog food to these bitches' poodles
Felines on the freetime, I'm tossin' bitches' salads
And I'm eating up they croutons, Erica to Milan
We was flyin' to Milan, was supposed to go to Bangkok
Until she figured out that she don't really like to bang cock
To Soho, baby, Milo so dope
The cocaine flow, niggas spit heat, propane
Niggas get the picture, I see, why?
(They don't paint pictures, they just trace me) [Hook:]
My nigga, no hook
No hook, fuck a hook [Verse 2:]
Yo, beside me, nobody likes me
Mainly because I am not a fuckin' HypeBeast
I think Supreme suck, we gnarly on our Nikes
I can wear some Wranglers, with a fuckin' white T
Doo-rags to match, and I do sag
In fact, my hat is in tact with the Fubu poor over
Nigga, you pull over, fuck a Rover Range
And I'm driving a unicorn, plus my bitch is strange
And I'm the only fuckin' rapper without a chain
With a four finger ring like I can't spell my fuckin' name
And I go to Obama rallies screamin' out "McCain! "
Them ignorant bashin' muthafuckers is my gang
And the dirty la dera I can't forget where I came from
Nigga, you don't claim none, fan I am the teacher
White and black bitch like she's a muthafuckin' zebra
Candies in my pocket, I see you niggas on Easter [Hook] [Bridge:]
(It's gold) The gold is in the back
(It's gold) The beat's in the front
(It's gold) The beat's a fuckin' bully
(Go home) The lyric's just a punk, man
(Gold) The pink is in the sky
(That shit's gold) The gold is in my mind
(It's gold) The mind is in my gold
The beat is turnin' old, so go [Verse 3:]
Synthesizer, I'm the muthafuckin' master
Nigga, I'm a bastard, I fuck with chord keys
Cause the sound lasts longer, bass drummer song
And a hi-hat made of plastic, nigga's sound is elastic
Nigga, you can bite this, unless you wanna bite back
I didn't take my fuckin' Ritalin, this is a hype track
HypeTrack that and send it, nigga it's a sack shit
I had you motherfuckers eatin' salad like a fat bitch [Outro:]
Drop it, Ace the Creator, O.F.N, bangin' on your FM
Ace the Creator, drop the drums, nigga, thank you to HypeBeast Um, I said, the party isn't over
We can still dance, but I don't have no rhythm
So fucking take a chance with me The party isn't over, we can still dance girl
But I don't have no rhythm
So fucking take a chance with a nigga
Like me, yeah, like me Um, I said, the party isn't over
We can still dance, but I don't have no rhythm
So fucking take a chance with me The party isn't over, we can still dance girl
But I don't have no rhythm
So fucking take a chance with a nigga
Like me, yeah, like me Yeah, um
All I needed was a stick, grab the marshmallows
Mother fuckers getting lynched and burned
I earned it, my flog gnaw badge is looking good
On this brand new jacket
The donuts on the flag waving over the cabin
Now grab them graham crackers and pass them over here
Hurry, quickly I need a piece of Hersheys
Darker than the corners of the bushes we be lurking
I centered the mellow over the graham
Heated it too long now it's melting over my hand
Fuck it, I'll bite it, I burnt it, but I liked it
Camping with my niggas, its so fucking exciting We're making smores by the campfire
Camp flog gnaw, golf wang summer Sat by the fire, do witness gentle
Transformation cease to be mindless
Create your sweetness You remind me of my Bimmer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
You got a lot of drive I'm trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my Bimmer
See your ignition, baby girl I'm trying to key up
And your head lights are off I'm trying to see 'em
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
So let me start it up and smash Pop some tame impala, your man got a lame impala
And I'm sharing slurpees and you ain't even begin to swallow
You're fucking nuts, green top we coupled up
Run my fingers through em as you wax and buff my muffler
Cause I fingered you, you think the fucking ring is coming up?
Maybe, I don't know, I think you're chill
Riding on my pegs, and my back against your legs
And a seat belt is needed if I get between 'em, yeah You remind me of my Bimmer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
You got a lot of drive I'm trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my Bimmer
See your ignition, baby girl I'm trying to key up
And your head lights are off I'm trying to see 'em
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
So let me start it up and smash Mmmm, it'll get dark outside soon (ride for it)
Where the streetlights sing (ride for it)
(Ride for it)
You ain't gotta lie to kick it girl its cool

Fuck it in my white van, beat her with a nice white nightstand
Until I give her gashes where it's nothin' but the white meat
E-T-I-H, W's, double D's on her knees
White gargle yellow fuckin' bumblebees
Use whitey's as my dinner course for intercourse
So much fuckin' white make Darth Vader have a dimmer force
But of course, I'm the white boy that shows no remorse
Pull up on a stark with enough white to kill a horse
Blacc Friday, fuck a Nigga Friday, umm
Wolf Gang make a white pregnant bitch wan' abort
Bring the remainin' red and white pieces to the fort
Odd Future, there wolves bang where a couple bears hang
With a white box logo with a couple stains
From a black creampie in a whitey, make it light gray Oh wow, Obilivion stump
I do not know how that dead body got inside of my trunk
What the fuck? Gee Willikers and no I'm not drunk
I could have sworn that Budweiser can read fruit punch
Let you sip casually when you tryna lose calories
I'm not a murderer, this occurance that is happenin'
Cause sporadically damagin' my reputation
See I'm a good guy but when I see dead casualties
My penis gets erected and my nipples are such aroused
And the blouses of these bitches always end up in my house
And three hours in the showers with the corpse
I've ejaculated enough semen to sink a boat what, umm
Riley's body is entirely covered and tied up
From my desire now look at the fuckin' irony
I killed my manager with an iron
All because the bitch finally decided to fire me
Back at Travvy's house even though that faggot admires me
All because I heard that he was talkin' to Danielle
So now that I finally made that fags head handheld
He can finally help me masturbate and read fan mail
First letter says motherfucker you're dead
The king of comedy heard everythin' that you said
And Just in Time your head is mine
You crossed the fuckin' line like a dirty Mexicans
Second letter read hey son it's me
Fuck you, I'm a subject without my permission
Third letter quote hey Ace I'm addicted to coke
Wanna ask how I been so?
I make songs about shit for attention
Put them out randomly hopin' that I get some
I got problems in my head that I want, no
But I don't trust anybody, yeah no one
Savin' up 24 bullets with gun
Cause I got demons that I cannot let out, umm
Hopefully the next album can help me out
Cause I'm now, livin' this life with foolproof doubts
So, I just need someone to talk to, kinda rushed
But nobody gives a fuck, fuck it, signed anonymous For your boy
I'm watchin' Freaks and Geeks with the trampoline on the floor
I'm tryna pop the McLaren with the vertical doors nigga Money, money, money, money, money ain't the motive
What's your name again? Nobody knows it
Don't speak to me nigga, you not important
I'm focused
They say I'm nutty, picnic basket
Not short of a sandwich
A peanut butter, Boyce Watkin's a faggot
Please come and get me
Said I suck him at your neck
Like a hickey, boy I'm sicky
Like a HIV victim, man nobody fuckin' with me
I got banned from New Zealand, whitey called me demon
And a terrorist, God dammit I couldn't believe it
Ban a kid from the country, I never fall, never timber
But you fucked up as a parent, your child idol's a nigger
I clearly don't give a fuck, say you could run that shit back
And fuck your loud pack, and fuck your Snapchat
Cherry Bomb, the greatest fuckin' album since the days of sound
And that shit gon' pop just like that nigga that was never 'round
Damn, bout to drop, gas em up, thick exhaust
Young T, came quick, hard to beat, dick is soft
We ain't lyin', we the truth, call him Simba, beats his hooves
Tyler the Creator sweatin' Jesus juice
Put that fuckin' cow on my level, cause I'm raisin' the stakes
Mom I made you a promise, it's no more section 8
When we ate its the steaks, now our section is great
Cause that's the level I'm at, my niggas pass em a plate
Ye! Why, why, why?
Why don't they like me?
Cause Nike gave lot of niggas checks
But I'm the only nigga ever to check Nike Richer than white people with black kids
Scarier than black people with ideas
Nobody can tell me where I'm headin'
But I feel like Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen at my wedding
They say I'm crazy but that's the best thing going for me
You can't Lynch Marshawn, and Tom Brady throwin' to me
I made a million mistakes, but I'm successful in spite of em
I believe you like a fat trainer takin' a bite or somethin'
I wanna turn the tanks to playgrounds
I dream't of 2Pac, he asked me "are you still down?"
"Yeah my nigga", it's on, its on, its on, its on
I know they told their white daughters don't bring home Jerome
I am the free nigga archetype
I am the light and the beacon, you can ask the deacon
It's funny when you get extra money
Every joke you tell just be extra funny
I mean you can even dress extra bummy
Cocaine, bathroom break, nose extra runny
And I gave you all I got, you still want extra from me
Oxford want a full blown lecture from me
And the Lexus pull up, skrrtt like hop, I'd hopped out, wassup
Erg erg erg, step back, hold up, my leg'll be stuck
Hold up
I studied the proportions, emotions runnin' out of Autobahn
Speed level, had a drink with fear, and I was textin' God
He said "I gave you a big dick, so go extra hard" For your boy
I'm tryna pop the McLaren with the vertical doors
I'm watchin' Freaks and Geeks got a trampoline in my room
Damn Two, Three, Four
Hold your fuckin' horses
Niggas really fuckin' thought that T lost it

Anti Golf boys 'cause I don't fuck with me either

Whatchu mean? Find your wings (supposed to fly)
Find your wings (find your wings)
Hey you, whatcha doin' and why you runnin'?
Supposed to fly and take control cause you're the pilot
You can't swim, you're gonna drown, the sharks are comin'
The sky's your home, there's no limit, you know you gotta
Find your wings (fly)
Find your wings (find your wings) My lil nigga, the world is yours, birdy We can go down to the rainbows
Don't let your high keep your brain low
You're a bird
You're supposed to fly away
The way you stand there
Don't let your wings go to waste (go to waste)
The sky is your home, be free
Be free [Verse 1]
I like my girls skinny with brains
I like my hoodies fucked with lane
I like my friends imaginary with no names
And I make music for the fuck of it, no fame
Aim, shoot, the gun of love, round
Tried to find ammo but it's none around town
So I went Down South but I ended up North
Uptown sitting on Cloud 9's white porch
And of course, my car's off course
You're so white, my blinkers don't work
I'm trying to let the force be with you, I get you
Music is my first, but I contemplate divorce
You make a nigga sing songs nice
You make a nigga's night turn day
And you make the flowers sing say turn green yellow
It sucks that I didn't get the chance to say hello
I want to eat you out like jello
And mess with your body like the bass and the cello
And tell your mom I said hello, you want to go to prom? (Nigga hell no)
Fuck (Shit) and another one, there goes another one [Hook]
Another love song about shit
And I'll be rich if I get another diss
And maybe Cupid won't miss [Verse 2]
I like her L-I-K-E, the only difference is she won't fuck with me
But she will fuck with that vegetable with the hairs full of X's and O's
I want to tie her body up and throw her in my basement
Keep her there, so nobody can wonder where her face went
(Tyler, what you doing?) Shut the fuck up, you going to fucking love me bitch
Or I'm a fucking put this gun in your fucking head
But all I really want is a kiss on the cheek
In private, not public in the streets
And your cupcake i would eat and your toes
Cause I got a big fetish with the feet
I just want somebody I can see
You can be a gold digger, you ain't got to love me
I'm serious (I love you) I don't ask for much
Your heart literally is what I do want for lunch
Now this shit is turning to a habit
I'm the Burger King, I gotta have it my way
And truthfully girl you really make my day
I would probably kill myself if you told me you was gay
And I can't even look the other way
Your aura is a magnet, my eyes a metal bag, it's attractive
L-O-L laughing, you're a gold Oscar and I'm just actin'
And I want your cinema hole, and have our kids play supporting role
Climbing up the pole, Jack and the Beanstalk, bitch it's gold
And I was in loath, I would never get over you, ever, Sarah [Hook] [Verse 3]
Half your body laying on my chest
The rest is in my stomach, that's including your breast
And I'm a just take another guess
Now you probably wishing that you would have said yes
Am I crazy? Maybe, but fucked up is how I been lately
Shit, I don't give a fuck, your family looking for you, wish them good luck
Bitch, you tried to play me like a dummy
Now you stuck up in my mothafucking basement all bloody
And I'm fucking your dead body, your coochie all cummy
Looking in your dead eyes, what the fuck you want from me?
What did you want from me? What did you want from me? INSTRUMENTAL I was 16 when we first laid eyes
Scrawny little fucker yeah I was that guy
And you was down for the weekend
I was down for the greeting
And your eyes the same color shit that jasper be chiefing
Couple freckles on ya noses, roses made you blush
Gentleman I was like I wasn't trying to fuck
But it was my first official date so I was stuck like It was past curfew, and we was at the grove
And it was raining, and I had to be home
And then you grabbed my hand, talking about trying to get home safe
All I remember, was your motherfucking face, your face I play in your hair
As you rub on my ears
Then we awkwardly stare until our lips locked
Then we awkwardly stared because our lips locked
Now it's awkward in here because our lips locked
Feels like I'm floating in air
Can't believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked
Man this feels like a dream because our lips locked
You officially put my feelings inside a zip lock bag You gotta a nigga sprung, whenever I'm holding your hand
And making eye can-tact I feel like the damn man
Cause even though I am and get round of applause
I'm insecure then I start to think that I do not stand chance
But, moments, wish that I could own 'em or lease it or clone it
'Cause holding your fingertips is golden
I fucking love you, now treat my palms like a bowling ball &
Grip and keep holding on
Girl As you rub on my ears
Then we awkwardly stare until our lips locked
Then we awkwardly stared because our lips locked
Now it's awkward in here because our lips locked
Feels like I'm floating in air
Can't believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked
Man this feels like a dream because our lips locked
You officially put my feelings inside a zip lock bag You got a
Wait, don't think this is going to work
Things got complicated and a couple feelings got hurt
I haven't talked to you in a couple of days
I got too comfortable and started to think we was really a couple
But hey at least it was time spent
But by the time you will hear this you will know what these rhymes meant
But when you realize its awkward your names still my password
So I'm always fuckin' reminded
You got a nigga sprung You're my girlfriend, you're my girl (whether you like it or not)
You're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my girl girlfriend (you know I like you a lot)
You're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my girl (shit I know that you're my)
You're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my girlfriend
You're my girl
Ooh
You're my, you're my girl
Ooh girlfriend, girlfriend
You're my girlfriend, you're my girl, girlfriend you're my girl
You're my girlfriend [Intro]
Broke dick, I'm looking for a drug lord
Okay, welcome to my 12 bar (One, um.)
The beat, wears it like a kevlar
As I smoke my tree, medlar, South African
Coughing 'til there's pains in my fucking abdomen
I spit negative just like a halogen
My breeze more of a fucking masculine
The rascals win,
killing 'em all with a javelin
Snakes, I'm just rattling,
suit taylor never taddling
You niggas a bunch of squares, Madison
As far as real niggas, bitch nigga my battle's sick
On top of being talented, bitch I'm fucking passionate
I'm a golden curse, call me treacherous, treasure chest
I'll build on to the beat like tetris
Remember me? Forgetfulness, I am your correctionist
I stitched Odd and Future together like a leather vest
You fucking sweater neck, feather peck, Rosetta checks
I put together decks and push for beef, if head for less
I'm headed out to Sydney Australia with Tim Donnelly
He gets caught up at security, the TSA don't follow me
Tea parties are the shit, forty mags by the scones
I'm fighting for gun rights to shoot a nigga in his dome
Click your fucking heels, there's no place like home
Cock back and blast off written on the tombstone, ain't that a bitch
[Interlude]
That wasn't a 12 bar (Tyler, what's up, nigga?)
I can't count (What's wrong?)
[Verse 2: Tyler]
Let's see, what's wrong with me?
Might be my fucking Tourette, see?
I need a vacation cause all this shit got me stressing
So after the showers with Sandusky
Me and Sean Kingston went and rented a couple jet skis
Lionel rolled the blunts up,
so meanwhile me and Lucas getting fucked up
You can smell us coming like a faggot when he hicks up
Listening to Common's last album to get pumped up
To finally ask
*censored*
when I can get my dick sucked
You know Casey Anthony, was handling
Dropping her kids off so she could come out and dance with me
Wine in the pantry, wrestling on my trampoline
Learned some new chords while you uncreative were sampling
I'm Wolf, I.spit flow retardedly
As retarded as the sound of deaf people arguing
You hold the future of the kid you daughter's gargling
Me, I have the Odd Future mothafuckin' sargeaning
(Tyler calm the fuck down) No, I'm the fuck now
My poppa didn't give one, that's why I'm like this now
I'm still down to cut throat and if another fan asks
For a photo while I'm snacking on my pizza lunchable
I'm 'a fucking snap like Berman when he acts right
Then have a mental breakdown and proceed to use a crack pipe
OF will be done for
niggas will be dumb poor
Don't believe me, ok be right back, I'm headed to the gun store
M-16's and them 16's
came out of nowhere
Like your kid's wet dream,
what you mean old news
Oh you really need us to fucking show you
That we're harder than finding a fucking snickers bar in whole foods
In a black hoodie, nose bruised and a gold tooth
Hoping the fuckin' security guard doesn't hold you in custody
But luckily had a couple of guns with me
Like gay step mom, none of you mothafuckas can fuck with me
Vete a la casa de tu mama
No mas andan aqui con sus babosadas, que Odd Future ni que Odd Future
Yo no se que es eso, idiotas, que chingados es Odd Future
Golf Wang, Golf Tyler? A mi me vale madre
Ja. y mira esa ropa, parecen una bola de payasos mugrosos! Por favor! Got all the black bicthes mad cuz my main bitch vallina
She tryna to get her groove back like stella, grab the umbrella
When it comes to your perception of my shit I'm hellen keller
When it comes to the perfection of my shit I know you smell the RECTUM
I'm like a chromosome I always ex 'em
Like wolverine steps in attackin a deadly weapon
I'm openin a church to sell coke and led zeppelin
And fuck mary in her ass... ha ha... yo
I'm fucking Goldilocks up in the forest
In the three bear house eating their muthafuckin' porridge
I tell her it's my house, give her a tour
In my basement, and keep that bitch locked up in the storage
Rape her and record it, then edit it with more shit
Octopussy special effect, the wet bitches be banging
And please never disrespect my set with cannon
Hanging from my neck like it's a muthafuckin' circus You little niggas better check my French
You getting money better check my French

And leave it drippin green and red like it was double cheese buggers
Chewin on cum like bubble gum from hubbard
This bitch knew dick like Bubba knew shimp
(Laughing)
Yo Im seventeen, already sniffin blow
I tell my friends its asthma every time I start to itch my throat
I got a new show for MTV, "Pimp My Boat"
Because some bitch said my semen was dirty, thats silly ho
The most that they can do is find me, Im hiding
Somewhere where Chris Stokes cant find me
Oh no Mister Stokes I dont like misters no

You seem confused anyway, pressure enough?
You the type to do the choke when the pressure is up
The pressure is to pump and pressure is us
Bitches havin eargasms and the pleasure is us

Competition's competition, yo you better than us?
Digest what Im sayin? I dont think so

Pornos and hormones and boxes of DiGiorno
You homos is loco your prolly drinking cuervo
With some vatos with the door closed watchin zorro you homos I can grab the fireworks, the soda, all the cookies we can eat
Make you nauseous but be cautious, this is not Dawson's Creek
We could sneak away, fuck it, you could bring an eighth
I'm not gon' smoke but I'm just asking baby could you meet me by the lake?
Said bring a towel, well baby meet me by the lake
Bathing suit is going down, shit just meet me by the lake
We could count the shooting stars, well could you meet me by the lake?
Summer never has to end with me I'm give it to her, she wants that sumer time

Damn right she's mine, we both know it
So when we separate everything fine, her phone ringin' in her purse

Come for mines in sumer time, I'ma bust that trigger, nigga
Catch us where the beach at, she wanna go shopping
Sun down after club 'cause she like to get it popping
Sangria on my feet ma, 'cause she likes to get it popping
No ecstasy for her but she wanna get it popping
Drop topping, I measure her pleasure
Then drop in when she get out of place I quantize
She is my concubine, I am her porcupine
I poke her face her throat for taste, give me head like I'm on her mind
I know her analyzation, so when she try to fake
Summer time in the boat of love, meet me by the lake I can grab the fireworks, the soda, all the cookies we can eat
Make you nauseous but be cautious, this is not Dawson's Creek
We could sneak away, fuck it, you could bring an eighth
I'm not gon' smoke but I'm just asking baby could you meet me by the lake?
Said bring a towel, well baby meet me by the lake
Bathing suit is going down, shit just meet me by the lake
We could count the shooting stars, well could you meet me by the lake?
Summer never has to end with me I packed a couple sandwiches inside that basket
And brought some extra towels if anyone was asking
We should take a dip in that lake quick and then split
Then do something that's beyond what we both can imagine Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset
Watch the sunset (There goes the rainbow) Grab a drink, look in the sky, we never have to leave
We're here, all night ?
Look, you know, the water's pretty deep, let's go to sleep Papa ain't call even though he saw me on TV, it's all good (fuck you)
But now my balls, balls deep in this broad's jaws, swallow girl, it's just nutt
Bitches scared to let me smash on they ass
Yeah they heard I'm fuckin' nuts like the swag of a fag
Like me and Tekeli was gagging in the back of the cabin
Camp floggnaw nigga you can tell by the badge
(Pass me my inhaler)
I'm sick of hacking and coughing, I'm often this fucking awesome
I'm animals, Noah's ark, and often just rapping nonsense
Four stories in my home like "what the fuck's an apartment?"
Get shit popping like Peter's pores during puberty
And take bets on how quick Tyler can reach maturity
Cussing out Siri like a waitress with no patience
Oh, you want a tip bitch, well here's my dick for gratiturity, bitch Shut em' down!
Nigga shut em' down!
Shut em' down! I tumble crush on Hodgy's sluts, give money up then nutty, but
Professor nutty buddy clumpkin's petty when you touch his lunch
Like "what the fuck? I'm drunk as fuck," turn the fucking music up
So I can hear these stupid fucks, talk no walk, like you discussed
You talking too much, "who the fuck are you to us, uterus?"
I put that on my pubes and nuts, if I don't begin moving up, I'm shooting up
You and her, crew on turf, new dessert
I can see the bitch in a nigga through his shirt
I can smell the ho in the bitch flocking 'round my crew to flirt
It's on your shoulder, lose the dirt, yeah, it's the movement first
Fuck a human nurse, I'm ill, I use this earth to infuse the birth
Of my scrotum on the channel 10 news, my only motive is to skip to my Lou
Get hip to the pew, you can drink piss and eat a dick in a few
The sickening view, a visual woos, I eat your ribs, I'm a wolf
Then meet your kids after school and give 'em drugs cause it's cool (fucker) Shut em' down!
Nigga shut em' down!
Shut em' down! Hodgy, fuck this beat, nigga let's smoke weed
That shit I need, be the shit that's green, a little purple and pink
Get some swisher sweets, about three up, four more, then leave it be
I got a eight I could face, I got a blunt flavored grape
I hate the grape I can taste it when I'm inhaling the vapes
You can smell us in places when we walk
And our clothing is always covered in flakes
Enough for two shake blunts and "what the fuck is this?"
I think this Mary is laced, my heart is beating at paces that Pacquiao can relate
I'm Fucking faded like gradient
Shit I'm stuck like the tape that's super glued
To the center of Kelly price first waist
It's like my first date with Mrs. Mary, this shit is scary
The paranoia from this marijuana is very heavy, I'm lifted
Fainted by my fifth hit, Lionel pass the sherm
Let's use this Philly as a dipstick for this bath salt, you dipshit Come on my nigga you don't even smoke, you weak as fuck my nigga
You do not smoke, no tux my nigga, you're as weak as f your butt my nigga
Oh mark ass nigga, come oh my god, bro here comes that weak ass nigga Samuel Tall ugly nigga with lips bigger than tigger
Only blue print on these vans like I don't listen to jigger (uh)
Cotton-picking nigger, golf wang season sicker than the block
Colette and skate shops, where wolves deal 'em, (uh)
Workshop is awesome, ask dill and let's pretend like

Pulling down my zipper and she quick to say she doesn't suck

Pink haired missus, I'm her mister, sipping Slurpees, bag of chips
Now show your tits for mister fuji, take a picture, (uh)
Of is popping like a blister, need some Listerine
Spitting got us balling like we Mr. Clean's sister (uh)
Sick of being black, sipping paint thinner outta tin flask
Plotting on the babysitter before dinner, and hopefully I get her
If I don't, fuck it then, see I never simp son
Pull the opposite of Smithers, I'm done bitch Until the ozone leaves and the earth is hot
Loiter squad lurking in the parking lot
The moon not working and the stars align
I stay golden, y'all thought I was out my mind
Loiter squad lurking in the parking lot
Loiter squad lurking in the parking lot
Loiter squad lurking in the parking lot, yeah (Somebody told me)
I had a decline in the buzz, not a shocker bruh, I had the stun gun in my bum
And when I drop shit you better have a towel and a sponge
And ask why bitch, I eat a ton bucket of chum
In bikini bottom, I am the biggest problem
This shit fishy niggas dip like we were set in Harlem
Eaters turn them into nuggets like Carmelo Anthon(y)
We just sit and burn shit just like my fucking anthem I'm like goals, those is something you have to stand to reach
My campaign speech elect me, commander in chief
Respect to me is ever minor, appearances cause mass hysteria
But I'm still uncomparable, I'm like the face of America
I'm the ambassador from a land made of gold
I'm a fuckin' centerfold, I'm somethin' to behold

I'm not bipolar, see I'm just known by those couple names
I wanna tell my pops but shit, he'll probably say the same, fuck
Hated by everyone, that's the way it seems
I don't know whats shorter, his damn temper or my self esteem
I sit in my room and I listen to tunes, I'm amused alone
Because none of the cool kids would let me join a team
Depression on the stalk again
My best friend is an inhaler because it will not let me cough
Whenever I am losing oxygen, bully hand around my neck
Because he felt disrespected when I decided to talk again
I brought that on myself, see I should know my place
But not at lunchtime, see
I know better then to show my face around them
But the day I do it will be everywhere
When I share these feelings finally they gon' fucking care Grab a couple friends, start a couple riots
Crash a couple
Gather all the bullies, crush them motherfuckers
Odd future hooligans causing up a ruckus
It's us, nigga

We are the sams, and we're dead its just four of us
We come in peace we mean no harm and we're inglorious
We took their heads but we just took back what they took from us
I guess we lost ours Music had nothing to do with my final decision
I just really wanted somebody to come pay me attention
But nobody would listen, but stuffed animals that I had
Since I was a kid but I'm growing up so they missin'
I didn't mean to hurt anybody I'm sorry
I wouldn't hurt a fly or consider joining the army
I'm hardly ever angry, Toger Rabbit framed me
Momma I'm the same fucking kid that you made see?
I don't wanna go to jail I just wanna go home
And I want those fucking kids at school to just leave me alone
And I, I hear helicopters make them dip
I'm fucking reloaded I told you all that I ain't takin' shit
You better backup before this mac starts to lift up
I'll pump it like my inhaler when asthma begin to act up
The difference between us and our class is tan khakis
I got 99 problems and all of them is being happy Let's just runaway from here (cause it's not, cause it's not)
My dear (It's not, cause it's not)
What you really want girl
My heart's not sprung in love when I see you (when I see you, when I see you)

To me, to me (Let's go)
Let's move to California

I have things on my back so please don't (take the blame, I have to take the blame)
Girl, I know you ready, I can see it in your eyes
Boy, I know you're not, I can tell you're terrified
Nobody has to know and if they did, they wouldn't care
When you rub my hands switching fifth gear
Forget about it baby, let's not waste our afternoon (forget about it baby)
Cause we're gonna go fly to the moon (I wanna go fly to the moon)
Yeah, but anyway (Pack your bags, pack your bags)

Fastwind, slowwind, fuck yeah, we behaving bad, uh
Probably couldn't tell but I be blushing when you with me
When you kiss me, swear to God, blood was rushing to my chimney
Laying on my trampoline, looking at the stars
From my fake space fog machine
Now you know my arm is dead
From the push that you had
I said I loved you, said it back
Like it was scripted, instrumented, like the flavor of that lemonade
That we was sippin on our sushi-ridden dinner date
Oh, you think you special now?
Other bitches trippin' now
Cause we're fleeing to the moon
Fuck Earth, man we sick of y'all
Wings on my backs and we ain't gotta cop a ticket, nah, nah, nah Oh yeah

(It's about to start) Aw, nah
Boy don't cut that wood
Found out his flowers don't smell that good
But if they smell real good to him
Then he don't need anybody else's nose to win
Look, I am a god
No, I don't pray to society
All you other niggas wear camouflage
I'm in a field wearing pink and blue
What weak niggas see me?

Strangled in the air

They're like "this that cherry bomb" I'm a firecracker and I'm ready to blow, you fire me up, I lose control Golf 191 Okaga
Playing only classic hits Fly with the birds in the wind

Hold my hand and feel the wind
Now fasten your seatbelt and turn everything off
I got your attention, muthafucka I'm bout to take off

But I do bring a terror like I hate America
Brand new camera and a parachute

Now sit your ass down you do it three much
I'm the captain on this bitch, don't get it fucked up

You niggas know what I'm sayin'
Look, y'all be on the stupid shit

If anything happens it's one door
If I see a building, motherfucker we're done for
I'mma hit a couple of 'em up cause it's Parkour
Then I call your family and get your last wishes, nigga
And every line dirty you thought that I dug ditches
But I never give a fuck, it's like I was born dickless I don't wanna crash anymore, I don't wanna crash anymore
I just wanna soar through the space, let the wind hit my face
Til there's nothing left in the gas tank
I don't wanna crash, I don't wanna crash anymore
I don't wanna crash anymore
I just wanna soar through the space, let the wind hit my face
Til there's nothing left in the gas tank
I don't wanna crash I'm in first class but I feel like coach
Cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach I'm tryna find a place, a place where I can land at
A place where I can be
With no alphabet dictatin' where to stand at
You could buy a car, you could buy many things
You could buy happiness but you can't buy wings
You could buy a parachute, you could buy a parrot
But you can't buy a pair of wings that will dynamic
Stay cloud level That's why I'm in first class but I feel like coach I don't wanna I'm not crazy, I'm a fuck, oh shit!
Floopy goober, motherfucker, floopy fuckin' goober

I hope you puttin' some money to the side, my nigga and payin' your taxes
I hope you not incriminatin' you and your niggas on songs with you trappin'
I hope you dressin' yourself and not followin' niggas opinions on fashion
I hope them cars that you drivin' ain't rented just to get some comments on 'Gram
Oh shit, they are because you're not the man
Low self-esteem, hide it in Lean, Xan every meal

Neck heavy like mothafuckin' bad news
Thanks to Ben Baller, walkin' with a hunchback

So the doors on my car doin' jump jacks

In the choir, whores and liars, scumbags and the dirt, bitch
You told me God was the answer
When I ask him for shit, I get no answer, so God is the cancer

For some reason I couldn't get a hold of Taco and Jasper
But, I just brought all your friends to talk to you
Because, they're really worried about you
I thought it would be better if, they could talk to you It was all a dream, I used to read Complex magazines
When I rhyme I'm tryna get pictures in High Times
Smoke trees and see my dreams hanging in the sky line
Swanton bomb off the bed into a fine dime
In my mind I'm just tryna smoke the finest
And get high sticking bad hyenas in vagina's
I'm the fliest when it come to this, fire when I come to spit
I am getting higher when the lighter comes in front of this
I'm a stoner yeah, yeah, yeah you get the picture now
30 thousand feet gon' make it hard for me to simmer down
Another flight, another beat, another city, wow
Thus another couple bitches crying when I kick 'em out
Where we at? We on top of the world And five minutes from suicide, I biked it to the park
I walked onto the block, met a guy, burgundy 'Preme snap-back
Hurling himself and cars, and flirting with blond Cadillacs
All was great, all was great, Frankie had the blues in fact
Bunch of pale hipster girls, pretty, but they booty flat
Teenage males, couldn't tell, I was going through
And had a wallet full of cream, Amex Green, Beamer almost black
Parked in front the studio Bastard's recorded at
Earl, Gilbert, Tyler, Hodgy, Domo, Left, Taco, Nakel
Sydney, Lionel, Juan, Michael, Jasper, Hal and Matt
Bet I'm missing several but I had to bring that pattern back
We live inside a house that says fuck 'em on the welcome mat
Deep inside the ear canals of Bill O'Reilly's daughter that's
Where I'm at? Now where we at? Wolf Gang, where we at? Swell motions get promotions, to my whole team
Hell yeah I smoke weed 'cause I like to go green
Professor Beats educates niggas, let me proceed
Shine chandelier bright mike, if your nose bleeds
We at Randy's ordering that 306
Milk and glaze is the greed gold mix me
Your bitch is coming along, yeah she hum to my song
Singing like they were for her, but they were for the blur
No longer, but we working, premature, immature
She's unsure, I'm for sure, blouse and dress and my shirt
On the floor then pick it up, out the door, door
Chased, an imaginary friend, a reverie absorption
Impregnate the dream 'til it has an abortion
Where we at? We on top of the world Everything they say I'd never have, I'm seeing
Now, I bet they see that we balling like All-Star Weekend
Always been the most cool, they chase our shade
They say life switches pace when you got shit made
So I'm just tryna get paid, don't you remember the days
When your dreams were the only thing that kept you sane
And too often they think that they could stop me
Now every show we makin' half a Maserati
And the only thing blocking me is paparazzi
Now it's gold Rolex's if they try to clock me
Everything stays in the box like fighters in hockey
Miss me if you're thinking we slack, work hard
I got the world saying every single Friday is black
Took your bitch, you ain't getting her back, 'cause she know
Where we at nigga?
We on top of the world Where we at, niggas?
Where the fuck we at, man?
You niggas don't know me, huh
Where we at? Down to fucking Earth, huh, down to fucking Earth, huh
Fuck everybody, here goes some extra girth Sir
You fucking critics are making my nerves hurt
Since I'm saying fuck everybody I guess that I'm a fucking pervert
My window is a book and I'm a fucking crook
Stealing phones to call home but the line is off the hook
My mom ain't paid the bill, guess I can't pay it either
I ain't signed a fucking deal yet
But when I do Clancy and Dave are to take a percentages
That could pay the whole city's fucking mortgage
Hopefully I make a lot porn from touring in fucking Oregon
From playing piano organs and hopefully I can pay the bill
Shit is getting real, people begin to feel
Like I'm changing, but their complaining making big fucking deals
About some shit, they bitch and pout
(Can we get backstage man?) No, fagot, it's sold out
(Come on why you holding out, I though we was boys, without me
You wouldn't be Tyler the Creator, you're from the Dirty
I can tell whenever you perform, a leopard can't change it's spots)
But I'm a fucking unicorn (Whatever man)
Look, you can't stop me, I'm going full monty
Fuck that, I'm Hitler, everyone's a fucking Nazi
Wolf Gi-di-dang you be roaming where the fox be
And I be where, anybody cares
I try to preach "Fuck age, live dreams and have fun"
(Here's some give a fuck, cake) Oh, maybe I should have some
(Asshole, have none) How can I wake up on the wrong side
Of the bed, when I don't even fucking have one?
When I'm on that stage I feel important
A whole fucking assortment of children that's taking Ritalin
Because the teacher said that the therapist wasn't feeling him
You gotta be fucking kidding me
At school I was a zero, now I'm every boy's hero
And they fear it when they hear it when that little fucker's reciting my lyrics
Yeah rebel nigga cheer it, dead parents everywhere, it's smelling like teen spirit
Okay, fuck it, Elvis has left the building Verse 1
Hey You
Looking good in that skirt, flirting is the effect, the way that this works
BINGO, Shipow, how about we go, down to the lake and eat a couple of Pringles
Picnic, by the way, hey, I'm single
Pardon my bad manners, french and lingo
Intentions were, my intentions were, brighter than the summer
Reflection in the lake being seen by Stevie
You're a golden lady and it seems that me and you was sposed to be the ozone team
but who, would have thought this conversation would out grew [Verse 1: Tyler]
I'm Tyler, Mr. Green Hat, pro-abortion anti-clean rap
Fuck your blog opinion and your feedback
My self-respect I leave that, in the lost and found
Where the black girls get their weaves back
Awesome I achieve that mini, blasting "You're a jerk"
In some fucking yellow skinnies looking like a fucking faggot
Bouncing round the house trying to find an easy way to rape Minnie
Bet you thirty dollars you find her like Cartman found Kenny, dead
I like my girls smart, skinny
Kinda pop tart, when I bite into them red
I'm a self-racist, you should tape this, ask Sarah, I'm the rapist
I'm a fascist, fuck fashion, Gucci belts is for them faggots
My hat is by Jabbia and if you got a fucking problem
With the future, you can get a death wish just like Atiba
Fuck the biz apparent, Odd Future errant
I'm watching the Berrics getting head from someone's parent
Blind fucking hate inside my heart, guaranteed
That I'm sharing in the force with the cyclops staring
I'm flying on a beaver, you're a disbeliever
So don't ask for no mothafucking ride when you see us
Swim right past you, the shit-list said that I'm nutty such a cashew
Cause I jack off with dish soap and smell gas fumes
Permanent brain damage similar to tattoos
The shit, you can mention me if anybody ask you
Kill the jungle let the cats loose
You didn't see me here if someone ask you [Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I want to feel her in every way
Mary Jane keeps me high like every day
Bong, vaporizer, in the sack now
Stuck in my high, afraid of heights, I'm trapped
Buy a swisher for a dollar or two blunt wraps
Roll it up and ensure that everything's fat
She ain't got time to try and relieve ya
But she'll get all in your head, Sativa [Verse 3: BranDun Deshay]
I'm good but y'all don't want me like vegetables
I'm all in front of you zeroes like decimals
Let's take them high like the decibels
So we get them high, get them high like cholesterol
In a overweight mother-lover, my tracks is filled with blubber
That's fat, who needs another producer?
Chica-Go-Getter from Odd Future, used to ride solo
Cause I ain't really care what the rest say
Type of nigga to jerk off to his own sex tape
Best stay away when the door closed, I show up with four hoes
Best believe I'm leaving with more of those
And I got a girlfriend so I'm a keep lying until the verse end, FIN
Brandun Deshay, Hodgy Beats, Ace the Creator
Odd Future, O.F. until, until from now until forever [Alt. Verse 3: Mike G]
We grind, these niggas asking for some promo
We sit back, observe, stacking hella box logos
Square circle jerks starting O.F. moshpit
Preaching to the poets, I'm an O.F. prophet
No less profit, themed when we drop shit
Convertible coupe, bitches scream when they tops split
It's that crack, give you something to sell
Put these bitches on lock down, something like jail
Thought she hot I swear, probably rougher than hell
And she ain't gay, but the only thing she like is fucking Chanel
Light skinned women, all sex everything
Think we can fit ten in, bowls packed with everything
Everything that we call flight, living life
This is everything that we call hype
I'm everything that they call nice
She in colors and shit, she off that northern lights, right
Intimidated by niggas you can't be
I'm a G, and this is something you can't see
Top ranked, number one my son
And she looking for them trees, baby we got some
And stay focused on the women and you get less done
It's ironic cause I always hear you talking about one
Them other niggas smoke, they ain't this high
How high? Nigga, higher than the kites they fly Nigga this is my cup, drink the cyanide up
Dope as fuck so I would really shoot a group of guys up
Deep thought, I'm often lost (Fuck it) put me next to awesome
Still can't tell the difference, just like Asians with their eyes shut
Butt fuck a couple rocks, in the Wendy's parking lot
Barking at the sight of light from my bright sparkling
Cock-a-doodle, eatin' toaster strudel at a nude beach in Rome
In a black-pink spaghetti strap, made of Roman noodles
My bitch is bad, mixed with a thicky ass
Get my dicky rocky this will end up in a sticky blast
Chrissy Brown, mask on my face, now I'm kicking ass
Life's a bitch, fuck college, mommy I am ditching class
I rather be happy then fucking forty
So fuck the teacher's lecture I'm having Sydney record me
For the 2Dope (They didn't like it)
Oh well, let's get XXL to write us a fucking story It's sitting right in my lap I see it, scribbled across the lines I read it
I'm the fucking poet who knows it, you know it, you bogus
Comprehend the language, you scared of war?
I'm all anxious, we got the Angus if you want beef
Now that's a burger for ya ass nigga (Slice the onions)
Now that's a burger for ya ass nigga (Put on the cheese)
Now that's a burger for ya ass nigga (Where's the barbecue sauce?)
Now have that burger eat it fast nigga Fucking all, get you some, obviously intended pun
Same time it took, Jason Dill to get the stitching done
Custom made, one of one, sold out Roxy for some months
Ski mask color of a pickle just to perform Sandwitches
Started back in fucking London cracker children wanted something
They could bump and punch a bunch and fuck a face stumble
Now, moshing pits to breaking arms, Zombie Circus not a carn
Evil wolfs is on the farm and were all evil harmed?
Any sheep creep, quiet tendered sleep
Make a peep, fucking body will go missing in a week
Roam around the city with her titties like a fucking greek
God, Bastard was the fucking shit, explains why it never leaked
I am coming of my age with my Memphis Bleek
Shooting from the sky, the only problem is the missing beak
(Once I have my wings and my motherfucking chain)
Oh that's the black talk you give me, let me down a couple cups of bleach It's sitting right in my lap I see it, scribbled across the lines I read it
I'm the fucking poet who knows it, you know it, you bogus
Comprehend the language, you scared of war?
I'm all anxious, we got the Angus if you want beef
Now that's a burger for ya ass nigga (Slice the onions)
Now that's a burger for ya ass nigga (Put on the cheese)
Now that's a burger for ya ass nigga (Where's the barbecue sauce?)
Now have that burger eat it fast nigga Free Earl, that's the fucking shit
And if you disagree, lick a couple pimple covered clits
From some stripping lesbian dikes that fight niggas
That like to rap about those dikes that fight niggas
Alright, enough with this shit, let's talk business
Acquire more currency, disregard bitches
Go to Shake house and play Goblin in his kitchen
Then force him and his mom to listen to track six then
If he doesn't like it I'll just slice his fucking dick and
Put it in the cabinet where the fucking cookies and chips is
Take a bunch of pictures and post them on my Twitters and
Go to Jimmy Fallon like fagot when we perfomin'
Then a bunch of Golf Wang niggas start stormin' on the stage
In a rage that will scare Zack Rocha
Better get ya tanks before this wolf wars over
History repeats itself, I'm a O.F. soldier

I bruise you
You bruise me
We both bruise too easily
Too easily to let it show
I love you and that's all I know All my plans
Have fallen through
All my plans depend on you
Depend on you to help them grow
I love you and that's all I know When the singer's gone
Let the song go on... But the ending always comes at last
Endings always come too fast
They come too fast
But they pass to slow
I love you and that's all I know When the singer's gone
Let the song go on
It's a fine line between the darkness and the dawn
They say in the darkest night, there's a light beyond But the ending always comes at last
Endings always come too fast
They come too fast
But they pass to slow
I love you and that's all I know That's all I know
That's all I know... Is it a kind of dream
Floating out on the tide
Following the river of death downstream?
Oh, is it a dream? There's a fog along the horizon
A strange glow in the sky
And nobody seems to know where you go
And what does it mean?
Oh, is it a dream? Bright eyes
Burning like fire.
Bright eyes
How can you close and fail?
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale?
Bright eyes. Is it a kind of shadow
Reaching into the night
Wandering over the hills unseen
Or is it a dream? There's a high wind in the trees
A cold sound in the air
And nobody ever knows when you go
And where do you start
Oh, into the dark. Bright eyes
burning like fire.
Bright eyes
how can you close and fail?
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale?
bright eyes. Bright eyes
burning like fire.
Bright eyes
how can you close and fail?
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale?
Bright eyes. A stick, a stone, it's the end of the road,
It's the rest of a stump, it's a little alone,
It's a sliver of glass, it is life, it's the sun,
It is night, it is death, it's a trap, it's a gun.
The oak when it blooms, a fox in the brush,
The nod of the wood, the song of a thrush,
The wood of the wing, a cliff, a fall,
A scratch, a lump, it is nothing at all.
It's the wind blowing free, it's the end of a slope,
It's a bean, it's a void, it's a hunch, it's a hope.
And the riverbank talks of the Waters of March,
It's the end of the strain, it's the joy in your heart.
The foot, the ground, the flesh and the bone,
The beat of the road, a sling-shot stone,
A truckload of bricks in the soft morning light,
The shot of a gun in the dead of the night.
A mile, a must, a thrust, a bump,
It's a girl, it's a rhyme, it's a cold, it's the mumps.
The plan of the house, the body in bed,
And the car that got stuck, it's the mud, it's the mud.
Afloat, adrift, a flight, a wing,
A cock, a quail, the promise of spring.
And the riverbank talks of the Waters of March,
It's the promise of life, it's the joy in your heart.
A point, a grain, a bee, a bite,
A blink, a buzzard, a sudden stroke of night,
A pin, a needle, a sting, a pain,
A snail, a riddle, a wasp, a stain.
A snake, a stick, it is John, it is Joe,
A fish, a flash, a silvery glow.
And the riverbank talks of the Waters of March,
It's the promise of life in your heart, in your heart.
A stick, a stone, the end of the load,
The rest of a stump, a lonesome road.
A sliver of glass, a life, the sun,
A night, a death, the end of the run.
And the riverbank talks of the Waters of March,
It's the end of all strain, it's the joy in your heart. What a wonderful, wonderful world this would be
What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world Don't know much about history
Don't know much biology
Don't know much about a science book
Don't know much about the French I took
(But I do know)
But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me, too
What a wonderful, wonderful world this would be Don't know much about geography
Don't know much trigonometry
Don't know much about algebra
I don't know what a slide rule is for
(But I do know)
But I do know "one and one is two"
And if this one could be with you
(A wonderful world) 
What a wonderful, wonderful world this would be
What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world Now I don't claim to be an 'A' student,
But I'm tryin' to be
I think that maybe by bein' an 'A'-student, baby-baby
I could win your love for me Don't know much about the Middle Ages
Looked at the pictures then I turned the pages
Don't know nothin' 'bout no "Rise and fall"
Don't know nothin' 'bout nothin' at all
(But I do know)
Girl it's you that I've been thinkin' of
And if I could only win your love (oh girl)
What a wonderful, (what a) wonderful world this would be
What a wonderful, wonderful world this would be What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world
What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world I bruise you

What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world I met you once before the first time
Cinema 1 or 2, I noticed you
Standing in line, your eyes met mine
And I could not look away There we were, in a perfect moment
A perfect moment in time
For a moment, you were mine So later on I knew the first time
That it would be alright for us that night
Trust in our eyes, we made a bridge of sighs
When we crossed over it was day There we were, in a perfect moment
A perfect moment in time
For a moment, you were mine I wasn't ready for the last time
But wasn't I supposed to let you go into the blue?
But still I'm holding you
Though you're a million miles away There we were, in a perfect moment
A perfect moment in time
For a moment, you were mine In a perfect moment
A perfect moment in time
For the moment, you are mine
For a moment, you are mine
Just for a moment, you were mine New York
To that tall skyline I come
Flyin' in from London
To your door New York
Lookin' down on Central Park
Where they say you should not wander after dark New York
Like a scene from all those movies
But you're real enough to me
There's a heart
A heart that lives in New York A heart in New York, a rose on the street
I write my song to that city heartbeat
A heart in New York, the love in her eyes
An open door and a friend for the night New York
You've got money on your mind
And my words don't make a dime's worth of difference
So here's to you New York I watch the distant lights on the runway
Disappear into the evening sky
Oh you know I'm with you on your journey
Never could say goodbye It's not the sun you're trying to find
Something else is on your mind
You need a little space and time
To break away
It's not the place you're going to
It's just a phase you're going through
Though I won't stop you I don't want you to Break awa-a-a-a-ay
Fly across your ocean
Break awa-a-a-a-ay
Time has come for you
Break awa-a-a-a-ay
Fly across your ocean
Break awa-a-a-a-ay
Time has come For you to awaken in another country Greet the morning under foreign skies
Leaving me to face another Monday
It's not easy to get by It's not the sun you're trying to find
Something else is on your mind
You need a little space and time
To break away
It's not the place you're going to
It's just a phase you're going through
Though I won't stop you I don't want you to Break awa-a-a-a-ay
Fly across your ocean
Break awa-(breakaway)-a-ay
Time has come for you
Break awa-(breakaway)-a-ay
Fly across your ocean
Break awa-(breakaway)-a-ay
Time has come for you Lenas been burning both ends of her candle.
Shes over her head in complication and scandal.
But Lena takes her troubles in stride.
As she runs to the bottle,
To confess and confide,
Lena surrenders.
Lena has taken to flaunting her passions
Offers herself in the boldest of fashion
But Lena says its under control
As she looks to the bottle,
To calm and console,
Lena surrenders
Lena,
Surely you dont believe,
By hiding in bottles youll ever relieve
All the pain love has brought you:
The fire and the cold.
Lena,
Take heart,
Take heart
Lena,
Surely you dont believe,
By hiding in bottles youll ever relieve
All the pain love has brought you:
The fire and the cold.
Lena,
Take heart.
Take heart.
Take heart.
Take heart.
Lena!
Lena!
Take heart.
Lena!
Lena I shall sing
sing my song
Be it right
be it wrong
In the night
in the day
Anyhow
anyway.
I shall sing La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La
La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La
La-La-La... With my heart
with my soul
for the young
for the old
When I'm high
when I'm low
When I'm fast
when I'm slow
Who ah
I shall sing La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La
La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La
La-La-La... I shall sing
sing my song
Be it right
be it wrong
In the night
in the day
Anyhow
anyway.
I shall sing La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La
La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La
La-La-La... Clearing skies and drying eyes, now I see your smile.
Darkness goes and softness shows a changing style.
Just in time, words that rhyme, well bless your soul.
Now I'll fill your hands with kisses and a Tootsie Roll.
Reality, it's not for me and it makes me laugh.
But fantasy world and Disney Girls, I'm coming back. Patti Page and summer days on old Cape Cod.
Happy times and making wine in my garage.
Country shade and lemonade, guess I'm slowing down.
It's a turn-back world with a local girl in a smaller town.
Open cars, and clearer stars, that's what I lack.
But fantasy world and Disney Girls, I'm coming back. 
Mom, hi, Rick and Dave, hi, Pop, well good morning, Mom!
Love, get up! Guess what? I'm in love with a girl I found.
She's really swell cause she likes church bingo chances and old time dances. All my life I spent the nights with dreams of you.
The warmth I missed for the things I wished are coming true.
I got my love to give and a place to live, guess I'm gonna stay.
It'd be a peaceful life with a forever wife and a kid some day.
It's early nights and pillow fights and your soft laugh.
But fantasy world and Disney Girls, I'm coming back. Close your eyes, my pretty child
Though the night is dark and the wind is wild
I will stand beside your bed
Tonight there is nothing you need fear or dread You can sleep now, go to sleep
The rain falls and the windows weep
I'm standing by to sing a lullaby Close your eyes, my sister fair
Though the snow is falling and the trees are bare
And I will hold you by the hand
Tonight there is nothing you need try to understand You can sleep now, go to sleep
The daytime's dyin' and the night time's so deep
I'm standing by to sing a lullaby Close your eyes, my mother wise
When the waves are angry and the north train cries
I stop those ghosts outside your door
Mama, don't worry 'bout those ghosts no more You can sleep now, go to sleep
Tomorrow comes but it will keep
I'm standing by to sing a lullaby
Another lullaby, another lullaby, another lullaby Everyone has gone away,
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
No one cared enough to stay,
Can you hear me? You must remember me, old man,
I know that you can if you try,
So just open up your eyes, old man,
Look who's come to say, good-bye. The sun has left the sky, old man,
The birds have flown away,
And no one came to cry old man,
Good-bye, old man, good-bye. You want to stay, I know you do,
But it ain't no use to try,
'Cause i'll be here, and I'm just like you.
Good-bye, old man, good-bye. Won't be no god to comfort you,
You taught me not to believe that lie.
You don't need anybody,
Nobody needs you,
Don't cry, old man, don't cry.
Everybody dies. Funny how we're all so blind,
Love is gentle, love is kind in the nighttime.
Funny we can be so sad,
It doesn't have to be so bad in the daytime.
You want to know, where do the songs all go in your lifetime?
One of these days we'll go and find out where they stay. Once upon a lover's song,
There was a boy who sang along in the nighttime.
Once upon a lover's dream,
There was a tale of broken wings in the daytime.
You want to know, where do the songs all go in your lifetime?
One of these days we'll go and find out where they stay. And I Know, love will come someday.
And I Know, love will find a way.
And I Know, love will come some way.
And I Know, love will change your day.
The songs that I bring, the songs that I sing yeah. Catch a piece of falling star,
Try to keep it in a jar till the morning.
Catch a summer firefly,
Pray that it'll stay alive till the dawning'.
You want to know, where do the songs all go in your lifetime?
One of these days we'll go and find out where they stay. And I Know, love will come someday.
And I Know, love will find a way.
And I Know, love will come some way.
And I Know, love will change your day.
The songs that I bring, the songs that I sing
Love will come some day. And I Know, love will find a way.
And I Know, love will come some way.
And I Know, love will change your day.
And I Know, love will come some day.
And I Know, love will find a way.
And I Know, love will come some way.
And I Know, love will change your day.
And I Know What a wonderful, wonderful world this would be
What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world Don't know much about history
Don't know much biology
Don't know much about a science fic
Don't know much about the French I took
(But I do know)

Don't know nothin' 'bout no rise and fall
Don't know nothin' 'bout nothin' at all
(But I do know)
Girl it's you that I've been thinkin' of
And if I could only win your love, oh girl What a wonderful, what a wonderful world this would be
What a wonderful, wonderful world this would be
What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world
What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world
What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world
What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world Mary was an only child,
Nobody held her, nobody smiled.
She was born in a trailer, wretched and poor,
And she shone like a gem in a five and dime store. Mary had no friends at all,
Just famous faces pinned to the wall.
All of them watched her, none of them saw
That she shone like a gem in a five and dime store. And if you watch the stars at night,
And find them shining equally bright,
You might have seen Jesus and not have known what you saw.
Who would notice a gem in a five and dime store? I've been watching you
Holding on for me
But through the waiting and the wonder
Somehow you still believe
If your faith is strong
Someday you will find
It may not be like you expect it
But I will come to you
In a perfect time Chorus:
You may be waiting for the fire
When I'm calling through the rain
You may be listening for the thunder
While I'm whispering your name
You may be searching for a sign
To let you know that it's okay
Hold on
Cause I'm on my way I came to Abraham
I was the sacrifice
And forty years I walked with Moses
Through the wilderness of life
I came to Bethlehem
I saw them crucify the lamb
And as I rolled away the stone
I heard Him say
That He's coming back again Repeat Chorus My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you Are the stars out tonight?
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you, dear The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
'Cause I only have eyes for you I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue You are here, so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
'Cause I only have eyes for you You are here, so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue You are here, so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you Then Gabriel came and said to Joseph alone
"Do not be afraid to make Mary your own
But go to your betrothed and then be married
The child is Heaven sent" And it came to pass
That there went out a decree
From Caesar Augustus
That all the world would be taxed And each went to be taxed to his own city
So Joseph also went
With his lady innocent
With his lady innocent The lions in the mountains
Let them pass and followed
Close by night to guard them From Galilee to Bethlehem
She journeyed with only a donkey to ride
With Joseph walking beside
Came to David's city While she was great with child
Through a country dark and wild
Through a country dark and wild And on the far horizon
Rose a strange and brilliant
Star as though to guide them I wonder why it is the sky's so quiet tonight,
there's not a cloud in sight,
just burning stars.
it seems strange to me, the way the waves obey
the moon that shines above
and draws them to eternity.
i wonder why it is that you are here with me,
i wonder why.
I wonder why it is the sea's so calm tonight,
the sands are ghostly white
beneath the moon.
it seems strange to me to stand in endless space,
and know that in this place
i'm held within its timeless sway.
i wonder why it is that you are here with me.
i wonder why.
The wisdom of the world with all its mystery
is strangely haunting me on this great shore.
i know no book can teach, but i can feel tonight,
the sky above, the sea below,
and you my love.
tonight the world is mine, we're on the edge of time.
i wonder why.
i wonder why it is the sky's so quiet tonight,
there's not a cloud in sight,
just burning stars.
it seems strange to me, that breeze in holy light,
we soar in wingless flight,
amidst this vast eternity.
tonight this world of mine is on the edge of time,
i wonder why.
i wonder why.
i wonder why.
i wonder why. (Norma Sallitt) Well the rain's fallin' down around you,
So you cry yourself to sleep.
I know love hurts when one doesn't love as deep.
You're feelin' lost and empty,
'Cause you gave yourself away.
But don't be ashamed to cry,
It's okay.
But you've got to Hang On In,
Baby, be strong,
Love will always find a way.
No, you can't give up,
You've just got to go on,
Tomorrow's gonna be a brighter day.
Hang on.
You keep searchin' for the reasons,
As you walk the lonely halls.
You wait by a telephone,
But he never calls.
Time's the only healer
For the broken hearts (....)
Love is like a wind (...)
But you've got to Hang On In,
Baby, be strong,
Love will always find a way.
No, you can't give up,
You've just got to go on,
Tomorrow's gonna be a brighter day.
Hang on.
I know what you're goin' through,
Every time you see his face.
And I don't know where or when,
But I know that you'll love again.
Hang On In,
Baby, be strong,
Love will always find a way.
No, you can't give up,
You've just got to go on,
Tomorrow's gonna be a brighter day.
Hang on Spin that wheel
Just let go
Where she falls
Nobody knows
Save your breath
Let those snake eye roll We bounce between the devil and the deep blue sea
We bounce between forever and what may never be
Let the light of love keep bouncing off the diamond in the darker side of me I never had no education
Just an articulation of the heart
But burning deep inside me there is a diamond in the dark Catch that flame
Let it warm your soul
Love's cruel game
Is the great unknown
All that fear
Do you know you're not alone We bounce between the devil and the deep blue sea
We bounce between forever and what may never be
We bounce between decisions, destinations constantly
Let the light of love keep bouncing off the diamond in the darker side of me I never had no education
Just on inarticulation of the heart
But burning deep inside me there is a diamond in the dark A shine, a flash and then it's over
A lightning strike, a chance remark
Am I the only one here like a diamond in the dark
Like a diamond in the dark. "If they ever drop the bomb," you said
"I'll find you in the flames"
But now we act like people
Who don't know each other's names Well, sometimes it makes me sad, you know
Sometimes it makes me smile
'Cause you know how the game goes, honey
We all eat it once in awhile Scissors cut, paper covers rock
Breaks the shining scissor
You hurt me, I hurt her
And she goes and he will miss her Now I look around at people
Playing children's games
And I wonder if you're still thinking
You might find me somewhere in the flames Scissors cut, paper covers rock
Breaks the shining scissor
You hurt me, I hurt her
And she goes and we will miss her Scissors cut, paper covers rock
Breaks the shining scissor
You hurt me, I hurt her
And she, she goes and he will miss her Scissors cut, paper covers rock
Breaks the shining scissor
You hurt me, I hurt her
And she goes and he will miss her Scissors cut, paper covers rock
Breaks the shining scissor Keeping my eyes on the road I see you,
Keeping my hands on the wheel I hold you,
Ninety-nine miles from L.A.
I kiss you, I miss you,
Please be there. Passing a white sandy beach we're sailing,
Turning the radio on we're dancing,
Ninety-nine miles from L.A.
I want you, I need you,
Please be there. The windshield is covered with rain, I'm crying,
Pressing my foot on the gas, I'm flying.
Counting the telephone poles, I phone you,
Reading the signs on the road, I write you,
Ninety-nine miles from L.A. we're laughing, we're loving,
Please be there.
We're laughing, we're loving,
Please be there. I'll never let you see
The way my broken heart is hurting me
I've got my pride and I know how to hide
All my sorrow and pain
I'll do my crying in the rain If I wait for cloudy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you so
Though the heartaches remain
I'll do my crying in the rain Raindrops falling from heaven
Could never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I'll wait for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see Someday when my crying's done
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool
But till then, darling, you'll never see me complain
I'll do my craing in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain O Come All Ye Faithful
Joyful and triumphant,
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem.
Come and behold Him,
Born the King of Angels,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord. All My Love's Laughter
All my love's faces
She comes in the morning
Her cloak in her arms
She's following after
The King of all Places
And your tenderest warnin'
Could bruise all her charm But don't lose your heart
To that beautiful sinner
Who walks without shining a light
She stands in the shade
And the sun is there in her
But you'll never know til it's night All my love's softness,
All my love's graces
She carries all things
In her tiny white glove
She hides all her lostness
In satins and laces
And everyone says
She's searching for sweet love But don't try to hold on
To Satan's proud lady
Who stands with her flock
all alone on the hill
Her stockings are hung
And her eyes are so shady
She's winning, and you never will. I 'm tired of tracing vapor trail, ghost letters in the sky
Living life in daydreams, watching precious time get by Circle around this great big world, just chasing smoke, and never
touching ground Like a skywriter, rebel without a cause, drifting without an aim But I can't seem to give up this flying game
I'm a wing walker, working without a net
That's all I've ever been
And I wonder if I'm ever coming down again Some people say I'm losing touch with harsh reality
Because I can't accept the way it is with you and me
Stop living in the past, like some old pilot from a war that
wouldn't end Like a barnstormer, safe with my heart and wings
How could I ever fall
So serenely do I glide above it all I'm a skywriter, I can't forget you yet
For whatever that it's worth And sometimes I think I'm never coming back Skywriter - I can't forget you yet
For whatever that it's worth And sometimes I think I'm never coming back to earth. (Alan Jay Lerner/Frederick Loewe) I've grown accustomed to her face,
She almost makes the day begin
I've grown accustomed to the tune
She whistles night an' noon Her smiles, her frowns,
Her ups, her downs
Are second nature to me now
Like breathing out and breathing in I was serenely independent
And content, before we met
Surely I could always be that way again, and yet,
I've grown accustomed to her looks
Accustomed to her voice
Accustomed to her face! What a dream I had
Pressed in organdy
Clothed in crinoline
Of smoky burgundy
Softer than the rain I wandered empty streets down
Past the shop displays
I heard cathedral bells
Dripping down the alleyways
As I walked on And when you ran to me, your
Cheeks flushed with the night
We walked on frosted fields
Of juniper and lamplight
I held your hand And when I awoke
And felt you warm and near
I kissed your honey hair
With my grateful tears
Oh, I love you girl
Oh, I love you When you're weary
Feeling small
When tears are in your eyes
I'll dry them all
I'm on your side
Oh, when times get rough
And friends just can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I'll comfort you
I'll take your part
Oh, when darkness comes
And pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubles water
I will lay me down Sail on, silver girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All of your dreams are on their way
See how they shine
Oh, if you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind So long, Frank Lloyd Wright
I can't believe your song is gone so soon
I barely learned the tune
So soon
So soon I'll remember Frank Lloyd Wright
All of the nights we'd harmonize till dawn
I never laughed so long
So long
So long Architects may come and
Architects may go and
Never change your point of view
When I run dry
I stop a while and think of you Architects may come and
Architects may go and
Never change your point of view So long, Frank Lloyd Wright
All of the nights we'd harmonize till dawn
I never laughed so long
So long
So long Here we are, out of cigarettes
Holding hands and yawning
Look how late it gets.
Two Sleepy People
By dawn's early light,
And too much in love
To say, 'Good night.' Here we are, in the cozy chair
Pickin' on a wishbone
From the Frigidaire,
Two Sleepy People
With nothing to say,
And too much in love to break away. Do you remember
The nights we used to linger in the hall?
Your father didn't like me at all.
Do you remember
The reason why we married in the fall?
To rent this little nest
And get a bit of rest, well. Here we are
Just about the same
Foggy little fella,
Drowsy little dame.

can't keep his mind on nothin' else,
he'd trade the world for the good thing he's found.
if she is bad, he can't see it,
she can do no wrong.
turn his back on his best friend
if he put her down.
when a man loves a woman,
spend his very last dime, tryin' to hold on to what he needs.
he'd give up all his comforts,
sleep out in the rain, if she said it ought to be.
when a man loves a woman,
deep down in his soul, she can bring him such misery.
if she is playing him for the fool,
he'd be the last one to know,
lovin' eyes can never see.
when a man loves a woman,
i know exactly how he feels. Young and free, young and free
How I feel in your company
If only yesterday
I'd hesitate to say
What would become of me Young and free, young and free
Know too much, know too much
Keeps you old and gray
And out of touch
My words, too quick to sound
The arms are slow to fold around
A knowing touch
Young and free, young and free The clock alarms, the day begins
The lady charms, the money spends
She's trying on, the satin shoes
She wants to fly to Baton Rouge Ah, the clock alarms, the day begins
The lady charms, the money spends
She wants to buy, the satin shoes
She wants to fly to Baton Rouge Autumn day, autumn day
Leaves like birds
Up and flown away
Here's to days I used to wake up dead
Alone, stay in bed
The curtains drawn all day
Young and free, young and free
Young and free, young and free. Far away when the day is raining,
Far away when the sky is blue,
Anytime at all,
Take Me Away from it all.
Take Me Away. Long ago, where the Western breezes
Used to blow here into my heart,
I would hear you call,
Take Me Away from it all.
Take Me Away. (Take Me Away.)
Take Me Away from it all.
Take Me Away. (Love is like a melody we simply can't forget,
A sad and happy memory we never shall regret,
The magical duet.)
Far away when the day is sleeping,
Far away where a starry sky waits for you to call,
Take Me Away from it all.
Take Me Away. (Take Me Away.)
Take Me Away from it all.
Take Me Away. (Take Me Away.) Wake up, my love, beneath the midday sun,
Alone, once more alone,
This travelin' boy was only passing through,
But he will always think of you. One night of love beside a strange young smile,
As warm as I have known,
A travelin' boy and only passing through,
But one who'll always think of you. Take my place out on the road again,
I must do what I must do,
Yes, I know we were lovers but a drifter discovers A travelin' boy and only passing through,
But one who'll always think of you. Take my place out on the road again,
I must do what I must do,
Yes, I know we were lovers but a drifter discovers
That a perfect love won't always last forever. I won't say that I'll be back again
'Cause time alone will tell,
So no good-byes for one just passing through,
But one who'll always think of you.
No good-byes The sun goes down and says goodnight
Pull your covers up real tight
By your bed we'll leave a light
To guide you off to dreamland Your pillow's soft, your bed is warm
Your eyes are tired when day is done
One more kiss and you'll be gone
On your way to dreamland Every sleepy boy and girl
In every bed around the world
Can hear the stars up in the sky
Whispering a lullaby Who knows where you'll fly away 
Winging past the light of day
The Man-in-the-Moon and the
Milky Way
Welcome you to dreamland Every sleepy boy and girl
In every bed around the world
Can hear the stars up in the sky
Whispering a lullaby Who knows where you'll fly away
Winging past the light of day
The Man-in-the-Moon and the
Milky Way
Welcome you to dreamland I hear the drizzle of the rain
Like a memory it falls
Soft and warm continuing
Tapping on my roof and walls. And from the shelter of my mind
Through the window of my eyes
I gaze beyond the rain-drenched streets
To England where my heart lies. My mind's distracted and diffused
My thoughts are many miles away
They lie with you when you're asleep
And kiss you when you start your day. And as a song I was writing is left undone
I don't know why I spend my time
Writing songs I can't believe
With words that tear and strain to rhyme. And so you see I have come to doubt
All that I once held as true
I stand alone without beliefs
The only truth I know is you. And as I watch the drops of rain
Weave their weary paths and die
I know that I am like the rain
There but for the grace of you go I. At the corner of 53rd and the summer of '62
The first time I felt the tug of what I call the thread of you There at the Lever House
Street map across our thighs tracing the gateway
Leaning in close I'm feeling your fingertip This time, this place
This state of grace
The promise of tomorrow
Your thread runs through
Park Avenue
Street of dreams and sorrow Seven years up the road and two blocks south
On the run from a sudden rain with too much to talk about
On our knees we choose to end in St. Bartholomew's This time, this place
This state of grace
The promise of tomorrow
Your thread runs through
Park Avenue
Street of dreams and sorrow This town is my every day but sometimes the grand design
Marries a common road to an uncommon time By the Waldorf Astoria at 49th and now
Out of the uptown flood
Your face appears somehow in a passing car
Wearing a tiny scar This time, this place
This state of grace
The promise of tomorrow
Your thread runs through
Park Avenue
Street of dreams and sorrow Some enchanted evening You may see a stranger You may see a stranger across a crowded room And somehow you know You know even then That someday you'll see her again and again Some enchanted evening Someone may be laughing You may hear her laughing across a crowded room And night after night As strange as it seems The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams Who can explain it who can tell you why Fools give reasons, wise men never try Some enchanted evening When you find your true love When you feel her call you across a crowded room Then run to her side And make her your own Or all through your life you may dream all alone Once you have found her never let her go Once you have found her never let her go April come she will
When streams are ripe and swelled with rain;
May, she will stay,
Resting in my arms again June, shell change her tune,
In restless walks shell prowl the night;
July, she will fly
And give no warning to her flight. August, die she must,
The autumn winds blow chilly and cold;
September Ill remember.
A love once new has now grown old. Released on Still Crazy After All These Years (Paul Simon) and Breakaway (Art Garfunkel) In my little town, I grew up believing
God keeps His eye on us all
And He used to lean upon me
As I pledged allegiance to the wall
Lord I recall
My little town Coming home after school
Flying my bike past the gates of the factories
My mom doing the laundry,
Hanging our shirts in the dirty breeze And after it rains, there's a rainbow
And all of the colors are black
It's not that the colors aren't there
It's just imagination they lack
Everything's the same back
In my little town Nothing but the dead and dying
Back in my little town
Nothing but the dead and dying
Back in my little town In my little town, I never meant nothin'
I was just my father's son
Saving my money, dreaming of glory
Twitching like a finger on the trigger of a gun Leaving nothing but the dead and dying
Back in my little town
Nothing but the dead and dying
Back in my little town Nothing but the dead and dying
Back in my little town
Nothing but the dead and dying
Back in my little town
Nothing but the dead and dying
Back in my little town Hello, darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a streetlamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence "Fools," said I, "You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you"
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sounds of silence" (Adam Mitchell) Well there won't be no stars
Coming out in the sky
Tonight when my baby walks by
Oh they know that they can't hold a
Candle to the look in her eye Now I know that I'm not
The wisest of men
I guess mines the look of a fool
But somewhere inside I feel everything
Looking at you Quand je vois ton visage,
dans n'importe quel langage
La, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Je dis je t'aime, je dis je t'aime, je t'aime, Marie When the old people look out their window
I know they'll be happy to see
By the look in our eyes
True love hasn't died in Paris Quand je vois ton visage,
dans n'importe quel langage
La, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da Quand je vois ton visage,
dans n'importe quel langage
La, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da (Repeats) The answer took some searching for
But you think you understand With the lights still off
Our clothes still on the floor
And your head in your hands You say she's holding you back
And bringing you down
You're all out of reasons to stick around
It's time to think of yourself
In spite of her tears
And break your vow of so many years Well don't get me wrong
I like what I hear
And even if it's true
I have to ask
'Cause I wanna be absolutely clear
Just what am I to you Oh I'm your light in the dark
Your breath of fresh air
The love of your life
The answer to all your prayers No, I am just your long way home
I know it, you'll know it soon
I am just your long way home
You're welcome That morning the day had finally come
For somebody to lose
You kissed me hard and walked out of my door
To give her the bad news But I followed you there
Like the sick fuck I am
To see what she'd do when you said goodbye again She opened the door
She opened her arms And you fell into them like a baby
And there from my car
I became your long way home
I knew it, you know it now
I was just your long way home
I knew it, she knows it now
I was just your long way home You're welcome (Jimmy Webb) Went to school In Cars, in our cars, pretty girls,
Cruisin' after the game, watchin' radio.
Let your baby know In Cars, restaurant mobile,
Two behind the wheel like double-neck guitars,
In our cars.
We fell in love In Cars, in a car at the show,
Silhouettes on the glass, memories in chrome.
Take your baby home In Cars, everything was warm,
What a perfect form underneath the stars,
In our cars...
(I remember you, everything was new.
Talking in the dark, everything was true.)
If you go when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Please see she has a coat so warm
To keep her from the howling winds.
If you're travelin' in the North Country fair
Where the winds get heavy on the border line,
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine It's The Same Old Tears On A New Background,
Seeing you as a fading photograph
It hurts too much to laugh these days.
I'm all right, yes, I'm all right, all right.
It's the same old song with a new melody,
But this old candle's lingering flame is almost gone,
To see you again is all that keeps me hangin' on.
I'm all right, yes, I'm all right, all right.
Remembering, remembering the familiar heartache,
No one but you
It's the same old me crying the same old tears
And I walk away like I always do
Still in love with you.
But I'm all right, yes, I'm all right, all right.
All right (The song is repeated twice. It's
the album track played twice in a row with a string and flute interlude
between the two.)
Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine
Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
(On the side of a hill
in the deep forest green)
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
(Tracing a sparrow on
snow-crested ground)
Without no seams nor needlework
(Blankets and bedclothes
the child of the mountain)
Then she'll be a true love of mine
(Sleeps unaware of the
clarion call)
Tell her to find me an acre of land
(On the side of a hill,
a sprinkling of leaves)
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
(Washes the ground with
so many tears)
Between the salt water and the sea
strand
(A soldier cleans and
polishes a gun)
Then she'll be a true love of mine
Tell her to reap it in a sickle of
leather
(War bellows, blazing
in scarlet battalions)
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
(Generals order their
soldiers to kill)
And to gather it all in a bunch of
heather
(And to fight for a
cause they've long ago forgotten)
Then she'll be a true love of mine
Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme

Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine I've been so unlucky, I'm no good at playing games,
I remember their faces, forget their names.
Thought I'd found the right one, but she hasn't found me,
so I bundle up my emotions and start looking for the right one.
But will the right one ever come along?
Oh, I'm looking for the right one, when will the right one come along? They say there's no use running after something you'll never get,
but my heart says, "Don't say no."
Somewhere in this lonesome city is the woman for me, 
but would I wait another lifetime just to keep on looking for the right one?
But will the right one ever come along?
Oh, I'm looking for the right one, when will the right one come along? They say love always comes and goes, well, that I already know. Yes, I really know.
Looking for the right one but will the right one ever come along?
Looking for the right one but will the right one ever come along?

How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
Leading you down into my core, where I've become so numb
Without a soul, my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home (Wake me up)
Wake me up inside (I can't wake up)
Wake me up inside (save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark (Wake me up)
Bid my blood to run (I can't wake up)
Before I come undone (save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real
Bring me to life (Wake me up)
Wake me up inside (I can't wake up)
Wake me up inside (save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark (Wake me up)
Bid my blood to run (I can't wake up)
Before I come undone (save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become Bring me to life
(I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside)
Bring me to life Frozen inside without your touch, without your love
Darling, only you are the life among the dead All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years, it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here (there must be something more)
Bring me to life (Wake me up)
Wake me up inside (I can't wake up)
Wake me up inside (save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark (Wake me up)
Bid my blood to run (I can't wake up)
Before I come undone (save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become Bring me to life
(I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside)
Bring me to life I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
Your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time can not erase When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me You used to captivate me by your resonating light
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time can not erase
When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me
I've been alone all along
When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
Me...
Me... How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
Leading you down into my core, where I've become so numb
Without a soul, my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home (Wake me up)
Wake me up inside (I can't wake up)
Wake me up inside (save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark (Wake me up)
Bid my blood to run (I can't wake up)
Before I come undone (save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real
Bring me to life (Wake me up)
Wake me up inside (I can't wake up)
Wake me up inside (save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark (Wake me up)
Bid my blood to run (I can't wake up)
Before I come undone (save me)

Before I come undone (save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become Bring me to life
(I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside)
Bring me to life The words have been drained from this pencil,
Sweet words that I want to give you,
And I can't sleep, I need to tell you goodnight! When we're together I feel perfect
When I'm pulled away from you I fall apart
All that you say is sacred to me
Your eyes are so blue, I can't look away
As we lay in the stillness
You whisper to me, amy marry me,
Promise you'll stay with me.
Oh you don't have to ask me, you know you're all that I live for
You know I die just to hold you, stay with you
Somehow I'll show you, that you're my night sky
I've always been right behind you
Now I'll always be right beside you So many nights, i've cried myself to sleep
Now that you love me I love myself
I never thought I would say this
I never thought there'd be you How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
Leading you down into my core, where I've become so numb
Without a soul, my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home (Wake me up)
Wake me up inside (I can't wake up)
Wake me up inside (save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark (Wake me up)
Bid my blood to run (I can't wake up)

Sweet words that I want to give you,
And I can't sleep, I need to tell you goodnight! When we're together I feel perfect

All that you say is sacred to me
Your eyes are so blue, I can't look away
As we lay in the stillness
You whisper to me, amy marry me,
Promise you'll stay with me.
Oh you don't have to ask me, you know you're all that I live for
You know I die just to hold you, stay with you
Somehow I'll show you, that you're my night sky
I've always been right behind you
Now I'll always be right beside you So many nights, i've cried myself to sleep
Now that you love me I love myself
I never thought I would say this
I never thought there'd be you Can you forgive me again
I don't know what I said
But I didn't mean to hurt you I heard the words come out
I felt that I would die
It hurts so much to hurt you Then you look at me
You're not shouting anymore
You're silently broken I'd give anything now
To kill those words for you
Each time I say something I regret
I cry I don't want to lose you
But somehow I know that you will never leave me, yeah! 'Cause you were made for me
Somehow I'll make you see
How happy you make me, Oh! I can't live this life
Without you by my side
I need you to survive
So stay with me
You look in my eyes
And I'm screaming inside that I'm sorry
And you forgive me again
You're my one true friend
And I never meant to hurt you Lithium, don't wanna lock me up inside
Lithium, don't wanna forget how it feels without
Lithium, I wanna stay in love with my sorrow
Oh, but God I wanna let it go Come to bed, don't make me sleep alone
Couldn't hide the emptiness, you let it show
Never wanted it to be so cold
Just didn't drink enough to say you love me I can't hold on to me
Wonder what's wrong with me? Lithium, don't wanna lock me up inside
Lithium, don't wanna forget how it feels without
Lithium, I wanna stay in love with my sorrow I.
Don't wanna let it lay me down this time
Drown my will to fly
Here in the darkness I know myself Can't break free until I let it go, let me go
Darling, I forgive you after all
Anything is better than to be alone
And in the end I guess I had to fall Always find my place among the ashes
I can't hold on to me
Wonder what's wrong with me?
Lithium, don't wanna lock me up inside
Lithium, don't wanna forget how it feels without
Lithium, stay in love with you
Oh, I'm gonna let it go Now I will tell you what I've done for you
Fifty-thousand tears I've cried
Screaming, deceiving and bleeding for you
And you still won't hear me
I'm going under Don't want your hand this time I'll save myself
Maybe I'll wake up for once
Not tormented daily defeated by you
Just when I thought I'd reached the bottom I'm dying again
I'm going under
(going under)
Drowning in you
(drowning in you)
I'm falling forever
(falling forever)
I've got to break through
I'm going under Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies
So I don't know what's real and what's not
Always confusing the thoughts in my head
So I can't trust myself anymore I'm dying again
I'm going under
(going under)
Drowning in you
(drowning in you)
I'm falling forever
(falling forever)
I've got to break through So go on and scream
Scream at me, I'm so far away
I won't be broken again
I've got to breathe, I can't keep going under
I'm dying again
I'm going under
(going under)
Drowning in you
(drowning in you)
I'm falling forever
(falling forever)
I've got to break through
I'm going under
(going under)
Going under
(drowning in you)
I'm going under Don't cry to me.
If you loved me
You would be here with me.
You want me
Come find me.
Make up your mind. Should I let you fall?
Lose it all?
So maybe you can remember yourself.
Can't keep believing
We're only deceiving ourselves .
And I'm sick of the lie
And you're too late. Don't cry to me.
If you loved me
You would be here with me.
You want me
Come find me.
Make up your mind. Couldn't take the blame.
Sick with shame.
Must be exhausting to lose your own game.
Selfishly hated
No wonder you're jaded.
You can't play the victim this time And you're too late.
Don't cry to me.
If you loved me
You would be here with me.
You want me
Come find me. Make up your mind.
You never call me when you're sober.
You only want it cause it's over It's over.
How could I have burned paradise?
How could I - you were never mine.
So don't cry to me.
If you loved me
You would be here with me.
Don't lie to me
Just get your things.
I've made up your mind... Under your spell again
I can't say no to you
crave my heart and its bleeding in your hand
I can't say no to you Shouldn't have let you torture me so sweetly
now I can't let go of this dream
I can't breathe but I feel Good enough
I feel good enough for you Drink up sweet decadence
I can't say no to you
and I've completely lost myself and I don't mind
I can't say no to you Shouldn't have let you conquer me completely
now I can't let go of this dream
can't believe that I feel Good enough
I feel good enough
its been such a long time coming,
but I feel good and I'm still waiting for the rain to fall
pour real life down on me
cause I can't hold on to anything this good
enough
am I good enough
for you to love me too? so take care what you ask of me
cause I can't say no Ohh, ooh, ahh, ooh, ahh, ohh (Repeats)
Bound at every limb by my shackles of fear Sealed with lies through so many tears
Lost from within and pursuing the end
I fight for the chance to be lied to again You will never be strong enough
You will never be good enough
You were never conceived in love
You will not rise above They'll never see, I'll never be
I'll struggle on and
On to feed this hunger
Burning deep inside of me But through my tears breaks a blinding light
Birthing a dawn to this endless night
Arms outstretched, awaiting me
An open embrace upon a bleeding tree Rest in me and I'll comfort you
I have lived and I died for you
Abide in me and I vow to you
I will never forsake you They'll never see, I'll never be
I'll struggle on and
On to feed this hunger
Burning deep inside of me They'll never see, I'll never be
I'll struggle on and
On to feed this hunger
Burning deep inside of me Ohh, ooh, ahh, ooh, ahh, ohh (Repeats)
Rest in me and I'll comfort you
I have lived yet died for you
Abide in me and I vow to you
I will never forsake you
They'll never see, I'll never be
I'll struggle on and
On to feed this hunger
Burning deep inside of me
Ohh, ooh, ahh, ooh, ahh, ohh (Repeats) You are everything I need to see
Smile and sunlight makes sunlight to me
Laugh and come and look into me
Drips of moonlight washing over me
Can I show you what want from me Angel of mine, can I thank you
You have saved me time and time again
Angel, I must confess
It's you that always gives me strength
And I don't know where I'd be without you After all these years, one thing is true
Constant force within my heart is you
You touch me, I feel I'm moving into you
I treasure every day I spend with you
All the things I am come down to you Angel of mine
Let me thank you
You have saved me time and time again
Angel, I must confess
It's you that always gives me strength
And I don't know where I'd be without you Back in the arms of my angel
Back to the peace that I so love
Back in the arms of my angel I can finally rest
Giving you a gift that you remind me Angel of mine
Let me thank you
You have saved me time and time and time and time again
Angel, I must confess
It's you that always gives me strength
And I don't know where I'd be without you Angel of mine
Can I thank you
You have saved me time and time again
Angel, I must confess
It's you that always gives me strength
And I don't know where I'd be without you
...without you I will wander until the end of time
Torn away from you I pulled away to face the pain
I close my eyes and drift away
Over the fear
That I will never find a way
to heal my soul
And I will wander until the end of time
Torn away from you My heart is broken
Sweet sleep my dark angel
Deliver us from sorrow's hold (Over my heart) I can't go on living this way
I can't go back the way I came, chained of this fear
That I will never find the way
To heal my soul
And I will wander until the end of the time
Half alive without you My heart is broken
Sweet sleep my dark angel
Deliver us Change
Open your eyes to the light
I've denied it all so long
Oh so long
Say goodbye, goodbye My heart is broken
Release me, I can't hold on
Deliver us My heart is broken
Sweet sleep my dark angel
Deliver us My heart is broken
Sweet sleep my dark angel
Deliver us from sorrow's hold Perfect by nature
Icons of self indulgence
Just what we all need
More lies about a world that
Never was and never will be
Have you no shame? Don't you see me?
You know you've got everybody fooled
Look here she comes now
Bow down and stare in wonder
Oh how we love you
No flaws when you're pretending
But now I know she Never was and never will be
You don't know how you've betrayed me
And somehow you've got everybody fooled
Without the mask
Where will you hide? Can't find yourself Lost in your lie
I know the truth now
I know who you are
And I don't love you anymore
It never was and never will be
You don't know how you've betrayed me
And somehow you've got everybody fooled
It never was and never will be
You're not real and you can't save me
And somehow now you're everybody's fool I tried to kill the pain
But only brought more (so much more)
I lay dying
And I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal
I'm dying praying bleeding and screaming
Am I too lost to be saved
Am I too lost? My God my Tourniquet
Return to me salvation
My God my Tourniquet
Return to me salvation Do you remember me
Lost for so long
Will you be on the other side
Or will you forget me
I'm dying praying bleeding and screaming
Am I too lost to be saved
Am I too lost? My God my Tourniquet
Return to me salvation
My God my Tourniquet
Return to me salvation
(Return to me salvation) I want to die My God my Tourniquet
Return to me salvation
My God my Tourniquet
Return to me salvation My wounds cry for the grave
My soul cries for deliverance
Will I be denied Christ
Tourniquet
My suicide
Return to me salvation
Return to me salvation Dear my love
Haven't you wanted to be with me
And dear my love
Haven't you long to be free
I can't keep Pretending that I don't, even know you
And At sweet night
You are my own
Take my hand
We're leaving here tonight
There's no need to tell anyone They'd only hold us down
So by the morning's light
We'll be half way to anywhere
Where love is more than just your name
I have dreamt Of a place for you and I
No one knows
Who we are there
All I want
Is to give my life only to you
I've dream so long I cannot dream anymore
Let's run away
I'll take you there
We're leaving here tonight
There's no need to tell anyone
They'd only hold us down
So by the morning's light
We'll be half way to anywhere
Where no one needs a reason
Forget this life come with me
Don't look back you're safe now
Unlock your heart drop your guard No one's left to stop you
Forget this life come with me
Don't look back you're safe now
Unlock your heart drop your guard
No one's left to stop you now
We're leaving here tonight
There's no need to tell anyone
They'd only hold us down
So by the morning's light
We'll be half way to anywhere
Where love is more than just your name Give me a reason to believe
That you're gone
I see your shadow so I know
They're all wrong Moonlight on the soft brown earth
It leads me to where you lay
They took you away from me
But now I'm taking you home I will stay forever here with you
My love
The softly spoken words you gave me
Even in death, our love goes on Some say I'm crazy for my love
Oh my love
But no bonds can hold me from your side
Oh my love They don't know you can't leave me
They don't hear you singing to me
I will stay forever here with you
My love The softly spoken words you gave me
Even in death, our love goes on
And I can't love you any more than I do
I will stay forever here with you
My love
The softly spoken words you gave me
Even in death, our love goes on
And I can't love you any more than I do
People die, but real love is forever The more you try to fight it
The more you try to hide it
The more infected, rejected, you feel alone inside it
You know you can't deny it
The world's a little more fucked up everyday I'm gonna save you from it
Together we'll outrun it
Just don't give into the fear
So many things I would've told you If I knew that I was never gonna see you again I wanna lift you up into the light that you deserve
I wanna take your pain into myself so you won't hurt Don't you dare surrender
Don't leave me here without you
Cause I could never
Replace your perfect imperfection The way you look us over
Your counterfeit composure
Pushing again and again and sinking lower and lower
The world is on our shoulders
Do you really know the weight of the words you say? You want a little of it
You just can't let go of it
You've got an ego to feed
Too late to rise above it
Don't look now but the little girl's got a grenade I'm gonna lift you up into the light you deserve
I'm gonna take you down to the real world so you can watch it burn Don't you dare surrender
Don't leave me here without you
Cause I would never
Replace your perfect imperfection We stand undefined
Can't be drawn with a straight line
This will not be our ending
We are alive, we are alive Don't you dare surrender
Don't leave me here without you
Cause I would never
Replace your perfect imperfection Don't you dare surrender
I'm still right beside you
And I would never
Replace your perfect imperfection All of my hate cannot be found
I will not be bound by your thoughtless scheming
No,
you can try to tear me down
Beat me to the ground,
I will see you screaming
Thumbing through the pages of my fantasies
Pushing all the mercy
down,
down,
down
Wanna see you try to take a swing at me
Come on,
gonna put you on the
ground,
ground,
ground
Why are you trying to make fun of me?
You think it's funny,
what the fuck you think it's doing to me?
You take your turn
lashing out at me
I want you crying when you're bloody down in front of me
All of my hate cannot be found
I will not be bound by your thoughtless scheming
No,
you can try to tear me down
Beat me to the ground,
I will see you screaming
Thumbing through the pages of my fantasies
I'm above you,
smiling at you
drown,
drown,
drown
Wanna kill and rape you the way you raped me
And I'll pull the trigger and you're
down,
down,
down
Why are you trying to make fun of me?
You think it's funny,
what the fuck you think it's doing to me?
You take your turn
lashing out at me
I want you crying when you're bloody down in front of me
All of my hate cannot be found
I will not be bound by your thoughtless scheming
No,
you can try to tear me down
Beat me to the ground,
I will see you screaming
All my friends are gone,
they died
They all screamed and cried
I'm gonna take you down,
gonna take you down
Gonna take you down,
gonna take you down
All of my hate cannot be found
I will not be bound by your thoughtless scheming
No,
you can try to tear me down
Beat me to the ground,
I will see you screaming
All of my hate cannot be found
I will not be bound by your thoughtless scheming
No,
you can try to tear me down
Beat me to the ground,
I will see you screaming (i'm a tuna fisher singing in the tuna afternoon)
You know you're not the only one.
When they all come crashing down, midflight.
You know you're not the only one.
When they're so alone they find a back door out of life. You know you're not the only one.
We're all grieving Lost and bleeding.
All our lives
We've been waiting
For someone to call our leader. All your lies
I'm not believing.
Heaven shine a light down on me
So afraid to open your eyes, hypnotized.
You know you're not the only one. Never understood this life and you're right, I don't deserve.
But you know I'm not the only one. We're all grieving
Lost and bleeding.
All our lives
We've been waiting For someone to call our leader.
All your lies
I'm not believing.
Heaven shine a light down on me. Don't look down
Don't look into the eyes of the world beneath you.
Don't look down, you'll fall down
You'll become their sacrifice.
Right or wrong.
Can't hold onto the fear that I'm lost without you.
If I can't feel, I'm not mine
I'm not real.
All our lives
We've been waiting
For someone to call our leader.
All your lies
I'm not believing
Heaven shine a light down on me. I sense there's something in the wind
That feels like tragedy's at hand
And though I'd like to stand by him
Can't shake this feeling that I have
The worst is just around the bend And does he notice my feelings for him?
And will he see how much he means to me?
I think it's not to be
What will become of my dear friend
Where will his actions lead us then?
Although I'd like to join the crowd
In their enthusiastic cloud
Try as I may, it doesn't last And will we ever end up together?
No, I think not, it's never to become
For I am not the one And will we ever end up together?
Ohhhhhhh And will we ever end up together?
No, I think not, it's never to become
For I am not the one Don't cry to me.
If you loved me
You would be here with me.
You want me
Come find me.
Make up your mind.
Should I let you fall?
Lose it all?
So maybe you can remember yourself.
Can't keep believing
We're only deceiving ourselves .
And I'm sick of the lie
And you're too late.
Don't cry to me.
If you loved me
You would be here with me.
You want me
Come find me.
Make up your mind.
Couldn't take the blame.
Sick with shame.
Must be exhausting to lose your own game.
Selfishly hated
No wonder you're jaded.
You can't play the victim this time
And you're too late.
Don't cry to me.
If you loved me
You would be here with me.
You want me
Come find me.
Make up your mind.
You never call me when you're sober.
You only want it cause it's over
It's over.
How could I have burned paradise?
How could I - you were never mine.
So don't cry to me.
If you loved me
You would be here with me.
Don't lie to me
Just get your things.
I've made up your mind. Listen, listen
Listen, listen
Listen, listen
Listen, listen Listen (listen), listen (listen)
Listen (listen), listen (listen)
Listen (listen), listen (listen)
Listen (listen), listen (listen) Listen to each drop of rain (listen, listen)
Whispering secrets in vain (listen, listen)
Frantically searching for someone to hear
Their story before they hit ground. Please don't let go
Can't we stay for a while
It's just too hard to say goodbye
Listen to the rain Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen to the rain
Weeping Listen (listen), listen (listen)
Listen (listen), listen (listen) I stand alone in the storm.
Suddenly sweet words take hold:
"Hurry!" they say, "for you haven't much time!
"Open your eyes to the love around you;
"you may feel you're alone,
"but I'm here still with you.
"You can do what you dream,
"just remember to
"Listen to the Rain." Listen I can't see your star
I can't see your star
Though I patiently waited bedside for the death of today
I can't see your star
The mechanical lights of Lisbon frightened it away
And I'm alone now
Me and all I stood for
we're wandering now
All in parts and pieces swim lonely
Find your own way out
I can't see your star I can't see your star
How can the darkness feel so wrong?
And I'm alone now
Me and all I stood for
we're wandering now All in parts and pieces
swim lonely
Find your own way out
So far away
It's growing colder without your love
Why can't you feel me calling your name? Can't break the silence
it's breaking me
All my fears
turn to rage
And I'm alone now
Me and all I stood for
we're wandering now
All in parts and pieces
swim lonely
Find your own way out now
Hey, nothing worth fighting for
We're wandering now
All in parts and pieces
swim lonely
Find your own way out I've spent so much time
Throwing rocks at your window
That I never even knocked
On your front door I walk by statues
Never even made one chip
But if I could leave a mark
On the monument of the heart
I just might lay myself down
For a little more than I had The last day
The last day
The last day Wait a time
To spare these lies we tell ourselves
These days have come and gone
But this time is sweeter than honey I wanted you to know that
I love the way you laugh
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away...
I keep your photograph and
I know it serves me well
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone away You gone away, you don't feel me here anymore The worst is over now
And we can breathe again
I wanna hold you high, you steal my pain away
There's so much left to learn
And no one left to fight
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain Cause I'm broken when I'm open
And I don't feel like I am strong enough
Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone away
Cause I'm broken when I'm open
And I don't feel like I am strong enough
Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone away... Everything is so dark
And I know there's something wrong
But I can't turn the light on
In that split second change
When you knew we couldn't hold on
I realized I lived to love you Save yourself
Don't look back
Tearing us apart until it's all gone
The only world I've ever known
sleeps beneath the waves
But I remember I won't give up on you
I can feel you in my heart,
just show me the way
I don't belong here, alone
I can still see your face
Where it's burned into my mind
I die every time
I close my eyes, you're always there Save yourself
Don't look back
Tearing us apart until it's all gone
The only world I've ever known
sleeps beneath the waves
But I'm the one who's drowning
Without your love
I am lost and I can never go back home All across the ocean
We are calling, calling
Are you there?
Nothing left for me till I find you Because it's All gone
The only world I've ever known sleeps beneath the waves
But I'm the one who's drowning
Without your love
I am lost and I can never go back
I can never go back home Feels like the weight of the world,
Like God in heaven gave me a turn.
Don't cling to me, I swear I can't fix you.
Still in the dark, can you fix me? Freefall, freefall, all through life. If you love me, then let go of me.
I won't be held down by who I used to be.
She's nothing to me. Feels like the weight of the world,
Like all my screaming has gone unheard.
And oh, I know you don't believe in me.
Safe in the dark, how can you see? Freefall, freefall, all through life. If you love me, then let go of me.
I won't be held down by who I used to be. If you love me, then let go of me
I won't be held down by who I was If you love me, then let go of me
I won't be held down by who I used to be You don't remember me but I remember you
I lie awake and try so hard not to think of you
But who can decide what they dream?
And dream I do I believe in you
I'll give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you
To live, to breathe
You're taking over me Have you forgotten all I know
And all we had?
You saw me mourning my love for you
And touched my hand
I knew you loved me then I believe in you
I'll give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you
To live, to breathe
You're taking over me I look in the mirror and see your face
If I look deep enough
So many things inside that just like you are taking over I believe in you
I'll give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you
To live, to breathe
You're taking over me I believe in you
I'll give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you
To live, to breathe
You're taking over me (taking over me)
You're taking over me (taking over me)
Taking over me Walkin around 24/7,
waiting for you to arise,
from your deadly grave,
firey flames blowing in my face,
burning through my skin,
but how can I help it,
forgive me god for I have sinned. Forgive me God,
Forgive me god,
For I have sinned,
Im all wound up in flames
who wants to be an angel,
I'm hells angel,
Hells Angel. Throwing flames up above,
killing what I don't shove
I don't have time to be what I really am,
knowing it all,
catching nothing,
nobody cares about me,
well nobody really knows me I'm hells angel,
rising down below,
hating what I don't have,
forgive me God,
forgive me,
for I have sinned. Walkin around 24/7,
waiting for you to arise,
from your deadly grave,
firey flames blowing in my face,
burning through my skin,
but how can I help it,
It's not me, it's my inner soul. Forgive me,
Forgive me,
hell raising angel,
hell risin angel,
I'm hells angel,
hells angel,
hells angel I still remember the world
From the eyes of a child
Slowly those feelings
Were clouded by what I know now Where has my heart gone
An uneven trade for the real world
Oh I, I want to go back to
Believing in everything and knowing nothing at all I still remember the sun
Always warm on my back
Somehow it seems colder now Where has my heart gone
Trapped in the eyes of a stranger
Oh I, I want to go back to
Believing in everything (Latin hymn) Iesu, Rex admirabilis
et triumphator nobilis,
dulcedo ineffabilis, totus desiderabilis. (Man:)
As the years pass by
Before my face
As wars rage before me
Finding myself
In these last days of existence
This parasite inside me
I forced it out.
In the darkness of the storm Lies an evil
But it's me.
Where has my heart gone
An uneven trade for the real world
Oh I, I want to go back to
Believing in everything
Oh where, where has my heart gone
Trapped in the eyes of a stranger
Oh I, I want to go back to
Believing in everything Speak your mind,
Like I care
I can see your lips moving
I just learned not to hear
Don't waste your time It's never enough for you, baby
Don't want to play your game anymore
No matter what you say
I'm all out of love for you, baby
Now that I've tried everything
I'll numb the pain,
'till I am made of stone Take your time
I'm not scared
Make me everything you need me to be
So the judgment seems fair
Don't waste your time It's never enough for you, baby
Don't wanna play your game anymore
No matter what you say
I'm all out of love for you, baby
Now that I have tried everything
I'll numb the pain
'till I am made... Tear out my heart
For the way that it feels
I will still remember
When you've long forgotten me It's never enough for you, baby
Don't wanna play your game anymore
No matter what you say
I'm all out of love for you, baby
Now that I've tried everything
I'll numb the pain
'till I am made of stone It's never enough
It's never enough
It's never enough
I'll numb the pain
'till I am made of stone
I'll numb the pain
'till I am made of stone Seems so far
That i have gone down this road
Only to find that it ends
But lookin' back
There is one thing that I know
I can't make it all alone again 'Cause im too weak to stand on my own
But all I need is you [Chorus]
So lead me
Guide me
Hold me
Hide me in love
With all that you are
and all that you do Hear me
Take me
Mold me
Break me, oh God
Just fill all of me
As i fall Into you Just catch me as I fall
But all this time
I have felt so alone
losing myself in my despair
With loving arms
You were waiting for me to let go
With every step
you were there 'Cause I'm too weak to stand on my own
When all i need is you (chorus) Oh my child
How i have longed
For you to come home
to where you belong
All of your life
If you could just see
All of my joy
When you are here with me (X2) Hear me Take me
mold me
break me, oh god
Just fill all of me
as I fall into you Make me whole again
Open your eyes
Taunted by the shadows
Of your lie
Cold and far away
But not even mine
Undo everything
And take me Higher
Never believing what they say
Cause I'm Counting the days
To meet you on the other side
I will always be
Waiting
Until the day that I see you
On the other side
Come and take me home I'm not giving in
I want you back
Holding together by the shards of our past
Stole my heart away
I can't let you go
Break these chains
And let me fly to you High above the world below
Over and over in my mind Counting the days
To meet you on the other side
I will always be
Waiting
Until the day that I see you
On the other side
Come and take me home... I am so lost without my place
Inside your heart
I won't survive
I need to know you hear me
Awaken and released, my love Counting the days
To meet you on the other side
I will always be...
Waiting
Until the day
That I see you on the other side
Come and take me Counting the days
To meet you on the other side
I will always be
Waiting
Until the day that I see you
On the other side
Come and take me home I found a grave
Brushed off the face
Felt your light
and I remember why I know this place I found a bird
Closing her eyes
One last time
And I wonder if she dreamed like me Well, as much as it hurts
Ain't it wonderful to feel?
So go on and break your wings
Follow your heart
Till it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream I'm not afraid
I push through the pain
And I'm on fire
I remember how to breathe again As much as it hurts
Ain't it wonderful to feel? So go on and break your wings
Follow your heart
Till it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream Why must we fall apart to understand how to fly?
I will find a way
Even without wings
Follow your heart
Till it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream
Follow your heart
Till it bleeds
And we've gone to the end of the dream Do what you, what you want
If you have a dream for better (It isn't over)
Do what you, what you want
Till you don't want it anymore (remember who you really are) Do what you, what you want
Your world's closing in on you now (it isn't over)
Stand and face the unknown
(Got to remember who you really are) Every heart
In my hands
Like a pale reflection Hello, hello, remember me?
I'm everything you can't control
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be a way to believe
We can break through Do what you, what you want
You don't have to lay your life down (it isn't over)
Do what you, what you want
Till you find what you're looking for
(Got to remember who you really are) But every hour slipping by
Screams that I have failed you Hello, hello, remember me?
I'm everything you can't control
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be a way to believe... Hello, hello, remember me?
I'm everything you can't control
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be a way to believe... There's still time
Close your eyes
Only love will guide you home
Tear down the walls and free your soul
Till we crash, we're forever spiraling
Down, down, down, down Hello, hello, it's only me
Infecting everything you love
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be a way to believe... Hello, hello, remember me?
I'm everything you can't control
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be a way to learn forgiveness Hello, hello, remember me?
I'm everything you can't control
Somewhere beyond the pain
There must be a way to believe
We can break through (Remember who you really are)
Do what you, what you want Turn out the lights
Feed the fire till my soul breathes free
My heart is high as the waves above me
Don't need to understand
Too lost to lose
Don't fight my tears, cuz they feel so good
And I, I will remember how to fly
Unlock the heavens in my mind
Follow my love back through the same secret door Look past the end
It's a dream, as it's always been
All life lives on if we've ever loved it And I, I will remember how to fly
Unlock the heavens in my mind
Follow my love back through the same secret door  And I, I will remember how to fly
Unlock the heavens in my mind
Follow my love back through the same secret door  Away From You Sadie, the queen of disaster
I can't believe I fell for you
Lady, you tourbillon laughter
Makes me fade away Lady, the wounds could heal but
Baby, when I'm living without you
Life's alright, I'm tired of your game
The more you lie the more I hope
You're gone forever, I feel alright
Cause we're through Away from you, I will be fine
and I'll leave it all behind
Away from you, I never
look back
Everyone knows you're a maniac
Away from you, Theres no way turning back Sadie, the queen of disaster
I can't believe I fell for you
Lady, you tourbillon laughter
Makes me fade away Lady, the wounds could heal but
Baby, when I'm living without you
Life's alright, I'm tired of your game
The more you lie the more I hope
You're gone forever, I feel alright
Cause we're through Away from you, I will be fine
and I'll leave it all behind
Away from you, I never
look back
Everyone knows you're a maniac
Away from you, Theres no way turning back Woah, woah, woah, woah Out on your own
Cold and alone again
Can this be what you really wanted, baby? Blame it on me
Set your guilt free
Nothing can hold you back now Now that you're gone
Feel like myself again
Grieving the things I can't repair and willing To let you blame it on me
And set your guilt free
I don't want to hold you back now, love I can't change who I am Not this time
I won't lie to keep you near me
And in this short life
There's no time to waste on giving up
My love wasn't enough And you can blame it on me
Just set your guilt free, honey
I don't want to hold you back now, love Perfect by nature
Icons of self indulgence
Just what we all need
More lies about a world that Never was and never will be
Have you no shame? Don't you see me?
You know you've got everybody fooled Look here she comes now
Bow down and stare in wonder
Oh how we love you
No flaws when you're pretending
But now I know she Never was and never will be
You don't know how you betrayed me
And somehow you've got everybody fooled Without the mask
Where will you hide
Can't find yourself
Lost in your lies I know the truth and now
I know who you are
And I don't love you anymore It never was and never will be
You don't know how you betrayed me
And somehow you've got everybody fooled Never was and never will be
You're not real and you can't save me
Somehow now you're everybody's fool. 
 Every time we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that I get
But I haven't missed you yet Every roommate kept awake
By every sigh and scream we make
All the feelings that I get
But I still don't miss you yet Only when I stop to think about it I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you? Every time we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that I get
But I haven't missed you yet Only when I stop to think about it I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you? Only when I stop to think about you
I know
Only when you stop to think about me
Do you know? I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
You hate everything about me
Why do you love me? I hate
You hate
I hate
You love me I hate everything about you
Why do I love you? You're too important for anyone
You play the role of all you long to be
But I, I know who you really are
You're the one who cries when you're alone But where will you go
With no one left to save you from yourself
You can't escape
You can't escape You think that I can't see right through your eyes
Scared to death to face reality
No one seems to hear your hidden cries
You're left to face yourself alone But where will you go (where will you go)
With no one left to save you from yourself
You can't escape the truth
I realize you're afraid (I realize)
But you can't abandon everyone
You can't escape
You don't want to escape I'm so sick of speaking words that no one understands
Is it clear enough that you can't live your whole life all alone?
I can hear you in a whisper
But you can't even hear me screaming Where will you go (where will you go)
With no one left to save you from yourself
You can't escape
The truth
I realize you're afraid (I realize)
But you can't reject the whole world
You can't escape You don't want to escape I've spent so much time throwing rock at your window
that I never even knocked on the front door I walk by statues never even made one chip
but if I could leave a mark on the monument of the heart
I just might lay myself down
for a little more than
I had the last day The last day, the last day,
the last day Wait a time to spare thede lies we tell aurselves
These days have come and gone
But this time is sweeter than honey Lost whispers
Awaken within me
And fly
Lost whispers
Awaken within me
And fly
Lost whispers
Awaken within me
And flyLost whispers

And flyLost whispers
Awaken within me
And fly How many times have you told me you love her?
As many times as I've wanted to tell you the truth
How long have I stood here beside you?
I live through you You looked through me
Ooh, Solitude
Still with me is only you
Ooh, Solitude I can't stay away from you
How many times have I done this to myself?
How long will it take before I see?
When will this hole in my heart be mended? Who now is left alone but me?
Ooh, Solitude
Forever me and forever you
Ooh, Solitude Only you, only true
Everyone leaves me stranded
Forgotten, abandoned, left behind
I can't stay here another night Your secret admirer
Who could it be?
Ooh, Can't you see
All along it was me? How can you be so blind
As to see right through me?
And Ooh, Solitude
Still with me is only you
Ooh, Solitude
I can't stay away from you
Ooh, Solitude
Forever me and forever you
Ooh, Solitude
Only you, only true "You hold the answers deep within your own mind.
Consciously, you've forgotten it.
That's the way the human mind works:
whenever something is too unpleasant, to shameful for us
to entertain, we reject it.
We erase it from our memories.
But the imprint is always there." (Can't wash it all away)
(Can't Wish it all away)
(Can't hope it all away)
(Can't cry it all away) The pain that grips you
The fear that blinds you
Releases life in me
In our mutual
Shame we hide our eyes
To blind them from the truth
That finds a way from who we are
Please don't be afraid
When the darkness fades away
The dawn will break the silence
Screaming in our hearts
My love for you still grows
This I do for you
Before I try to fight the truth my final time "We're supposed to try and be real.
And I feel alone, and we're not together. And that is real." Can't wash it all away
Can't wish it all away
Can't cry it all away
Can't scratch it all away Lying beside you
Listening to you breathe
The life that flows inside of you
Burns inside of me
Hold and speak to me
Of love without a sound
Tell me you will live through this
And I will die for you
Cast me not away
Say you'll be with me
For I know I cannot
Bear it all alone "You're not alone, honey.
Never... Never." Can't fight it all away
Can't hope it all away
Can't scream it all away
It just won't fade away, no Can't wash it all away
Can't wish it all away
Can't cry it all away
Can't scratch it all away (Can't fight it all away)
(Can't hope it all away)
Can't scream it all away
Ooh, it all away
Ooh, it all away "But the imprint is always there. Nothing is ever really forgotten." "God, please don't hate me.
Because I'll die if you do.
Because I'll die if you do.
Because I'll die if you do.
Because I'll die if you do." You don't remember me but I remember you
I lie awake and try so hard not to think of you
But who can decide what they dream?
And dream I do I believe in you
I'll give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you
To live, to breathe
You're taking over me Have you forgotten all I know
And all we had?
You saw me mourning my love for you
And touched my hand
I knew you loved me then I believe in you
I'll give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you
To live, to breathe
You're taking over me I look in the mirror and see your face
If I look deep enough
So many things inside that just like you are taking over I believe in you
I'll give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you
To live, to breathe
You're taking over me I believe in you
I'll give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you
To live, to breathe
You're taking over me (taking over me)
You're taking over me (taking over me)
Taking over me I can't run anymore
I fall before you
Here I am
I have nothing left
Though I've tried to forget
You're all that I am
Take me home
I'm through fighting it Broken
Lifeless
I give up
You're my only strength
Without you
I can't go on
Anymore Ever again My only hope
(All the times I've tried)
My only peace
(To walk away from you)
My only joy
My only strength
(I fall into your abounding grace)
My only power My only life
(And love is where I am) My only love I can't run anymore
I give myself to you
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
In all my bitterness
I ignored all that's real and true
All I need is you
When night falls on me
I'll not close my eyes
I'm too alive
And you're too strong I can't lie anymore
I fall down before you
I'm sorry I'm sorry My only hope
(All the times I've tried)
My only peace
(To walk away from you)
My only joy My only strength
(I fall into your abounding grace)
My only power
My only life (And love is where I am)
My only love Constantly ignoring The pain consuming me
But this time it's cut too deep
I'll never stray again My only hope
(All the times I've tried)
My only peace
(To walk away from you)
My only joy
My only strength
(I fall into your abounding grace)
My only power
My only life
(And love is where I am)
My only love
My only hope
(All the times I've tried)
My only peace
(To walk away from you)
My only joy
My only strength
(I fall into your abounding grace)
My only power
My only life
(And love is where I am)
My only love I've been believing in something so distant
As if I was human
And I've been denying this feeling of hopelessness
In me, in me All the promises I made
Just to let you down
You believed in me, but I'm broken I have nothing left
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
We've been falling for all this time
And now I'm lost in paradise As much as I'd like the past not to exist
It still does
And as much as I'd like to feel like I belong here
I'm just as scared as you I have nothing left
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
We've been falling for all this time
And now I'm lost in paradise Run away, run away
One day we won't feel this pain anymore
Take it all the way, shadows of you
Cause they won't let me go 'Till I have nothing left
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
We've been falling for all this time
And now I'm lost in paradise Alone and lost in paradise Stoplight, lock the door
Don't look back
Undress in the dark
And hide from you, all of you You'll never know the way your words have haunted me
I can't believe you'd ask these things of me
You don't know me
no one ever You belong to me, my snow white queen
There's nowhere to run, so let's just get it over
Soon I know you'll see, you're just like me
Don't scream anymore, my love, 'cause all I want is you Wake up in a dream
Frozen fear
All your hands on me
I can't scream, I can't scream I can't escape the twisted way you think of me
I feel you in my dreams and I don't sleep
I don't sleep You belong to me, my snow white queen
There's nowhere to run, so let's just get it over
Soon I know you'll see, you're just like me
Don't scream anymore, my love, 'cause all I want is you I can't save your life
Though nothing I bleed for is more tormenting
I'm losing my mind
And you just stand there and stare as my world divides You belong to me, my snow white queen
There's nowhere to run, so let's just get it over
Soon I know you'll see, you're just like me
Don't scream anymore, my love, 'cause all I want is you
All I want is you
All I want is you
All I want is you I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here And it won't leave me alone
These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
You used to captivate me
By your resonating light
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me
These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me
I've been alone all along
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me...
All of me...
All of me...
All... Never thought that I'd be leaving you today
So alone and wondering why I feel this way
So wide the world
Can love remember how to get me home to you
Someday We'll be together again
All just a dream in the end
We'll be together again So many fears were swimming around and around in my mind
Who would have dreamed the secrets we would find I've found a world where love and dreams and darkness all collide
Maybe this time we can leave our broken world behind
We'll be together again
All just a dream in the end It's too late to change your mind
Even though this fragile world is tearing apart at the seams
I can't wash these sins away
This sinking feeling everyday:
I'm waking up in someone else's life
Is it so hard for you? Cause it's so hard for me
To believe that what we dreamed could ever come to life again
Cause I cannot erase this life
Not gonna let this day go by
I'm gonna save this wasted life And nothing can stand in my way
Not enough to say goodbye
Burn it 'til there's nothing left
I'm drowning in the mess that I have made
Is it so hard for you?
Cause it's so hard for me To believe that what we dreamed could ever come to life again
Cause I cannot erase this life
The water's rising around us
There is no other way down
I only have myself to blame for it all Is it so hard for you?
Cause it's so hard for me
To believe that what we dreamed could ever come to life again
If I could just erase my mind
But I cannot erase this life "You hold the answers deep within your own mind.
Consciously, you've forgotten it.
That's the way the human mind works.
Whenever something is too unpleasant, too shameful for us
to entertain, we reject it.
We erase it from our memories.
But the IMPRINT is always there." (Can't wash it all away)
(Can't Wish it all away)
(Can't hope it all away)
(Can't cry it all away) The pain that grips you
The fear that binds you
Releases life in me
In our mutual
Shame we idolize
To blind them from the truth 
That finds a way from who we are
Please don't be afraid
When the darkness fades away
The dawn will break the silence
Screaming in our hearts
My love for you still grows
This I do for you
Before I try to fight the truth 
my final time "We're supposed to try and be real.
And I feel alone, and we're not together. And that is real." Can't wash it all away
Can't wish it all away
Can't cry it all away
Can't scratch it all away Lying beside you
Listening to you breathe
The life that flows inside of you
Burns inside of me
Hold and speak to me
Of love without a sound
Tell me you will live through this
And I will die for you
Cast me not away
Say you'll be with me
For I know I cannot
Bear it all alone "You're not alone, are you?"
"Never... Never." Can't fight it all away
Can't hope it all away
Can't scream it all away
It just won't fade away, No Can't wash it all away
Can't wish it all away
Can't cry it all away
Can't scratch it all away (Can't fight it all away)
(Can't hope it all away)
Can't scream it all away
Ooh, it all away
Ooh, it all away "But the answer is always there. Nothing is ever really forgotten."
"Please don't hate me.
Cause I'd die if you do.
Cause I'd die if you do.
Cause I'd die if you do.
Cause I'd die if you do." It's true, we're all a little insane
But it's so clear
Now that I am unchained Fear is only in our minds
Taking over all the time
Fear is only in our minds
But it's taking over all the time You poor sweet innocent thing
Dry your eyes and testify
You know you live to break me
Don't deny, sweet sacrifice One day, I'm gonna forget your name
And one sweet day
You're gonna drown in my lost pain Fear is only in our minds
Taking over all the time
Fear is only in our minds
But it's taking over all the time You poor sweet innocent thing
Dry your eyes and testify
And oh, you love to hate me
Don't you, honey? I'm your sacrifice I dream in darkness
I sleep to die
Erase the silence
Erase my life Our burning ashes
Blacken the day
A world of nothingness
Blow me away Do you wonder why you hate?
Are you still too weak to survive your mistakes?
You poor sweet innocent thing Dry your eyes and testify
You know you live to break me
Don't deny, sweet sacrifice Hi I'm Robby's sister, I guess that's plain to see
When we watch cartoon cartoons, I'm happy as can be
I think samurai Jack is cool, And Dexter's laboratory
I miss watching power puff, I miss watching T.V. Well livin' on the tour bus ain't that bad
But I feel like I lost all that, I have On Cartoon Network, I miss you so
On Cartoon Network, where did you go
Grim and evil, how I love that little brain
Johnny Bravo, can I smack you once again? I hope you've learned a lesson here
Treasure what you have, don't make the mistake I made
The rockstar life is sad Well, livin' on the tour bus is, pretty bad
And now I'm sure I know, the meanin' of my life
The love within my soul
The reason I wake up each day, and it's: Cartoon Network, I miss you so
My Cartoon Network, where did you go
My Cartoon Network Meet me after dark again and I'll hold you
I am nothing more than to see you there
And maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
We'll be lost before the dawn If only night can hold you where I can see you, my love
Then let me never ever wake again
And maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
We'll be lost before the dawn Somehow I know that we can't wake again from this dream
It's not real, but it's ours Maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
We'll be lost before the dawn
Maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
We'll be lost before the dawn My cell's not ringing, my doorbell isn't singing
My bed is empty, I'm fragile; all I do is cry
Because he left me, and you didn't even want me
I'm lost and lonely... Can't live without you (You)
My cell's not ringing, my doorbell isn't singing
(You)
My bed is empty, I'm fragile; all I do is cry
(You)
Because he loved me, and you didn't even want me
(You)
I'm lost and lonely... Can't live without you (Chorus)
You
Every beat of my heart, every day of my life
(You)
Every thought on my mind
Every second, every moment
You
Every still of the night, every romance goes right
(You)
Every dream I deny
Every second, every moment
You
Every beat of my heart, every day of my life
(You)
Every thought on my mind
Every second, every moment
You
Every tear that I cry, every hope in my mind
(You)
Everything that I hide
Every second, every moment You (8x's) I'm hearing footsteps outside my door I get up
A voice is humming, a tune that's sounding like "goodbye"
I know I'll find you, no matter where you're hiding
And so I wish for a chance to find you You
Every beat of my heart, every day of my life
(You)
Every thought on my mind
Every second, every moment
You
Every still of the night, every romance goes right
(You)
Every dream I deny
Every second, every moment
You
Every beat of my heart, every day of my life
(You)
Every thought on my mind
Every second, every moment
You
Every tear that I cry, every hope in my mind
(You)
Everything that I hide
Every second, every moment You
Every beat of my heart, every day of my life
(You)
Every thought on my mind
Every second, every moment (12x's) You (16x's) Where's the light
Killed my day
Lost in the dark of your ways
Wasted my energy, endlessly
On your sweet lie And if you don't mind
I would like to live the lie
That I will survive
And if you don't mind
I would love to slip away
And leave your world behind Insecure, I'm not so sure that
You're not just faking something
Wasted our last day
I can't take the pain, babe And if you don't mind
I would like to live the lie
That I will survive
And If you don't mind
I would love to slip away and leave it all behind And if you don't mind
I would like to live the lie
That I will survive
And if you don't mind
If you don't mind "Bleed (I Must Be Dreaming)" How can I pretend that I don't see
What you hide so carelessly?
I saw her bleed
You heard me breathe
And I froze inside myself
And turned away
I must be dreaming We all live
We all die
That does not begin to justify you It's not what it seems
Not what you think
No, I must be dreaming
It's only in my mind
Not in real life
No, I must be dreaming Help you know I've got to tell someone
Tell them what I know you've done
I fear you but spoken fears can come true We all live
We all die
That does not begin to justify you It's not what it seems
Not what you think
No, I must be dreaming
It's only in my mind
Not in real life
No, I must be dreaming We all live and
We all die but
That does not begin to justify you It's not what it seems
Not what you think
No, I must be dreaming
It's only in my mind
Not in real life
No, I must be dreaming Not what it seems
Not what you think
I must be dreaming
Just in my mind
Not in real life
I must be dreaming Sparkling gray
They're my own veins
Any more than a whisper
Any sudden movement of my heart
And I know
I know I'll have to watch them pass away
Just get through this day Give up your way
You could be anything
Give up my way
And lose myself
Not today
There's too much guilt to pay Sickened in the sun
You dare tell me you love me
But you held me down and screamed you wanted me to die
Honey you know
You know I'd never hurt you that way
You're just so pretty in your pain Give up my way
And I could be anything
I'll make my own way
Without your senseless
Hate... hate... hate... hate So run... run... run
And hate me
If it feels good
I can't hear your screams anymore You lied to me
But I'm older now
And I'm not buying baby Demanding my response
Don't bother breaking the door down
I found my way out
And you'll never hurt me again Save your twisted enemy
So you might earn forgiveness
You know your whole world is waiting
So why can't you speak? I feel it coming over me
I'm still a slave to these dreams
Is this the end of everything?
Or just a new way to bleed? So go and tell all your friends
That I'm a failure underneath
If it makes you feel like a bigger man But it's my, my heart, my life
That you call it a lie
I've played this game before And I can't take anymore
I feel it coming over me
I'm still a slave to these dreams
Is this the end of everything? Or just a new way to bleed?
I drifted far beyond the end
Freedom, freedom,
Can't you feel the ground caving in?
Freedom,
Give us a reason to believe again
I feel it coming over me
I'm still a slave to these dreams
Is this the end of everything?
Or just a new way to bleed? Nobody on the road
Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm drivin' by your house
Though I know you're not at home But I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy?
Remember how I made you scream
Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But babe, I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
I see you walkin' real slow and you're smilin' at everyone
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone Out on the road today, I saw a BLACK FLAG sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice Inside my head said, "Don't look back. You cannever look back."
I thought I knew what love was
What did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got that top pulled down and that radio on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got that hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on, baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone Halfway down the stairs is a stair where I sit,
There isn't any other stair quite like this.
I'm not at the bottom,
I'm not at the top,
So this is the stair where I always stop. Halfway up the stairs,
it isn't up it isn't down,
It isn't in the Nursery it isn't in the town,
And all sorts of funny thoughts,
they run through my head,
It isn't really anywhere,
its somewhere else instead... Halfway down the stairs is a stair where I sit,
There isnt any other stair quite like this,
I'm not at the bottom
I'm not at the top,
So this is the stair where I always
Stop. Way down
I've been way down
Underneath this skin
Waiting to hear my name again I'm sorry
Nothing can hold me
I adore you still
If I hear them calling
And nothing can hold me Way down
(Do you really want me?)
All the way down
(Do you really want me?)
I will hear your voice
(Do you really want me?)
But I'll no longer understand (No one's really loved me) I'm sorry
Nothing can hold me
I adore you still
But I hear them calling I was looking to the sky
When I knew I'd be swimming home
And I cannot betray my kind
They are here, it's my time I'm sorry
Nothing can hold me
(Do you really want me?)
I adore you still
But I hear them calling (calling)
And nothing can hold me All that I'm living for
All that I'm dying for
All that I can't ignore, alone at night I can feel the night beginning
Separate me from the living
Understanding me
After all I've seen
Piecing every thought together
Find the words to make me better
If I only knew
How to pull myself apart All that I'm living for
All that I'm dying for
All that I can't ignore, alone at night
All that I'm wanted for
Although I wanted more
Lock the last open door
My ghosts are gaining on me I believe that dreams are sacred
Take my darkest fears and play them
Like a lullaby
Like a reason why
Like a play of my obsessions
Make me understand the lesson
So I'll find myself
So I won't be lost again All that I'm living for
All that I'm dying for
All that I can't ignore, alone at night
All that I'm wanted for
Although I wanted more
Lock the last open door
My ghosts are gaining on me Guess I thought I'd have to change the world
To make you see me
To be the one
I could have run forever
But how far would I have come
Without mourning your love? All that I'm living for
All that I'm dying for
All that I can't ignore, alone at night
All that I'm wanted for
Although I wanted more
Lock the last open door
My ghosts are gaining on me
Should it hurt to love you?
Should I feel like I do?
Should I lock the last open door?
My ghosts are gaining on me Thought that I was strong
I know the words I need to say
Frozen in my place
I let the moment slip away I've been screaming
On the inside
And I know you feel the pain
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
aaah...
aaah... Say it's over
Yes it's over
But I need you anyway
Say you love me but it's not enough Never meant to lie
But I'm not the girl you think you know
The more that I am with you
The more that I am all alone I've been screaming
On the inside
And I know you feel the pain
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
aaah... aaah...
Say it's over
Yes it's over
But I need you anyway Say you love me but it's not enough
Not that I'm so different
Not that I don't see
the dying light of
what we used to be
But how can I forgive you
Just change And I'm a liar by your side
I'm about to lose my mind
'Cause I've been screaming
On the inside
And I know you feel the pain
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
aaah...
You've been dreaming
If you're thinking
That I still belong to you
And I've been dying
'Cause I'm lying to myself!
aaah...
aaah...
Say it's over
Yes it's over
But I need you anyway
Say you love me but it's not enough

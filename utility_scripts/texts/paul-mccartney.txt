When you were young and your heart was an open book
You used to say live and let live
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever-changing world in which we live in
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
(Live and let die)
Live and let die
(Live and let die)
What does it matter to you?
When you got a job to do
You got to do it well
You got to give the other fellow hell
You used to say live and let live
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever-changing world in which we live in
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
(Live and let die)
Live and let die
(Live and let die) Baby I'm amazed at the way you love me all the time
Maybe I'm afraid of the way I love you
Baby I'm amazed at the the way you pulled me out of time
Hung me on a line
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you Baby I'm a man and maybe I'm a lonely man
Who's in the middle of something
That he doesn't really understand
Babe I'm a man and maybe you're the only woman
Who could ever help me
Baby won't you help to me understand Baby I'm a man and maybe I'm a lonely man
Who's in the middle of something
That he doesn't really understand
Babe I'm a man and maybe you're the only woman
Who could ever help me
Baby won't you help me understand Baby I'm amazed at the way you're with me all the time
Maybe I'm afraid of the way I leave you
Baby I'm amazed at the way you help me sing my song
You right me when I'm wrong
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you We're so sorry, Uncle Albert
We're so sorry if we caused you any pain

LET IT BE Piece of cake! Too many people going underground
Too many reaching for a piece of cake
Too many people pulled and pushed around
Too many waiting for that lucky break That was your first mistake
You took your lucky break and broke it in two
Now what can be done for you?
You broke it in two Too many people sharing party lines
Too many people never sleeping late
Too many people paying parking fines
Too many hungry people losing weight That was your first mistake
You took your lucky break and broke it in two
Now what can be done for you?
You broke it in two Too many people preaching practices
Don't let them tell you what you want to be
Too many people holding back, this is
Crazy and maybe, it's not like me That was your last mistake
I find my love awake and waiting to be
Now what can be done for you?
She's waiting for me. (knock knock)
Someone's knocking at the door (outside)
Somebody's ringing the bell (inside)
Someone's knocking at the door (outside)
Somebody's ringing the bell It's an inside thing (open the door, open the door, open the door)
It's an inside thing (an inside thing) like rides that only take the tall
The water running down the wall
Your nose is pressed against the glass
You left the club without a pass
They closed the door
You can't get in
I don't know where the hell you've been
This behaviour isn't great
Seems to me I'm always late
No matter what you have to say
It's always me that's gotta to pay
Your only just a kiss away
You left me here and yes
It's cold out here
So cold When the night comes down
Always get so lonely here
In this old town
You gotta change the atmosphere
If I had wings
I'd fly my body out of here
Cause when you get the feeling
You need a little healing
You just need protection
Loving and affection
(that's all) Love and affection Oh, Oh, Oh
There's a ghost outside the window
Oh, Oh , Oh
Don't know where he's been
Oh, Oh, Oh
When that old cold wind blows
Open the door and let'em in, oh yeah Someone's knocking at the door (outside)
Somebody's ringing the bell (inside)
Someone's knocking at the door (outside)
Somebody's ringing the bell It's an inside thing (open the door, open the door, open the door)
It's an inside thing Some hearts are made of solid gold
And some are magic I've been told
But ever time that I've been kissed
I'm so aware of all the risks to take
But my bold heart is bare
Cause there's many things in there
Even when we are miles apart
It doesn't matter where we are
Cause you and I knew from the start
The answer lives within the heart
So why are you looking so suprised
You know where the truth survives
Spread your wings (spread your wings, let us sing) When you see my face
Better look behind my eyes
Cause I don't show
Everything I feel inside
Sometimes boy
I've been known to wear disguise
When I get the feeling
I need a little healing
I might need protection
Loving and affection (love and affection) Oh, Oh, Oh
Ghost outside the window
Oh, Oh , Oh
Don't know where he's been
Oh, Oh, Oh
When that old cold wind blows
Open the door, let'em in, oh yeah yeah Someone's knocking at the door (outside)
Someone's ringing the bell (inside)
Someone's knocking at the door (outside)
Someone's ringing the bell It's an inside thing (open the door, open the door, open the door)
It's an inside thing Oh, no, no, babe
I ain't gonna ride
I ain't gonna run
No, no, no babe
I ain't gonna use a gun
You should know babe
When all is said and done
You could be the one
And maybe sometimes we could even have some fun
Oh yeah Well if I knock knock on the door
You gotta let me in
And if I tap tap on the window
Even if it's in
I wanna hip hop all night
You know how old cool boo
With Paul Mac and Lulu
Shouting at the new school
Bringing in the new cools
For students that were tardy
So were fine
Bring your fellows
Cause were having a party
Outside it's getting funky
So let me bring
The moral here "Make it an inside thing" Someone's knocking at the door (Outside)
Somebody's ringing the bell (inside)
Someone's knocking at the door (Outside)
Somebody's ringing the bell It's an inside thing (open the door, open the door, open the door)
It's an inside thing Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Someone's knocking at the door door
(it's an inside thing)
Somebody's ringing the bell
Somebody's knocking at the door, now, now
Somebody's ringing the bell
Ring-ding-ding-ding-a-ding-ding-ding
Ringing the bell
That'll be him This is an open letter
From you and me together
Tomorrow's in our hands now
Find the words that matter
Say them out loud
And make it better somehow Looking down from up on the moon
It's a tiny blue marble
Who'd have thought the ground we stand on
Could be so fragile This is a love song to the earth
You're no ordinary world
A diamond in the universe
Heaven's poetry to us
Keep it safe
Keep it safe
Keep it safe
Cause it's our world
It's our world It's not about possessions,
Money or religion
How many years we might live
When the only real question
That matters is still a matter of perspective Looking down from up on the moon
You're a tiny blue marble
Who'd have thought the ground we stand on
Could be so fragile This is a love song to the earth
You're no ordinary world
A diamond in the universe
Heaven's poetry to us
Keep it safe (Keep it safe, yeah 2x)
Keep it safe (Keep it safe, yeah)
(Keep Keep Keep it safe, yeah)
Keep it safe
Keep mama earth safe
Cause it's our world
It's our world Badabang bang bang bang bang See mama earth is in a crazy mess
I's time for us to do our best
From deep sea straight up to everest
She under crazy stress
Unless you wanna be motherless
Clean heart
Green heart
is the way I stress
Speediness and too much greediness
Six billion people all want plentiness (It's our world)
Some people think this is harmless (It's our world)
But if we continue
There'll only be emptiness Oh no nonono This is a love song to the earth
You're no ordinary world
A diamond in the universe
Heaven's poetry to us (Heaven's poetry to us)
Keep it safe (Keep it safe)
Keep it safe (Keep it safe)
Keep it safe
(Special paradise) Let's keep it safe This is a love song to the earth
You're no ordinary world
A diamond in the universe
Heaven's poetry to us
Keep it safe
Keep it safe
Keep it safe
It's our world
Keep it safe
It's our world
It's our world
It's our world

by Jerry Cope Oh no one left alive in 1985 will ever do
She may be right
She may be fine
She may get love but she won't get mine
'Cause I got you
Oh oh I, oh oh I Well, I just can't enough of that sweet stuff
My little lady gets behind
(Shake it, baby, don't break it) Oh my mama said the time would come
When I would find myself in love with you
I didn't think
I never dreamed
That I would be around to see it all come true
Whoa oh oh I, oh oh I Well, I just can't get enough of that sweet stuff
My little lady gets behind Ah no one left alive in 1985 will ever do
She may be right
She may be fine
She may get love but she won't get mine
'Cause I got you
Oh oh I, oh oh I Well I just can't get enough of that sweet stuff
My little lady left behind (Band on the run, band on the run, band on the run...) Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice
in the church where her wedding has been,
Lives in a dream.
Waits at the window,
Wearing the face that she keeps
in a jar by the door,
Who is it for? All the lonely people, where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people, where do they all belong ? Father Mackenzie, writing the words to a sermon
that no one will hear,
No one comes near. Look at him working,
darning his socks
in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care ? All the lonely people, where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people, where do they all belong ? Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people Eleanor Rigby died in the church
and was buried along with her name
Nobody came. Father Mackenzie, wiping the dirt from his hands
as he walks from the grave
No one was saved. All the lonely people, where do they all come from?
(ah, look at all the lonely people)
All the lonely people, where do they all belong?
(ah, look at all the lonely people) Ram on, give your heart to somebody
Soon right away, right away
Ram on, give your heart to somebody
Soon right away, right away Ram on, give your heart to somebody
Soon right away, right away As I sat in the attic, a piano up my nose,
And the wind played a dreadful cantata. (cantata, cantata)
Sore was I from a crack of an enemy's hose,
And the horrible sound of tomato. (tomato, tomato) Catch up! (catch up!)
Soup and puree! (Soup and puree!)
Don't get left behind. (get left behind)
Catch up (catch up!)
Soup and puree! (Soup and puree!)
Don't get left behind. (get left behind, get left behind, get left behind) When a rattle of rats had awoken,
The sinews, the nerves and the veins.
My piano was boldly outspoken
In attempts to repeat this refrain. So I stood with a knot in my stomach,
And I gazed at that terrible sight,
Of two youngsters concealed in a barrel,
Suckin' Monkberry moon delight, (om pah om pah pah) ho! Monkberry moon delight, (om pah om pah pah)

And my hair is a tangled beretta. (beretta, beretta)
But I leave my pajamas to Billy Budapest,
And I don't get the gist of your letter. (your letter, your letter) Catch up!, (catch up!)
Cats and kittens (cats and kittens)
Don't get left behind. (get left behind)
Catch up, (catch up)

Monkberry moon delight. Burke-Spina My very good friend the milkman says
That I've been losing too much sleep
He doesn't like the hours I keep
And he suggests that you should marry me. My very good friend the mailman says
That it would make his burden less
If we both had the same address
And he suggests that you should marry me. Then there's a very friendly fellow who prints
All the latest real estate news
And every day he sends me blueprints
Of cottages with country views. All my very good friends the neighbours say
That they've been watching little things I do
And they perceive that I love you
So I suggest that you should marry me. Then there's a very friendly fellow who prints

Changing my life with the wave of her hand

Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speking but she doesn't know he's there I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there To be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere Run devil run, the angels having fun

When he gets through, he'll be coming after you,
Listen what I'm saying to you Run... Run Devil Run By a swamp in Alabama in the cold in the damp
Sittin reading by the light of a kerosene lamp
Lives a holly roller with a mission on her mind
Got to spread the word to anybody she can find
You can hear her screaming any time in night or day
This is what she says to keep the demons away Run devil run, the angels having fun
Making winners out of sinners better leave before it's done
When he gets through, he'll be coming after you,
Listen what I'm saying to you Run... Run Devil Run Her brother and her sister said that she brought them down
Steppin on the bus that was heading to town
There they started drinking, they got into a fight
The sheriff introduced them to the jailhouse for a night
When the holy roller came to town to pay the bail
This is what she sang as she was leaving the jail Run devil run, the angels having fun Making winners out of sinners better leave before it's done

To cry their troubles away

To last you all through the years
And the only price you pay
Is heart full of tears Going down to Lonesome Town, where the broken hearts stay

The streets are filled with regret
Maybe down in Lonesome Town

When it comes to rocking she's a queen.
I took her to a dance on a saturday night,
All alone where I can hold her tight.
She lives on the twentieth floor uptown.
The elevator's broken down. And I walk one, two flight, three flight four,
Five six seven flight, eight flight more.
Up on the twelfth I'm starting to sag,
Fifteenth floor I'm ready to drag.
I get to the top and I'm too tired to rock. You know she called me up on the telephone,
Said come on ever baby 'cause I'm all alone.
I said baby you're mighty sweet,
But I'm in bed with aching feet.
This went on for a couple of days,
But I couldn't stay away. And I walk one, two flight, three flight four,
Five six seven flight, eight flight more.
Up on the twelfth I'm starting to sag,
Fifteenth floor I'm ready to drag.
I get to the top and I'm too tired to rock. Well I sent to Chicago for repairs,
Till it's fixed I'm using the stairs.
I hope they hurry, before it's too late,
I want my baby too much to wait.
All this climbing is getting me down,
They'll find me hanging over the rail. And I walk one, two flight, three flight four,
Five six seven flight, eight flight more.
Up on the twelfth I'm starting to sag,
Fifteenth floor I'm ready to drag.
I get to the top and I'm too tired to rock. And I walk one, two flight, three flight four,
Five six seven flight, eight flight more.
Up on the twelfth I'm starting to sag,
Fifteenth floor I'm ready to drag,
I get to the top and I'm too tired to rock. Yesterday,
All my troubles seemed so far away;
Now it looks as though they're here to stay;
Oh, I believe in yesterday. Suddenly,
I'm not half the man I used to be;
There's a shadow hanging over me;
Oh, yesterday came suddenly. Why, she, had to go I don't know,
She wouldn't say;

Now I long for yesterday. Yesterday,
Love was such an easy game to play;
Now I need a place to hide away,
Oh, I believe in yesterday. Why, she, had to go I don't know,
She wouldn't say;

Now I long for yesterday. Yesterday,
Love was such an easy game to play;
Now I need a place to hide away,
Oh, I believe in yesterday. Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm. Speed along the highway

Dancing after midnight, sprawling to the car,
continental breakfast in the bar,
English-speaking people drinking German beer,
talking far too loud for their ears.

Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise. Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free. Blackbird fly Blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night. Blackbird fly Blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night. Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise. There were rules you never told me
Never came up with a plan
All the stories that you sold me
Didn't help me understand But I had to get it worked out
Had nobody who could help
So then in the end it turned out
That I had to do it
By myself... That's the game of rags to riches
Dogs and bitches hunt for fame
Until you think you know which way to turn Make the day all the switches, wicked witches fan the flame
Careful what you touch in case you burn Queenie eye queenie eye who's got the ball
I haven't got it, it isn't in my pocket
O-U-T spells out
That's out
Without a shadow of a doubt
She could put it in about/a pout?
Hear the people shout
Hear the people shout Play the game, taking chances
Every dance is much the same
Doesn't matter which event you choose Never blame the circumstances,
With romances seldom came,?
Never pick a fight youre gonna lose Queenie eye queenie eye who's got the ball
I haven't got it, it isn't in my pocket
O-U-T spells out
That's out
Without a shadow of a doubt
She could put it in about
Hear the people shout
Hear the people shout Its long way, to the finish
When you've never been before
I was nervous, but I did it
Now Im going back for more Eyyy, yeah eyyyy yeah yeah
Eyyy, yeah eyyyy yeah yeah
Here the people shout
Eyyy, yeah eyyyy yeah yeah Queenie eye queenie eye who's got the ball
I havent got it, it isn't in my pocket
O-U-T spells out
That's out
Without a shadow of a doubt
She could put it in a pout
Hear the people shout
Hear the people shout I get a feeling when they call my name
Feels like we're all involved in some kind of game
Oh boy, get me out of here
Oh boy, let me out of here, yeah. I hear the taxman knocking at my door
I've got a feeling he'll be asking for more
Oh boy, get me out of here
Oh boy, someone get me out of here, yeah. Ah, when we fight I don't know what to say
It feels so bad and yet I can run away
Oh boy, get me out of here
I'm a celebrity, oh boy, someone get me out of here. I see the doctor coming down the street
I got no fever but I'm feeling the heat
Oh boy, get me out of here
Oh boy, someone get me out of here
Oh boy, get me out of here
Oh boy, someone get me out of here. Walking In The Park With Eloise is an instrumental song that Paul wrote for his Father. There are no lyrics to this song. Say You Don't Love Him, My Salamander.
Why Do You Need Him?
Oh No, Don't Answer, Oh No. I'm Getting Closer,
I'm Getting Closer To Your Heart. Keeping Ahead Of The Rain On The Road,
Watching My Windscreen Wipers.
Radio Play Me A Danceable Ode,
Cattle Beware Of Snipers. When Will You See Me, My Salamander?
Now Don't Try To Tell Me
Oh No, Don't Answer, Oh No. L'm Getting Closer,
I'm Getting Closer To Your Heart. Hitting The Chisel And Making A Joint,
Glueing My Fingers Together.
Radio Play Me A Song With A Point,
Sailor Beware Of Weather. L'm Getting Closer, My Salamander.
Well When Will We Be There?
Ah No, Don't Answer, Oh No. L'm Getting Closer,
I'm Getting Closer To Your Heart.
I'm Getting Closer To Your Heart.
I'm Getting Closer To Your Heart.

Would they say vendetta

I get pissed, destroy! And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
You cunt, I'm not a queer
I'll state my case of which I'm certain I've lived a life that's full
And each and every highway
And that, much more than this
I did it my way Regrets I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do I saw it through without exemption
I've planned each charted course
Each careful step along the highway
And more, much more than this I did it my way There were times,
I'm sure you knew
When there was fuck, fuck
Fuck all else to do But through it all,
When there was doubt
I shot it up or kicked it out
I faced 'em all and the world And did it my way I've loved and been a snide
I've had my fill, my share of losing And now the tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think, I killed a cat
And might I say not in the die way Oh no, oh no, not me
I did it my way For what is a brat,
What has he got
When he wears hats and he cannot
Say the things he truly feels
But only the words
Of one who kneels
The record shows,
I've stuffed a bloke
And did it my way I am an Antichrist
I am a Anarchist
Don't know what I want but I know how to get it
I wanna destroy the passerby I wanna be anarchy Ba ba doo ba doo bi doom doom doom doom God save the queen (God save the queen)

Just take a look at the work they gave you
It gives the game away
Boredom is normal
And power, the order of the day
Stop your heart from beating And waste your life away [CHORUS] Deny the game they play
Just take a look at the world they've made
It gives the game away
Boredom is normal
And the power, the order of the day
Stop your heart from beating
And throw your life away (away) [CHORUS]

I thought it was the UK
Or just another country
Another council tenancy I wanna be Anarchy
And I wanna be Anarchy
(Oh what a name)
And I wanna be anarchist
I get pissed, destroy! Gentle pretty thing
who only had one spring
you bravely faced the world
ready for anything
i'm happy that you lived
for your life is mine
what have i except to cry
spirit never die
birds of the air
beasts of the earth
overjoyed at bambi's birth they gambolled in the glade
Chorus
who killed bambi? x9
Murder murder murder
someone should be angry
the crime of the century
who shot little bambi
never trust a hippie
'cause i love punky bambi
i'll kill to find the killer
in that rotten roll army
all the spikey punkers
believers in the ruins
with one big shout
they all cry out
who killed bambi?
Chorus x2 You need hands to hold someone you care for...
When you fear... nobody wants to know you
You need hands to brush away the tears... When you hold the brand new baby
You need tender hands to guide them all the way
You need hands to thank the Lord for living...
And forgiving us this day... You need hands to show the world you're happy
And you need hands when you have to stop the bus...
But the hands that we love so dear
Are the hands that we love to hear
Are the hands that You give to us...
Everybody holds the hands that You give to us... Belsen was a gas a read the other day
About the open grave where the Jews all lay
Life is fun and I wish you were here
They wrote in post cards to those held dear Sergeant Majors on the march
Wash the bodies in the starch
See them all die one by one
Guess who's dead? Guess whos glad?
So glad Belsen was a gas a read the other day
About the open grave where the Jews all lay
Life is fun and I wish you were here
They wrote in post cards to those held dear
Oh dear. You think we look pretty good together
You think my shoes are made of leather
But I'm a substitute for another guy
I look pretty tall but my heels are high
The simple things you see are all complicated
I look pretty young, but I'm just back-dated, yeah
Substitute your lies for fact
I can see right through your plastic mac
I look all white, but my dad was black
My fine looking suit is really made out of sack
I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth
The north side of my town faced east, and the east was facing south
And now you dare to look me in the eye
Those crocodile tears are what you cry
It's a genuine problem, you won't try
To work it out at all you just pass it by, pass it by
Substitute me for him
Substitute my coke for gin
Substitute you for my mum
At least I'll get my washing done right here we go now

Too many people support us
An unlimited amount
Too many outlets in and out
Who? EMI

EMI And so our friends are crucified
A day they wish that we had died
We are an addition
We are ruled by none Never ever neverrrrrraaa And you thought that we were faking
That we were all just money making
You do not believe we're for real
Or you would lose your cheap appeal Don't judge a book just by the cover
Unless you cover just another
And blind acceptance is a sign
Of stupid fools who stand in line
Like EMI
EMI
EMI Unlimited edition

That was the only reason
we all had to say goodbye! Unlimited supply (EMI)
There is no reason why (EMI)

You're made in Japan from cheese and chalk
You're hippy tarts hero 'cos you put on a bad show
You put on a bad show, oh don't it show Still, out on those pills
Do you remember? Think it's swell playing Max's Kansas
You're looking bored and you're acting flash
With nothing in your gut you better keep your mouth shut
You better keep your mouth shut in a rut Still, out on those pills
Do you remember? Four years on you still look the same
I think it's 'bout time you changed your brain
You're just a pile of shit, you're coming to this
Poor little faggot, you're sealed with a kiss Four years on you still look the same
I think it's 'bout time you changed your brain
You're just a pile of shit, you're coming to this
Poor little faggot, you're sealed with a kiss Still, out on those pills
Thought you cahnged Looking for a kiss
A kiss, a kiss you're looking for a kiss
Looking for a kiss, you're coming to this Four years on you still look the same
I think it's 'bout time you changed your brain
A kiss, a kiss, looking for a kiss
Now, now, now There's unlimited supply
And there is no reason why
I tell you it was all a frame
They only did it 'cos of fame
Who? E.M.I. E.M.I. E.M.I. Too many people had the suss
Too many people support us
Un unlimited amount
Too many outlets in and out
Who? E.M.I E.M.I E.M.I And sir and friends are crucified
A day they wished that we had died
We are an addition
We are ruled by none
Never ever never And you thought that we were faking
That we were all just money making
You do not believe we're for real
Or you would lose your cheap appeal? Don't judge a book just by the cover
Unless you cover just another
And blind acceptance is a sign
Of stupid fools who stand in line
Like E.M.I E.M.I E.M.I Unlimted edition
With an unlimited supply
That was the only reason
We all had to say goodbye Unlimited supply (E.M.I)
There is no reason why (E.M.I)

They only did it 'cos of fame (E.M.I)

I can't stand those useless fools (E.M.I)
Unlimited supply (E.M.I)

I don't turn this want
To make beautiful word that goes on and on
And on and on
Those 13 years in prison
Didn't teach me how to love
They say they have their reasons
All coming from above
You can forget the seasons inside your factory
There's one thing they can't teach you is how to feel free
And stand alone in a beautiful world
We have to respond...
Schools are prisons
Forget the seasons
Schools are prisons
Schools are one of the reasons for this waste of the spring
And where to begin
Outside or within
It took the best years of my life
And made it so I couldn't decide
Statistic as in prisons
Statistic as in life
They say they had their reasons
But coming from above
You got what their decisions inside your factory
But one thing they can't teach you is how to feel free
And stand up in the beautiful world
We only respond...
Schools are prisons
Forget the seasons
Schools are prisons
One of the reasons for this waste of the spring
Where to begin
Outside or within
Schools are prisons
Forget the seasons
Schools are prisons
One of the reasons
Schools are prisons
Forget the seasons
Schools are prisons
One of the reasons for this waste of the spring

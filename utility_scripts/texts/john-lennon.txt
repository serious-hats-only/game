Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one Close your eyes
Have no fear
The monster's gone
He's on the run and your daddy's here Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy Before you go to sleep
Say a little prayer
Every day in every way
It's getting better and better Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy Out on the ocean sailing away
I can hardly wait to see you come of age
But I guess, we'll both just have to be patient
'Cause it's a long way to go, a hard row to hoe
Yes, it's a long way to go but in the meantime Before you cross the street
Take my hand
Life is what happens to you
While you're busy making other plans Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy Before you go to sleep
Say a little prayer
Every day in every way
It's getting better and better
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy

By giving you no time instead of it all
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be When they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years
Then they expect you to pick a career
When you can't really function you're so full of fear
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV
And you think you're so clever and classless and free
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be There's room at the top they are telling you still
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill
If you want to be like the folks on the hill
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
If you want to be a hero well just follow me
If you want to be a hero well just follow me Oh my love for the first time in my life
My eyes are wide open
Oh my lover for the first time in my life
My eyes can see I see the wind
Oh I see the trees
Everything is clear in my heart I see the clouds
Oh I see the sky
Everything is clear in our world Oh my love for the first time in my life
My mind is wide open
oh my lover for the first time in my life
My mind can feel I feel the sorrow

All my life, though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends
I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life I love you more We're playin' those mind games together
Pushin' the barriers, plantin' seeds
Playin' the mind guerrilla
Chantin' the mantra, peace on earth We all been playin' those mind games forever
Some kinda druid dude liftin' the veil
Doin' the mind guerrilla
Some call it magic, the search for the grail Love is the answer
And you know that for sure
Love is a flower
You gotta let it, you gotta let it grow So keep on playin' those mind games together
Faith in the future, outta the now
You just can't beat on those mind guerrillas
Absolute elsewhere in the stones of your mind Yeah, we're playin' those mind games forever
Projectin' our images in space and in time Yes is the answer
And you know that for sure
Yes is surrender
You gotta let it, you gotta let it go So keep on playin' those mind games together
Doin' the ritual dance in the sun
Millions of mind guerrillas
Puttin' their soul power to the karmic wheel
Keep on playin' those mind games forever
Raisin' the spirit of peace and love
Love
I want you to make love, not war
I know you've heard it before Grow old along with me
The best is yet to be
When our time has come
We will be as one
God bless our love God bless our love
Grow old along with me
Two branches of one tree
Face the setting sun
When the day is done God bless our love
God bless our love
Spending our lives together Man and wife together
World without end
World without end
Grow old along with me
Whatever fate decrees
We will see it through
For our love is true
God bless our love
God bless our love Three, four! Everybody's talking and no one says a word
Everybody's making love and no one really cares
There's Nazis in the bathroom just below the stairs Always something happening and nothing going on
There's always something cooking and nothing in the pot
They're starving back in China so finish what you got Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Strange days indeed -- strange days indeed Everybody's runnin' and no one makes a move
Everyone's a winner and nothing left to lose
There's a little yellow idol to the north of Katmandu Everybody's flying and no one leaves the ground
Everybody's crying and no one makes a sound
There's a place for us in the movies you just gotta lay around Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Strange days indeed -- most peculiar, mama Everybody's smoking and no one's getting high
Everybody's flying and never touch the sky
There's a UFO over New York and I ain't too surprised
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Strange days indeed -- most peculiar, mama, roll! So long, long ago
Was it in a dream?
Was it just a dream?
I know, yes, I know
Seemed so very real
Seemed so real to me Took a walk down the street
Through the heat whispered trees
I thought I could hear, hear, hear, hear
Somebody call out my name
As it started to rain
Two spirits dancing, so strange Ah! böwakawa poussè, poussè
Ah! böwakawa poussè, poussè
Ah! böwakawa poussè, poussè Dream, dream away
Magic in the air
Was magic in the air?
I believe, yes, I believe
More I cannot say
What more can I say? On a river of sound
Through the mirror go round, round
I thought I could feel, feel, feel, feel
Music touching my soul
Something warm, sudden cold
The spirit dance was unfolding Ah! böwakawa poussè, poussè
Ah! böwakawa poussè, poussè
Ah! böwakawa poussè, poussè
Ah! böwakawa poussè, poussè
Ah! böwakawa poussè, poussè

We have grown, we have grown
Although our love is still special
Let's take a chance and fly away somewhere alone It's been too long since we took the time
No-one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over, starting over Everyday we used to make it love
Why can't we be making love nice and easy
It's time to spread our wings and fly
Don't let another day go by my love
It'll be just like starting over, starting over Why don't we take off alone
Take a trip somewhere far, far away
We'll be together all alone again
Like we used to in the early days
Well, well darling It's been too long since we took the time
No-one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling

Designed to enlighten me When I tell them that I'm doing fine
Watching shadows on the wall
Don't you miss the big time, boy?
You're no longer on the ball I'm just sitting here
Watching the wheels go round and round
I really love to watch them roll No longer riding on the merry-go-round

You better see right through that mother's eyes
Those freaks was right when they said you was dead
The one mistake you made was in your head How do you sleep?
How do you sleep at night? You live with straights who tell you, you was king
Jump when your momma tell you anything
The only thing you done was yesterday
And since you've gone you're just another day How do you sleep?
How do you sleep at night? How do you sleep?
How do you sleep at night? A pretty face may last a year or two
But pretty soon they'll see what you can do
The sound you make is muzak to my ears
You must have learned something in all those years How do you sleep?
How do you sleep at night? You can shine your shoes and wear a suit
you can comb your hair and look quite cute
you can hide your face behind a smile
one thing you can't hide
is when you're crippled inside
you can wear a mask and paint your face
you can call yourself the human race
you can wear a collar and a tie
one thing you can't hide
is when you're crippled inside
Well now you know that your
cat has nine lives
nine lives to itself
but you only got one
and a dog's life ain't fun
mamma take a look outside
You can go to church and sing a hymn

you can live a lie until you die
one thing you can't hide
is when you're crippled inside
Well now you know that your

Don't they know we're so afraid?
Isolation
We're afraid to be alone
Everybody got to have a home
Isolation Just a boy and a little girl
Trying to change the whole wide world
Isolation
The world is just a little town
Everybody trying to put us down
Isolation I don't expect you to understand
After you've caused so much pain
But then again, you're not to blame
You're just a human, a victim of the insane We're afraid of everyone
Afraid of the sun
Isolation
The sun will never disappear
But the world may not have many years
Isolation So, this is Christmas

And in return for miss Yoko Ono's wonderful gift of a very strange
I'd like, this morning, to sing you a little ditty that occurred to me in the throes of my sleep
It's called "Life Begins At 40" They say life begins at forty
Age is just a state of mind
If all that's true
You know, that I've been dead for thirty-nine And if life begins at forty
Well, I hope it ain't the same
It's been tough enough without that stuff
I don't wanna to be born again Well, I tried to sweep the slate clean
With a new broom ev'ry day
If that don't work
I'll jerk around until my next birthday Yeah, life begins at forty
Age is just a state of mind
Well, if all that's true
You know that I've been dead for thirty-nine In the middle of the night,
In the middle of the night I call your name,
Oh Yoko,
Oh Yoko,
My love will turn you on, In the middle of the bath,
In the middle of the bath I call your name,
Oh Yoko,
Oh Yoko,
My love will turn you on,

Oh Yoko Intro: You say you found Jesus Christ
He's the only one
You say you've found Buddha
Sittin' in the sun
You say you found Mohammed
Facin' to the East
You say you found Krishna
Dancin' in the streets Well there's somethin' missing in this God Almighty stew
And it's your mother (your mother, don't forget your mother, lad)
You got to serve yourself
Ain't nobody gonna do it for you
You got to serve yourself
Ain't nobody gonna do it for you
Well you may believe in devils and you may believe in lords
But if you don't go out and serve yourself, lad, ain't no room service here It's still the same old story
A bloody Holy War
A fight for love and glory
Ain't gonna study war no more
A fight for God and country
We're gonna set you free
We'll put you back in the Stone Age
If you won't be like me - get it? You got to serve yourself
Ain't nobody gonna do for you
You got to serve yourself
Ain't nobody gonna do for you
Well you may believe in devils and you may believe in lords 'But Christ, you're gonna have to serve yourself and that's all there is to it.
So get right back here it's in the bloody fridge. God, when I was a kid.
Didn't have stuff like this, TV-fuckin' dinners and all that crap.
You fuckin' kids are all the fuckin' same! Want a fuckin' car now...
Lucky to have a pair of shoes!' You tell me you found Jesus Christ
Well that's great and he's the only one
You say you just found Buddha
Sittin' on his ass in the sun
You say you found Mohammed
Kneeling on a bloody carpet facin' the East
You say you found Krishna
With a bald head dancin' in the street ('Well, Christ, now you're
being heard') You got to serve yourself
Ain't nobody gonna do for you
You got to serve yourself
Ain't nobody gonna do for you ('that's right, lad, you better get that straight
into your fuckin' head')
You got to serve yourself ('you know that, who else is gonna do it for you, it
ain't me I tell you that')
Well, you may believe in Jesus, and you may believe in Marx
And you may believe in Marks and Spencer's and you may believe in bloody
Woolworths
But there's something missing in this whole bloody stew
And it's your mother, your poor bloody mother ('she worked for you in the
back bedroom, full of piss and shit and fuckin' midwives. God, you can't
forget that awful moment, you know. You should have been in the bloody
war, lad, and you would know all about it. Well, I'll tell you something.') It's still the same old story
A Holy bloody War, you know, with the Pope and all that stuff
A fight for love and glory
Ain't gonna study no more war
A fight for God and country, and the Queen and all that
We're gonna set you free
Bomb you back into the fuckin' Stone Age
If you won't be like me, you know, get down on your knees and pray Well there's somethin' missing in this God Almighty stew
And it's your goddamn mother you dirty little git, now
get in there and wash yer ears! 
NOTE: "[This song] was right after Dylan's song [...] "You
Gotta Serve Someone", you know - the lord, I suppose, you know.
So then he was kind of upset about that and it was a dialogue,
you know. In that sense it's fun, I mean you can hear it was
fun. He wasn't seriously against it. He showed his anger in
a way but also [...] his sense of humour." (Yoko Ono, 1998) The years have passed so quickly
One thing I've understood
I am only learning
To tell the trees from wood I know what's coming down
And I know where it's coming from
And I know and I'm sorry (yes I am)
But I never could speak my mind And I know just how you feel
And I know now what I have done
And I know and I'm guilty
But I never could speak my mind I know what I was missing
But now my eyes can see
I put myself in your place
As you did for me Today I love you more than yesterday
Right now I love you more right now Now I know what's coming down
I can feel where it's coming from
And I know it's getting better all the time
As we share in each other's minds Yes, I'm your angel
I'll give you everything
In my magic power
So make a wish
And I'll let it come true for you
Tra, la, la, la, la You're my fairy
You gave me everything
I ever wanted from life
Have I made a wish
And is that why I have you?
Tra, la, la, la, la We believe in pumpkins that turn into princess
And frogs that turn into prince
We believe in moons that smile to us
When we hurry home before the midnight strikes
Tra, la, la, la, la Yes, I'm so pretty
You're so dizzy
And we're so happy every day
Let's make a wish
And let it come true for us
Tra, la, la, la, la I'm in your pocket
You're in my locket
And we're so lucky in every way
We make a wish
And let it come true for us
Tra, la, la, la, la We believe in houses built in the sky
And love that lifts us high
We believe in the sun that looks over our shoulders
And brings our shadows together
Tra, la, la, la, la Yes, our hearts are one
Our bodies, too
And it's so good, hm, every time
We make a wish
And let it come true for you, too
Tra, la, la, la, la Happy birthday, my love, I'm your angel
I'll give you everything In my magic power
So make a wish
And I'll let it come true for you
Tra, la, la, la, la, la So this is Christmas
And what have you done
Another year over
And a new one just begun
And so this is Christmas
I hope you have fun
The near and the dear ones
The old and the young A very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear And so this is Christmas War is over
For weak and for strong If you want it
For rich and the poor ones War is over
The world is so wrong Now
And so Happy Christmas War is over

For yellow and red ones War is over
Let's stop all the fight Now A very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear And so this is Christmas War is over
And what have we done If you want it
Another year over War is over

The near and the dear one War is over
The old and the young Now A very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear War is over if you want it
War is over now How can I go forward when I don't know which way I'm facing?
How can I go forward when I don't know which way to turn?
How can I go forward into something I'm not sure of?
Oh no, oh no How can I have feeling when I don't know if it's a feeling?
How can I feel something if I just don't know how to feel?
How can I have feelings when my feelings have always been denied?
Oh no, oh no You know life can be long
And you got to be so strong
And the world is so tough
Sometimes I feel I've had enough How can I give love when I don't know what it is I'm giving?
How can I give love when I just don't know how to give?
How can I give love when love is something I ain't never had?
Oh no, oh no You know life can be long
You've got to be so strong
And the world she is tough
Sometimes I feel I've had enough How can we go forward when we don't know which way we're facing?
How can we go forward when we don't know which way to turn?
How can we go forward into something we're not sure of?
Oh no, oh no All the little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
All they really needed from you
Was, maybe, some love All the little boys and girls
Living in this crazy world
All they really needed from you
Was, maybe, some love Why must we be alone?
Why must we be alone?
It's real life
Yes, it's real I don't expect you to understand
The kingdom of Heaven is in your hands
I don't expect you to wake from the dream
Too late for crying, now, that it seems All their little plans and schemes
Ain't nothing but a bunch of dreams
All you really needed to do
Was, maybe, some love. Here in some stranger's room
Late in the afternoon
What am I doing here at all?
Ain't no doubt about it
I'm losing you
I'm losing you Somehow the wires got crossed
Communication's lost
Can't even get you on the telephone
Just got to shout about it
I'm losing you
I'm losing you Here in the valley of indecision
I don't know what to do
I feel you slipping away
I feel you slipping away
I'm losing you
I'm losing you You say you're not getting enough
But I remind you of all that, bad stuff
So what the hell am I supposed to do?
Just put a bandaid on it?
And stop the bleeding now
Stop the bleeding now I know I hurt you then
But hell, that was way back when
Well, do you still have to carry that cross?
Don't want to hear about it
I'm losing you
I'm losing you Close your eyes
Have no fear
The monster's gone
He's on the run and your daddy's here
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy Before you go to sleep
Say a little prayer
Every day in every way
It's getting better and better Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy Out on the ocean
Sailing away
I can hardly wait
To see you come of age
But I guess we'll both just have to be patient
'Cause it's a long way to go
A hard row to hoe
Yes it's a long way to go
But in the meantime Before you cross the street
Take my hand
Life is what happens to you
While you're busy making other plans Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy Before you go to sleep
Say a little prayer
Every day in every way
It's getting better and better
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy

Good night, Sean
See you in the morning Our life together is so precious together

And fly away somewhere alone It's been too long since we took the time
No one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darlin'
It's like we both are fallin' in love again
It'll be just like starting over, starting over Every day we used to make it love
Why can't we be making love nice and easy?
It's time to spread our wings and fly
Don't let another day go by, my love

Yes, i'm lonely, wanna die.
If i ain't dead already,
Hoo, girl, you know the reason why. In the mornin', wanna die;
In the evenin', wanna die.
If i ain't dead already,
Hoo, girl, you know the reason why. My mother was of the sky,
My father was of the earth;
But i am of the universe,
And you know what it's worth. I'm lonely, wanna die.
If i ain't dead already,
Hoo, girl, you know the reason why. The eagle picks my eye,
The worm he licks my bone;
I feel so suicidal,
Just like dylan's mister jones. Lonely, wanna die.
If i ain't dead already,
Hoo, girl, you know the reason why. Black cloud crossed my mind,
Blue mist round my soul,
Feel so suicidal,
Even hate my rock and roll. I'm lonely, wanna die, yeah!
If i ain't dead already,
Hoo, girl, you know the reason why. Remember when you were young?
How the hero was never hung
Always got away
Remember how the man
Used to leave you empty handed? Always, always let you down
If you ever change your mind
About leaving it all behind
Remember, remember, today And don't feel sorry
The way it's gone
And don't you worry
'Bout what you've done Just remember when you were small
How people seemed so tall
Always had their way
Do you remember your Ma and Pa
Just wishing for movie stardom
Always, always playing a part
If you ever feel so sad
And the whole world is driving you mad
Remember, remember, today And don't feel sorry
'Bout the way it's gone
And don't you worry
'Bout what you've done No, no, remember, remember

Keep you occupied with pie in the sky
There ain't no Guru who can see through your eyes
I - I found out!

I seen religion from Jesus to Paul
Don't let them fool you with dope and cocaine
Can't do you no harm to feel your own pain

I - I found this out!
I - I found out... Temperature's rising
Fever is high
Can't see no future
Can't see no sky My feet are so heavy
So is my head
I wish I was a baby
I wish I was dead Cold turkey has got me on the run My body is aching
Goose-pimple bone
Can't see no body
Leave me alone My eyes are wide open
Can't get to sleep
One thing I'm sure of
I'm in at the deep freeze Cold turkey has got me on the run Cold turkey has got me on the run Thirty-six hours
Rolling in pain
Praying to someone
Free me again Oh I'll be a good boy
Please make me well
I promise you anything
Get me out of this hell Cold turkey has got me on the run
Oh, oh, oh, oh So long ago
Was it in a dream, was it just a dream?
I know, yes I know
Seemed so very real, it seemed so real to me Took a walk down the street
Thru the heat whispered trees
I thought I could hear (hear, hear, hear)
Somebody call out my name (John) as it started to rain Two spirits dancing so strange Ah! böwakawa poussè, poussè
Ah! böwakawa poussè, poussè
Ah! böwakawa poussè, poussè Dream, dream away
Magic in the air, was magic in the air?
I believe, yes I believe
More I cannot say, what more can I say? On a river of sound
Thru the mirror go round, round
I thought I could feel (feel, feel, feel)
Music touching my soul, something warm, sudden cold
The spirit dance was unfolding Ah! böwakawa poussè, poussè
Ah! böwakawa poussè, poussè
Ah! böwakawa poussè, poussè Ah! böwakawa poussè, poussè
Ah! böwakawa poussè, poussè
Ah! böwakawa poussè, poussè
Ah! böwakawa poussè, poussè
Ah! böwakawa poussè, poussè
Ah! böwakawa poussè, poussè
Ah! böwakawa poussè, poussè
Ah! böwakawa poussè, poussè You are my weakness
You are my strength
Nothing I have in the world

That I'm the door and you're the key And ev'ry morning
I wake in your smile
Feeling your breath on my face
And the love in your eyes
'Cause you're the honey and I'm the bee (Toot-toot-toot)
One day at a time is all we do-be-doo-be-doo
One day at a time is good for
You
Us two
You too
Oh-oh Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do do do
Do do do do
'Cause I'm the fish and you're the sea
'Cause I'm the apple and you're the tree

Hey, hey, hey, alright My intentions are good
I use my intuition, it takes me for a ride
But I never understood
Other people's superstitions
It seemed like suicide As I play the game of life
I try to make it better each and every day
And when I struggle in the night
The magic of the music seems to light the way Intuition takes me there
Intuition takes me everywhere Well, my instincts are fine
I had to learn to use them in order to survive
And time after time confirmed an old suspicion
It's good to be alive And when I'm deep down and out
And lose communication
With nothing left to say
It's then I realize it's only a condition
Of seeing things that way Intuition takes me there
Intuition takes me anywhere
It takes me anywhere, alright Intuition takes me there
Intuition takes me there
Intuition takes me there Intuition takes me there
Intuition takes me there
Intuition takes me there Whatever gets you through the night 'salright, 'salright

When they shot the people there
The cries of thirteen martyrs
Filled the Free Derry air
Is there any one amongst you
Dare to blame it on the kids?
Not a soldier boy was bleeding
When they nailed the coffin lids! 
Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday's the day! 
You claim to be majority
Well you know that it's a lie
You're really a minority
On this sweet emerald isle
When Stormont bans our marches
They've got a lot to learn
Internment is no answer
It's those mothers' turn to burn! 
Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday's the day! 
Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday's the day! 
You anglo pigs and scotties
Sent to colonize the North
You wave your bloody Union Jack
And you know what it's worth!
How dare you hold to ransom
A people proud and free
Keep Ireland for the Irish
Put the English back to sea! 
Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday's the day! 
Well, it's always bloody Sunday
In the concentration camps
Keep Falls Road free forever
From the bloody English hands
Repatriate to Britain
All of you who call it home
Leave Ireland to the Irish
Not for London or for Rome! 
Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday's the day! 
Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday's the day! 
Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday's the day!

You gotta drink
You gotta feel something
You gotta worry
But it's so hard, it's really hard
Sometimes I feel like going down But when it's good
It's really good
And when I hold you in my arms baby
Sometimes I feel like going down You gotta run
You gotta hide
You gotta keep your woman satisfied
But it's so hard, it's really hard
Sometimes I feel like going down The night we met I knew I needed you so
And if I had the chance I'd never let you go
So won't you say you love me
I'll make you so proud of me
We'll make them turn their heads every place we go So won't you please

peace.
Good morning meine damen und herren, this is the peace call. John: what we're really doing is sending out a message to the world, mainly to the youth, especially the youth or anybody really that's interested in protesting for peace, or protesting against any form of violence and we say everybody's getting a bit heavy or bit intellectual about it. Everybody's talking about peace, but nobody's doing anything about it, except for a few people, and the things are, the grosvenor square marches in london. The end product of it was just newspaper stories about riots and fightings. And we did the bed event in amsterdam and the bag piece in vienna just to give people an idea, that there's many ways of protest and this is one of them. And anybody could grow their hair for peace or give up a week of their holiday for peace or sit in a bag for peace, protest against peace anyway, but peacefully cause we think that peace is only got by peaceful methods and that to fight the establishment with their own weapons is no good, because they always win and they'd been winning for thousands of years. They know how to play the game violence and it's easier for them when they can recognise you and shoot you. They don't know how to handle humour, peaceful humour and that's our message really. Questioner: what do you think was the biggest success in history, about 300 years? John: haven't a clue. Yoko: well, maybe it's still yet to happen, you see. That's why we're trying to do it. In other words, by very, very peaceful methods to bring peace, you know instead of peace through violence, that's what we're trying to do and if we succeed in that, that's the biggest happening yet in the last 300 years, because it's never been done and nobody has really tried it, you see. And that's what we're trying to do. Questioner: what would you do in case of a war? John: how do you mean? Questioner: what would you do immediately if you would wake up in the morning, read the newspapers and they would tell you england is in war with france? John: i'd die of fright. Yoko: i don't think that should happen. You talk as if something's going to happen aside of us. We are all in this you see. We are all in the same society and in the same world and everything that happens to us is our responsibility, you know. Like any violence going in the world is just a symbol of all the violent atmosphere that is in the world, you see and when the nazism persecuted the jewish people that wasn't only hitler, who did it or germany, who did it, but just a symbol of everybody in the world who had the feeling for the persecution of jews, you see. So we share everything, so that's not gonna happen, if there's war suddenly, that's our fault, you know. Questioner: so what do you think about the behaviour of austrian and germans during the second world war? Don't you think that they're a little bit more responsible than the others? John: no, not particularly. Yoko: no, not particularly. No. The whole world, if the whole world was really aware of it and if the journalists and the communication media of those days were really aware of their responsibility as well and reported everything correct, you know, well, which is almost impossible, i'm sure, but as much as possible and if the whole world was aware of their responsibility, it could have been stopped, i'm sure. John: well, we know that britain and a few other counties waited quite a long time before they made any decision about what to do. I'm not quite sure of the facts, you know, but after czechoslovakia and things like that, they could've stopped it earlier, but they waited until it's on the doorstep, you know, until it involves their money, their territory. Questioner: there's a special type of petition that is vetoed by special contents .. John: no. I don't think so because... Questioner: hitler could have been voted by the french, for instance. John: every nation will have a prototype. I think i was out talking to one of the austrian tv guys. I said can you name me one european country which hasn't sort of raped the world and he said austria actually was the only one that didn't attack anybody else. They were always on the defensive side, i don't know whether that's true. Qustioner: but they were silent at the wrong moment... John: okay, that's bad, i agree that silence is bad. But i mean there isn't one european country that hasn't had its hitler in one way or the other, including britain, in what they did to india and south africa, you know. Yoko: so let's so back to the future, you know. So that's why we're here. We want to talk mainly to the young people all over the world, because those are the people who are going to be the next generation. They're going to be the next world, you know, and we just want to say we are with them. We're not preaching or anything like that. We want to be with them and we're with them and in our way, we're just
announcing that we're open to all invitations or suggestions or anything to work for the world peace, you see, and we're doing it now, in our own way, which we think is the best for us and also the young people have to realise that this is just as bad as before the second world war or right in the middle of it, you know, that everything, all the violence that is happening in the world now are our responsibility and if we don't really realise it and immediately start something, action, you know, it's going to be bad, you know. And it will be exactly like you said. One morning, we find in the newspaper, find that the whole world is going to disappear, you know. Questioner: i agree with you, but don't you see, i mean, it's a fact that by through your behaviour, i think it's okay, but for a lot of people, through your behaviour, to get suspicious. They don't think that this can be correct, people sitting under a tablecloth protesting against wars. They don't think... Yoko: okay, before they criticise us, you know, and if they want to criticise us, okay, go ahead, and they should do it in their own way, but do something, you know. Questioner: so everybody should throw out his part of hitler out of his soul, then? John: yes, yes, we all have it in us. In a way, we're saying we want peace and we're staying in bed for peace, but i'm as violent as the next man, and i'm sure Yoko is just as violent just as well. We're violent people, you know. I prefer myself when i'm non-violent. I prefer me friends when they're non-violent. It just makes for easier living and if we have to have violence, let's channel it, you know. I don't know how, you know, there's other people can work out how to channel it, or give them somewhere to play and kill each other or something. But i don't want to be involved in their violence. I prefer to live in peace, you know. Yoko: all you need is courage, you know. You can just go out in the street now and take off all your clothes and just say peace you know and you'll be in the news you see. Just courage and if everybody gets courage and of course they would, because they would think all right maybe this is a little bit embarrassing thing to do, but look at John and Yoko they're doing worse, so i can do it, you know. That's all we're trying to do, you see. Questioner: so you're putting courage, also, into the world? John: we hope so. Yoko: i hope so. John: okay. Stay in bed! John: look there's a fly flitting around. Just makes you laugh. Yoko: what time is it? John: what's the time? Yoko: what? John: 9:30.good morning.

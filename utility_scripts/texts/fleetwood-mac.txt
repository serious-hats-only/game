When I see you again
Will it be the same
When I see you again
Will it be over
When I see you again
Will your great eyes still say [Chorus]
What's the matter, baby
What's the matter, baby
What's the matter, baby, baby, baby
What's the matter, baby
What's the matter, baby
What's the matter, baby, baby So she walks slowly down the hall
There are many doors in the hallway
And she stares at the stairs
Ooh there are many things to stare at these days
If she sees him again
Will your very best friend
Will your very best friend
Oh, have been replaced by some other [Chorus] And the dream says I want you
And the dream is gone
So she stays up night on end
Well at least there is a dream left If I see you again
Will it be over
If I see you again
Will it be the same
If I see you again
Will it be over
Again and again
Over and over I took my love, I took it down
Climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
'Til the landslide brought it down
Oh, mirror in the sky
What is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changin' ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life? Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Even children get older
And I'm getting older, too Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Even children get older
And I'm getting older, too
Oh, I'm getting older, too I took my love, I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well the landslide will bring it down
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well the landslide will bring it down
Oh, the landslide will bring it down Now here you go again, you say
You want your freedom
Well who am I to keep you down
It's only right that you should
Play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound
Of your loneliness
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost, and what you had, and what you lost Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself, it's only me
Who wants to wrap around your dreams and,
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness,
Like a heartbeat, drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering, what you had,
And what you lost and what you had and what you lost Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know, you will know, you'll know Listen to the wind blow, watch the sun rise
Running in the shadows, damn your love, damn your lies And if, you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain) And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain) Listen to the wind blow, down comes the night
Running in the shadows, damn your love, damn your lies
Break the silence, damn the dark, damn the light And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain) And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain) And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain) Chain keep us together (running in the shadow)
Chain keep us together (running in the shadow)
Chain keep us together (running in the shadow)
Chain keep us together (running in the shadow)
Chain keep us together (running in the shadow)
Chain keep us together (running in the shadow) Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night and
Wouldn't you love to love her?
Takes to the sky like a bird in flight and
Who will be her lover? All your life you've never seen
A woman taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win? She is like a cat in the dark and then
She is the darkness
She rules her life like a fine skylark and when
The sky is starless All your life you've never seen
A woman taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?
Will you ever win? Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon She rings like a bell through the night and
Wouldn't you love to love her?
She rules her life like a bird in flight and
Who will be her lover? All your life you've never seen
A woman taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?
Will you ever win? Rhiannon

Taken by the sky Dreams unwind
Love's a state of mind Dreams unwind
Love's a state of mind Dreams unwind
Love's a state of mind Can you hear me calling
Out your name
You know that I'm falling and I don't know what to say I'll speak a little louder
I'll even shout
You know that I'm proud and I can't get the words out Oh I
I want to be with you everywhere
Oh I
I want to be with you everywhere
(Wanna be with you everywhere) Something's happening
Happening to me
My friends say I'm acting peculiarly C'mon baby

Oh I
I want to be with you everywhere
Oh I
I want to be with you everywhere
(Wanna be with you everywhere) So I'm back to the velvet underground
Back to the floor that I love
To a room with some lace and paper flowers
Back to the gypsy that I was to the gypsy that I was And it all comes down to you
Well you know that it does, well
Lightning strikes maybe once maybe twice
Oh and it lights up the night
And you see you're a gypsy
You see you're a gypsy To the gypsy
That remains
She faces freedom
With a little fear
Well I have no fear
I have only love
And if I was a child
And the child was enough
Enough for me to love
Enough to love She is dancing away from you now
She was just a wish
She was just a wish
And her memory is all that is left for you now
You see you're a gypsy
You see you're a gypsy Lightning strikes
Maybe once maybe twice
And it all comes down to you
Oh oh well it all comes down to you
Lightning strikes
Maybe once maybe twice
Oh
I still see your bright eyes bright eyes
And I've always loved you
And it all comes down to you
It all comes down to you Loving you
Isn't the right thing to do
How can I ever change things
That I feel If I could
Maybe I'd give you my world
How can I
When you won't take it from me You can go your own way
Go your own way
You can call it
Another lonely day
You can go your own way
Go your own way Tell me why
Everything turned around
Packing up
Shacking up is all you want to do If I could
Baby I'd give you my world
Open up
Everything's waiting for you You can go your own way
Go your own way
You can call it
Another lonely day
You can go your own way
Go your own way You can go your own way
Go your own way
You can call it
Another lonely day
Another lonely day
You can go your own way
Go your own way
You can call it
Another lonely day You can go your own way
You can call it
Another lonely day
You can go your own way Wait a minute baby
Stay with me awhile
Said you'd give me light
But you never told me about the fire Drowning in the sea of love
Where everyone would love to drown
But now it's gone
It doesn't matter what for
When you build your house
Then call me home And he was just like a great dark wing
Within the wings of a storm
I think I had met my match, he was singing
And undoing, and undoing the laces
Undoing the laces Said Sara, you're the poet in my heart
Never change, never stop
But now it's gone
It doesn't matter what for
But when you build your house
Then call me home Hold on
The night is coming and the starling flew for days
I'd stay home at night, all the time
I'd go anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
Ask me and I'm there, yeah
Ask me and I'm there, I care In the sea of love
Where everyone would love to drown
But now it's gone
They say it doesn't matter anymore
When you build your house
Then please call me home Sara, you're the poet in my heart
Never change, and don't you ever stop
Now it's gone
No it doesn't matter anymore
When you build your house
I'll come by Sara
Sara If you wake up and don't want to smile
If it take just a little while
Open your eyes and look at the day
You'll see things in a different way Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be, better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone Why not think about times to come
And not about the things that you've done
If your life was bad to you
Just think what tomorrow will do Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be, better than before,
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone All I want is to see you smile
If it takes just a little while
I know you don't believe that it's true
I never meant any harm to you Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be, better than before,
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be, better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone (Ooh) don't you look back
(Ooh) don't you look back
(Ooh) don't you look back
(Ooh) don't you look back For you, there'll be no more crying.
For you, the sun will be shining.
And I feel that when I'm with you,
It's alright, I know it's right. To you, I'll give the world.
To you, I'll never be cold.
'Cause I feel that when I'm with you,
It's alright, I know it's right. And the songbirds are singing, like they know the score.
And I love you, I love you, I love you, like never before. And I wish you all the love in the world.
But most of all, I wish it from myself. And the songbirds keep singing, like they know the score
And I love you, I love you, I love you
Like never before, like never before, like never before. Have mercy, baby on a poor girl like me,
You know I'm falling, falling, falling, at your feet,
I'm tingling right from my head to my toes,
So help me, help me, help me make the feeling go. 'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down,
And there's not another living soul around,
Then you woo me until the sun comes up,
And you say that you love me. Have pity baby,
Just when I thought it was over,
Now you got me running, running, running for cover.
I'm begging you for a little sympathy,
And if you use me again it'll be the end of me. 'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down,
There's not another living soul around,
You woo me until the sun comes up,
And you say that you love me. Baby, baby, hope you're going to stay away,
'Cause I'm getting weaker, weaker, everyday,
I guess I'm not as strong as I used to be,
And if you use me again it'll be the end of me. 'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down,
There's not another living soul around,
You woo me until the sun comes up,
And you say that you love me. 'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down,
Yhere's not another living soul around,
You woo me until the sun comes up,
And you say that you love me.
Say that you love me
Say that you love me Fallin' fallin' fallin'
Fallin' fallin' fallin'
Fallin' fallin' fallin'
Fallin' fallin' fallin'
Fallin' fallin' fallin' You could be my silver spring....
Blue-green..colors flashin'
I would be your only dream.....
Your shinin' on ocean crashin'....
And did you say that she's pretty....
and did you say that she loves you...?
Baby I don't wanna know. I'll begin not to love you...
Turn around, you'll see me runnin'
I'll say I loved you years ago...
And tell myself you never loved me....No......
And did you say she was pretty....
And did you say that she loves you...?
Baby, I don't wanna know....Oh no.....
And can you tell me...was it worth it....?
Really, I don't wanna know.. Time cast a spell on you...that you won't forget me...
I know I could have loved you but you would not let me.... Time cast a spell on you...that you won't forget me...
(I was such a fool)
I know I could've loved you, but you would not let me..
(Give me one more chance)
I'll follow you down 'til the sound of my voice will haunt you..
(Haunt you)
You'll never get away from the sound of the woman that loves you.. Rock on gold dust woman
Take your silver spoon
Dig your grave Heartless challenge
Pick your path and I'll pray Wake up in the morning
See your sunrise loves to go down
Lousy lovers pick their prey
But they never cry out loud
Cry out Did she make you cry
Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love
And is it over now do you know how
Pick up the pieces and go home. Rock on ancient queen
Follow those who pale
In your shadow Rulers make bad lovers
You better put your kingdom up for sale
Up for sale Well did she make you cry
Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love
And is it over now, do you know how
Pickup the pieces and go home. Well did she make you cry
Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love
And now tell me
Is it over now, do you know how
Pickup the pieces and go home
Go home
Go home Pale

Woman, woman Why don't you ask him if he's going to stay?
Why don't you ask him if he's going away?
Why don't you tell me what's going on?
Why don't you tell me who's on the phone? Why don't you ask him what's going on?
Why don't you ask him who's the latest on his throne?
Don't say that you love me!
Just tell me that you want me! Tusk!
Just say that you want me
Just tell me that you Tusk!
Tusk!
Tusk! Sweet wonderful you
You make me happy with the things you do
Oh, can it be so
This feeling follows me wherever I go I never did believe in miracles
But I've a feeling it's time to try
I never did believe in the ways of magic
But I'm beginning to wonder why I never did believe in miracles
But I've a feeling it's time to try
I never did believe in the ways of magic
But I'm beginning to wonder why Don't, don't break the spell
It would be different and you know it will
You, you make loving fun
And I don't have to tell you but you're the only one You, you make loving fun
It's all I want to do
You, you make loving fun
It's all I want to do
You, you make loving fun
It's all I want to do
You, you make loving fun
It's all I want to do Need someone's hand to lead me through the night
I need someone's arms to hold and squeeze me tight
Now, when the night begins, I'm at an end
Because I need your love so bad I need some lips to feel next to mine
Need someone to stand up and tell me when I'm lyin'
And when the lights are low, and it's time to go
That's when I need your love so bad So why don't you give it up - and bring it home to me
Or write it on a piece of paper, baby - so it can be read to me Tell me that you love me, and stop drivin' me mad
Ooh, because I, I need your love so bad Need your soft voice, that talked to me at night
I don't want you to worry, baby
I know we can make everything alright
Listen to my plea, baby, bring it to me
Because I need your love so bad Sometimes, the most beautiful things,
The most innocent things.
And many of those dreams, pass us by.
Keep passing me by. You feel good,
I said it's funny that you understood.
I knew you would
When you were good, you were very, very good. So I close my eyes softly,
'Til I become that part of the wind
That we all long for sometime, yeah.
And to those that I love, like a ghost through a fog
Like a charmed hour and a haunted song,
And the angel of my dreams.
Angel of my dreams. (You said) You feel good,
I said it's funny that you understood.
I knew you would
When you were good, baby,
You were very good. I still look up, when you walk in the room.
I've the same wide eyes, now they tell the story.
I try not to reach out, when you turn 'round you say hello.
And we both pretend,
I'm no great pretender. So I close my eyes softly,
'till I become that part of the wind
That we all long for sometime.
And to those that I love, like a ghost through a fog
Like a charmed hour and a haunted song
And the angel, angel of my dreams Angel of my dreams I still look up I try hard not to look up, yeah That girl was me, yeah Track a ghost through the fog, yeah A charmed hour and a haunted song Track a ghost through the fog, baby Ooh, you try hard
But you'll never catch me, yeah So long ago
Certain place
Certain time
You touched my hand
All the way
All the way down to Emmiline
But if our paths never cross
Well you know I'm sorry but
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
The rainbow's end So it's hard to find
Someone with that kind of intensity
You touched my hand I played it cool
And you reached out your hand for me
But if our paths never cross
Well you know I'm sorry but
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
The rainbow's end So long ago
It's a certain time
It's a certain place
You touched my hand and you smiled
All the way back you held out your hand
If I hope and I pray
Ooh it might work out someday
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again If I could turn the page
In time then I'd rearrange
Just a day or two
Close my, close my, close my eyes But I couldn't find a way
So I'll settle for one day
To believe in you
Tell me, tell me , tell me lies Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
(Tell me lies, tell me, tell me lies)
Oh, no, no you can't disguise
(You can't disguise, no you can't disguise)
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies Although I'm not making plans
I hope that you understand
There's a reason why
Close your, close your, close your eyes No more broken hearts
We're better off apart
Let's give it a try
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
(Tell me lies, tell me, tell me lies)
Oh, no, no you can't disguise
(You can't disguise, no you can't disguise)
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies If I could turn the page
In time then I'd rearrange
Just a day or two
Close my, close my, close my eyes But I couldn't find a way
So I'll settle for one day
To believe in you
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
(Tell me lies, tell me, tell me lies)
Oh, no, no you can't disguise
(You can't disguise, no you can't diguise) Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
(Tell me lies, tell me, tell me lies)
Oh, no, no you can't disguise
(You can't disguise, no you can't disguise)
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
(Tell me, tell me lies) [instrumental] I know there's nothing to say
Someone has taken my place
When times go bad
When times go rough
Won't you lay me down in tall grass
And let me do my stuff I know I got nothin' on you
I know there's nothing to do
When times go bad
And you can't get enough
Won't you lay me down in the tall grass
And let me do my stuff One thing I think you should know
I ain't gonna miss you when you go
Been down so long
I've been tossed around enough
Awh couldn't you just
Let me go down and do my stuff I know you're hopin' to find
Someone who's gonna give you piece of mind
When times go bad
When times go rough
Won't you lay me down in tall grass
And let me do my stuff I'm just second hand news
I'm just second hand news yeah
I'm just second hand news
I'm just second hand news yeah
I'm just second hand news
I'm just second hand news yeah
I'm just second hand news
I'm just second hand news yeah, yeah
Yeah She broke down and let me in
Made me see where I've been Been down one time
Been down two times
I'm never going back again You don't know what it means to win
Come down and see me again Been down one time
Been down two times
I'm never going back again Can you understand me
Baby don't you hand me a line
Although it doesn't matter
You and me got plenty of time There's nobody in the future
So baby let me hand you my love
Oh, there's no step for you to dance to
So slip your hand inside of my glove Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me I don't want no damage
But how am I gonna manage with you
You hold the percentage
But I'm the fool payin' the dues I'm just around the corner
If you got a minute to spare
I'll be waitin' for ya'
If you ever want to be there Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me I can't help about the shape I'm in
I can't sing, I ain't pretty and my legs are thin
But don't ask me what I think of you
I might not give the answer that you want me to Now, when I talked to God, I knew He'd understand
He said, "Stick by my side and I'll be your guiding hand
But don't ask me what I think of you
I might not give the answer that you want me to"
Ooh, well Every night that goes between
I feel a little less
As you slowly go away from me
This is only another test Every day you do not come
Your softness fades away
Did I ever really care that much
Is there anything left to say [Chorus]
Every hour of fear I spend
My body tries to cry
Living through each empty night
A deadly call inside I haven't felt this way I feel
Since many a years ago
But in those years and the lifetimes past
I did not deal with the road
And I did not deal with you I know
Though the love has always been
So I search to find an answer there
So I can truly win [Chorus] So I try to say good-bye my friend
Id like to leave you with something more
But never ever been a blue calm sea
I have always been a storm Always been a storm Oh always been a storm I have always been a storm We were frail
She said "every night he will break your heart"
I should've known from the first
Id be the broken-hearted
But I loved you from the start
Not all the prayers in the world could save us I don't want to know the reasons why
Love keeps right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine I don't want to know the reasons why
Love keeps right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine Finally baby
The truth has come down now
Take a listen to your spirit
It's crying out loud.
Tryin' to believe
Oh you say you love me, but you don't know
You got me rocking and a-reeling
Oh oh yeah uh huh I don't want to know the reasons why
Love keeps right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine I don't want to know the reasons why
Love keeps right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine Finally baby
The truth has been told
Now you tell me that I'm crazy
It's nothing that I didn't know
Trying to survive
Oh you say you love me, but you don't know
You got me rocking and a-reeling
Hey I want you oh oh yeah uh huh I don't want to know the reasons why
Love keeps right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, take a little time. Oh I don't want to know When I see you again
Will it be the same
When I see you again
Will it be over
When I see you again
Will your great eyes still say [Chorus]
What's the matter, baby
What's the matter, baby
What's the matter, baby, baby, baby
What's the matter, baby
What's the matter, baby
What's the matter, baby, baby So she walks slowly down the hall
There are many doors in the hallway
And she stares at the stairs
Ooh there are many things to stare at these days
If she sees him again
Will your very best friend
Will your very best friend
Oh, have been replaced by some other [Chorus] And the dream says I want you
And the dream is gone
So she stays up night on end
Well at least there is a dream left If I see you again
Will it be over
If I see you again
Will it be the same
If I see you again
Will it be over
Again and again
Over and over Looking out for love
In the night so still
Oh I'll build you a kingdom
In that house on the hill
Looking out for love
Big, big love You said that you love me
And that you always will
Oh you begged me to keep you
In that house on the hill
Looking out for love
Big, big love I wake up alone
With it all
I wake up
But only to fall Looking out for love
Big, big love
Just looking out for love
Big, big love Don't look for no worries, worries and troubles come around
Yes, I don't look for no worries, people, worries and troubles come around
The world keep on turning, I got to keep my feet on the ground
Nobody saw me cryin' - nobody knows the way I feel
Nobody saw me cryin' - nobody knows the way I feel
Yeah, the way I love the woman, it's bound to get me killed
I loved the little girl so good, she made my low down butter come
Loved the little girl so good, she made my low down butter come
I need the woman so bad, I need her like the sky needs the sun When I see you again
Will it be the same
When I see you again
Will it be over
When I see you again
Will your great eyes still say [Chorus]
What's the matter, baby
What's the matter, baby
What's the matter, baby, baby, baby
What's the matter, baby
What's the matter, baby
What's the matter, baby, baby So she walks slowly down the hall
There are many doors in the hallway
And she stares at the stairs
Ooh there are many things to stare at these days
If she sees him again
Will your very best friend
Will your very best friend
Oh, have been replaced by some other [Chorus] And the dream says I want you
And the dream is gone
So she stays up night on end
Well at least there is a dream left If I see you again
Will it be over
If I see you again
Will it be the same
If I see you again
Will it be over
Again and again
Over and over All it took was a special look
And I felt I knew you before
I didn't mean to love you
Didn't think it would work out But I knew we would be together
And I couldn't wait for more
But what can they say
It's not against the law I don't hold you down
Maybe that's why you're around
But if I'm the one you love
Well think about me I believe that you really want me
But it's not easy, just to give in
So let yourself go and let love begin I don't hold you down
Maybe that's why you're around
But if I'm the one you love
Well think about me I don't hold you down
Maybe that's why you're around
But if I'm the one you love
Well think about me Baby, once in a while
Now think about me
Baby, once in a while
Think about me Baby, once in a while
Don't you think about me
Every, every once in a while
Think about me I been alone
All the years
So many ways to count the tears
I never change
I never will
I'm so afraid the way I feel Days when the rain and the sun are gone
Black as night
Agony's torn at my heart too long
So afraid
Slip and I fall and I die I been alone
Always down
No one cared to stay around
I never change
I never will
I'm so afraid the way I feel Days when the rain and the sun are gone
Black as night
Agony's torn at my heart too long
So afraid
Slip and I fall and I die You can take me to paradise,
And then again you can be as cold ice.
I'm over my head,
Oh but it sure feels nice. You can take me anytime you like,
I'll be around if you think you might love me baby,
And hold me tight. Your mood is like a circus wheel,
You're changing all the time,
Sometimes I can't help but feel,
That I'm wasting all of my time. Your mood is like a circus wheel,
You're changing all the time,
Sometimes I can't help but feel,
That I'm wasting all of my time. Think I'm looking on the dark side,
But everyday you hurt my pride,
I'm over my head,
Oh but it sure feels nice,
I'm over my head,
But it sure feels nice.
I'm over my head,
But it sure feels nice. You could be my silver springs
Blue-green colors flashing
I would be your only dream
Your shining on an ocean crashing And did you say she was pretty
And did you say that she loves you
Baby I don't want to know I begin not to love you
Turn around, see me running
I say I loved you years ago
But tell myself you never loved me no And did you say she was pretty
And did you say that she loves you
Baby I don't want to know Oh no And can you tell me was it worth it
Really, I don't want to know Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me I'll follow you down 'till the sound
Of my voice will haunt you You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loves you I'll follow you down 'till the sound
Of my voice will haunt you

You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loves you
(Was I just a fool)
I'll follow you down till the sound of my voice will haunt you
(give me just a chance)
you'll never get away from the sound of the woman that loves you
(never get away never get away never get away)
You could be my silver springs my blue green colors flashing Step into the velvet of the morning
Let yourself lay back within your dreams
Take on the situation but not the torment
Now you know it's not as bad as it seems Well, I know you'd like to come away
But, baby, you can't come
Fortune is your life's love Oh, and anytime you think about leaving
Think about what you know
Well, think about it
Think about it before you go Even when you feel like your life is fading
I know that you'll go on forever, you're that good
Heartbreak of the moment is not endless
Fortune is your life's love Well, honey I know you'd like to come away
But, baby, you can't come
Fortune is your life's love Oh, and anytime you think about leaving

And the heart says whatever

I'm wastin' my time by goin' to school
The way you got me holdin' your door I can't do my homework anymore
I can't do my homework anymore
Oh baby, I said you got me so blind
I'm walkin' 'round in circles, I could loose my mind The way you got me holdin' your door

Now baby your as sweet as you can be
Everything you do keep on sending me
Just the kiss of your lips or the touch of your hand Everything you do is really grand

I can't do my homework anymore
I can't do my homework anymore At the end of the day
The end of the light
She keeps the remains of all of her foes
Miranda is dying with all of her might
She never comes
She always goes She sticks the camera right into her arm
Anything to forget what the trouble's about
It causes her pain,
That's part of the charm
She's down for the count then finally out Miranda is taking the stars down
A little something to call her own
But the lion still rules Miranda
And Miranda is always alone She sees her face in another magazine
And the walls all close in as the fancy takes flight
Can't stand to be loved,
But she loves to be seen
She slips down headlong into the night Miranda is taking the stars down
A little something to call her own
But the lion still rules Miranda
And Miranda is always alone And then all at once the sun starts to rise
She sees her father holding her down
All the daylight is poison to her eyes
She slips down the shade and lets herself drown Miranda is taking the stars down
A little something to call her own
But the lion still rules Miranda
And Miranda is always alone The lights shine down the marina
All across her safety zone
But loneliness follows Miranda
And Miranda is always alone
Miranda is always alone
Miranda is always alone Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... So you face yesterday
Thinking on the days of old
And the price that we paid
For a love we couldn't hold I let you slip away
There was nothing I could do
That was so long ago, yeah
Still I often think of you I fall down, I get up
And I've always had to fight
Everything that was wrong
For the things that were right Now I finally found my way
Now I know just what to do
Once you said goodbye to me, yeah
Now I say goodbye to you It's so hard to find your way
When the lies come around
Still it happens everyday
So don't let it get you down Just a time within a time
Just a scheme within a scheme
A little world within a world
Yes, a dream, just a dream Now I finally found my way
Now I know just what to do
Once you said goodbye to me, yeah
Now I say goodbye to you Now I best be on my way
Before the night turns blue
Once you said goodbye to me, yeah
And now I say goodbye to you
Once you said goodbye to me, yeah
Now I say goodbye to you What can you say?
There isn't much to tell.
I'm going downhill
And I blame myself.
I've been jumpin' at shadows,
Thinking 'bout my life. Everybody points their hand at me.
I know I'm just a picture
Of what I should've been.
I've been jumpin' at shadows,
Thinking 'bout my life. God have mercy.
I think I'm going insane.
The Devil's been gettin' at me
He's got me down again.
Got me jumping at shadows,
Just thinking about my life Beautiful child
Beautiful child
You are a beautiful child
And I am a fool once more You fell in love when I was only ten
The years disappeared
Much has gone by since then
I bite my lip, can you send me away
You touch
I have no choice
I have to stay
Ooh, I had to stay
Ooh, I had to stay Sleepless child
There is so little time
Your eyes say yes
But you don't say yes
I wish that you were mine
I wish that you were mine You say it will be harder in the morning
I wait for you to say, just go
Your hands held mine so few hours
(I fell into love)
And I'm not a child anymore I'm not a child anymore
I'm tall enough
To reach for the stars
I'm old enough
To love you from afar
Too trusting? Yes
But then women usually are I'm not a child anymore
No, I'm not a child, oh no
Tall enough to reach for the stars
I will do
As I'm told
Even if I never hold you again
I never hold you again Sleepless child
There is so little time
Your eyes say yes, but you don't say yes
I wish that you were mine (x4) My baby's gone and left me - crying by myself
My baby's gone and left me - crying by myself
I loved another woman - I lost my best gal She was a real good woman - she didn't me no harm
She was a real good woman - she wouldn't do me no harm
But I loved another woman - now she's up and she's gone Well, come back baby - I know I treated you wrong
Well, come back baby - I know I treated you wrong
I loved another woman - now, I won't do that no more I've been searching
For a pot of gold
Like the kind you find
At the end of the rainbow I've been dreaming
Thought it was in vain
Ah, But now you're here
Can't believe that you're back again Now I know I can't lose
As long as you follow
I'm gonna win
I'm gonna beg, steal, or borrow
As Long as you follow I've been wandering
Gone away too far
But the road was rough
To get back where you are And the sun went down
Never seem to rise
Ah, but now you're here
With the light shining in your eyes Now I know I can't lose
As long as you follow
I'm gonna win
I'm gonna beg, steal, or borrow Yes, I can live today
If you give me tomorrow
As long as you follow Now I know I can't lose
As long as you follow
I'm gonna win
I'm gonna beg, steal, or borrow Yes, I can live today
If you give me tomorrow
As long as you follow It's the same kind of story
That seems to come down from long ago
Two friends having coffee together
When something flies by their window
It might be out on that lawn
Which is wide, at least half of a playing field
Because there's no explaining what your imagination
Can make you see and feel Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Now it's not a meaningless question
To ask if they've been and gone
I remember a talk about North
Carolina and a strange, strange pond
You see the sides were like glass
In the thick of a forest without a road
And if any man's ever made that land
Then I think it would've showed
Seems like a dream They got me hypnotized
They say there's a place down in Mexico
Where a man can fly over mountains and hills
And he don't need an airplane or some kind of engine
And he never will
Now you know it's a meaningless question
To ask if those stories are right
'Cause what matters most if the feeling
You get when you're hypnotized
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized We make all of our suns the same
Every one will suffer the fire we've made
They all explode just the same
And there's no going back on the plans we've made Peacekeeper, take your time
Wait for the dark of night
Soon all the suns will rise
Peacekeeper, don't tell why
Don't be afraid to fight
Love is the sweet surprise Only creatures who are on their way
Ever poison their own well
But we still have time to hate
And there's still something we can sell Peacekeeper, take your time
Wait for the dark of night
Soon all the suns will rise
Peacekeeper, don't tell why
Don't be afraid to fight
Love is the sweet surprise When the night is cold and still
When you thought you'd had your fill
Take all the time you will
This is not a test, it's not a drill
Take no prisoners, only kill You know all of our friends are Gods
And they all tell us how to paint our face
But there's only one brush we need
It's the one that never leaves a trace Peacekeeper, take your time
Wait for the dark of night
Soon all the suns will rise
Peacekeeper, don't tell why
Don't be afraid to fight
Love is the sweet surprise Peacekeeper, take your time
Wait for the dark of night
Soon all the suns will rise
Peacekeeper, don't tell why
Don't be afraid to fight
Love is the sweet surprise When the night is cold and still
When you thought you'd had your fill
This is not a test, it's not a drill
Take no prisoners, only kill Don't take me to the tower
And take my child away
It was I who was
The hourglass
And the sands of time like
Shattering glass went past me
Like a tunnel to the sea And I who went to sleep as two
Woke up as one now only you remain
You'll close your eyes and travel back
To the time when the light went fading fast
And the words you'll never, never forget, oh no
As you slipped away Goodbye baby
I hope your heart's not broken
Don't forget me
Yes I was outspoken
You were with me all the time
I'll be with you one day And I who went to sleep in tears
Woke up in tears, for all of the years
And I who never, never said goodbye
As I slipped away Goodbye baby
I hope your heart's not broken
Don't forget me
Yes I was outspoken
You were with me all the time
I'll be with you one day Goodbye baby
I hope your heart's not broken
Don't forget me
Yes I was outspoken
You were with me all the time
I'll be with you one day Yes, I'll be with you one day Something in you brought out something in me
That I've never been since
That part of me that was only for you
That kind of romance
Comes only once, that kind of love
That kind of fever dance
That you love because you've become someone else
In an instant Say you will, say you will give me one more chance
At least give me time to change your mind
That always seems to heal the wounds
If I can get you to dance Something in you put a hold on my heart
It's hard to believe now
Here is a place that will never be dark
I remember that place
That kind of touch, electricity of love
That certain kind of grace
That you love because you become someone else
In an instant Say you will, say you will give me one more chance
At least give me time to change your mind
That always seems to heal the wounds
If I can get you to dance Say you will, say you will give me one more chance
(Say you will)
At least give me time to change your mind
(Say you will)
That always seems to heal the wounds
If I can get you to dance Say you will, say you will give me one more chance
(Say you will)
At least give me time to change your mind
(Say you will)
That always seems to heal the wounds
If I can get you to dance Say you will, say you will give me one more chance
At least give me time to change your mind
That always seems to heal the wounds
If I can get you to dance Say you will, say you will give me one more chance
At least give me time to change your mind
That always seems to heal the wounds
If I can get you to dance Say you will, say you will give me one more chance
At least give me time to change your mind
That always seems to heal the wounds
If I can get you to dance There's distance between us
And you're on my mind
As I lay here in the darkness
I can find no peace inside
I wish you were here holding me tight
If I had you near it would make it alright
I wish you were here
'Cause I feel like a child tonight Rain on my window
I can count the drops
But I can't help feeling lonely
There's no way I can stop
I wish you were here holding me tight
If I had you near it would make it alright
I wish you were here
'Cause I feel like a child tonight Each moment is a memory
Time is so unkind
Every hour, filled with an emptiness I can't hide
There's distance between us
And you're on my mind
As I lay here in the darkness
I can find no peace inside
I wish you were here holding me tight
If I had you near it would make it alright
I wish you were here
'Cause I feel like a child tonight Sleep easy by my side
Into gentle slumber you can hide
I, I'm waiting for the sun, to come up
I can't sleep, with your warm ways Forever
Forever love
Together
Together love You made me a woman tonight
Sleep until the morning light
I, I'm waiting for the sun, to come up
I can't sleep, with your warm way Forever
Forever love
Together
Together love Shall I tell you about my life
They say I'm a man of the world
I've flown across every tide
And I've seen lots of pretty girls I guess I've got everything I need
I wouldn't ask for more
And there's no one I'd rather be
But I just wish that I'd never been born And I need a good woman
to make me feel like a good man should
I don't say I'm a good man
Oh, but I would be if I could I could tell you about my life
And keep you amused I'm sure
About all the times I've cried
And how I don't want to be sad anymore
And how I wish I was in love Oh no
Here I go again
Fallin' in love again.
Love is like a grain of sand
Slowly slippin' through your hand.
Oh
Oh Diane
Oh
Oh Diane.
Will I love you
I will
Always.
Will you stand by me always?
'Cause love is like a grain of sand . . .
Talkin' 'bout Diane
Oh
Oh Diane.
Oh
Oh Diane
Oh
Oh Diane.
Talkin' 'bout Diane
Oh
Oh Diane. Monday morning you sure look fine

No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind When the white flame in us is gone
And we that lost the world's delight
Stiffen in darkness.
Left alone
To crumble in our separate light
When your swift hair is quiet in death
And through the lips corruption
Thrust to still the labor of my breath When we are dust, when we are dust
When we are dust, when we are dust When your swift hair is quiet in death
And through the lips corruption
Thrust to still the labor of my breath When we are dust, when we are dust
When we are dust, when we are dust When the white flame in us is gone
And we that lost the world's delight
Stiffen in darkness
Left alone
To crumble in our separate light
When your swift hair is quiet in death
And through the lips corruption
Thrust to still the labor of my breath When we are dust, when we are dust
When we are dust, when we are dust I got a black magic woman
Got a black magic woman
Yes, I got a black magic woman
Got me so blind I can't see
But she's a black magic woman
And she's tryin' to make a devil out of me Don't turn your back on me baby
Don't turn your back on me baby
Yes, don't turn your back on me baby
You're messin' around with your tricks
Don't turn your back on me baby
'Cause you might just break up my magic stick You got your spell on me baby

Turning my heart into stone

Yeah, I need you darling
Yes, I want you to love me
I want you to love me
Whoa, I want you to love me, ah
Whoa, yeah
Oh, whoa, baby
Yes, I need your love Walk down this road
When the road gets rough
I fall down
I get up
I am what I am
A family man
I am what I am
A family man
Mother, father, brother
Mother, father, brother
Walk down this road
In the cool of the night
Don't know what's wrong
But I do know what's right
I am what I am
A family man
I am what I am
A family man
Mother, father, brother
Mother, father, brother
I am what I am
A family man
I am what I am
A family man
Mother, father, brother
Mother, father, brother I'm out of my mind
And it's only over you
I'm out of my mind
And it's only over you
People think I'm crazy But they don't know
Thought love had failed me
But now, they're watching it grow
Angel, please don't go
I miss you when you're gone
They say I'm a silly girl But I'm not a fool
People say they know me
But they don't see
My heart's your future
Your future is me
Angel, please don't go
I miss you when you're gone
They say I'm a silly girl But I'm not a fool
I'm out of my mind
And it's only over you
I'm out of my mind
And it's only over you Intense silence
As she walked in the room
Her black robes trailing
Sister of the moon And a black widow spider makes
More sound than she
And black moons in those eyes of hers
Made more sense to me Heavy persuasion
It was hard to breathe
She was dark at the top of the stairs
And she called to me And so I followed as friends often do
I cared not for love nor money
And I think she knew
Well, the people, they love her
And still they are the most cruel She asked me, "Be my sister
Sister, sister of the moon" Some call her sister of the moon
Some say, illusions are her game
They like to wrap her in velvet
Does anyone, ooh, know her name? Do you always trust your first initial feeling
Special knowledge holds true, bear believing I turned around and the water was closing all around like a glove
Like the love that finally found me.
Then I knew in the crystaline knowledge of you
Drove me through the mountains
Through the crystal like and clear water fountain
Drove me like a magnet
To the sea
To the sea How the faces of love have changed turning the pages
And I have changed, oh, but you, you remain ageless I turned around and the water was closing all around like a glove
Like the love that finally found me.
Then I knew in the crystaline knowledge of you
Drove me though the mountains
Through the crystal like and clear water fountain
Drove me like a magnet
To the sea
To the sea Don't let waters of caution remove you
Don't let the fire of saints compel you
Don't let the lack of their spirit blind your life
'Cause soon it's all over, you're gonna come through alive Well I've been all over the world five times or more
And I've seen the future burn blue before my eyes
And all through the dust and the green magnesium fire
Don't let the violence blind you, you're gonna come through alive And the roses that are offing
They are real as evening wind
They are washed by love and suffering
'Cause my love has colored them, colored them
Nothing but roses Don't dam the river that's running through you
Stop saving up for time that may never become
I've seen the future come true in twenty days
But don't let is scare you, stop thinking about yesterday I've had my share of blue revelations
And I know that time is a region to be passed
So all through the dust and green magnesium fire
I can rest easy now, and watch the carnival rolling by 'Cause a rose that will be growing
In the place where I have hidden
It is washed by love and suffering
That my love has colored in Look where the roses grow
Look where the roses grow
Look where the roses
... When you squeeze me baby
You make me hollar whoa whoa whoa
When you squeeze me baby
You make me hollar whoa whoa whoa

When everything is going bad
Think of me, sweet darlin'
Every time you're feeling sad
Think of me, sweet darlin'
Every time you don't come
Can you feel the fever? Think of me, sweet darlin'
Every time things get rough
Think of me, sweet darlin'
When the best just isn't enough
Think of me, sweet darlin'
Every time you don't come
Can you feel the fever? 'Cause nobody else is doing it, whoa
And nobody else is doing it, no no
Where's the harmony? Where's the humanity?
Love, was a little too scarce
Hey, hey, ooh yeah I said I was going before it got away
She's been here a while
Living in the guest room
I guess she goes in style
I said I was going before it got away
But I just can't let her go
Can you feel the fever? Now I lay me down to sleep in this enemy bed
Tomorrow morning I will wake up
Hurting from the things we've said
One thing leads to another
But I guess you know about that
Can you feel the fever? 'Cause nobody else is doing it, whoa
And nobody else is doing it, no
Where's the harmony? Where's the humanity?
Love, was a little too scarce
Hey, hey, ooh, yeah 'Cause nobody else is doing it, yeah
No, nobody else is doing it, doing it, are they now, now, now?
Where's the harmony? Where's the new harmony?
Love, it was a little too scarce
Hey, hey, ooh, yeah
Take it! Think of me sweet darlin'
Every time you don't come You are here and warm
But I could look away and you'd be gone
Cause we live in a time
When meaning falls in splinters from our lives
And that's why I've traveled far
'Cause I come so together where you are And all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you
14 joys and a will to be merry
And all of the things that we say are very
Sentimental gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental Lady
Gentle one Now you are here today
But easily you might just go away
Cause we live in a time
When paintings have no color, words don't rhyme
And that's why I've traveled far
'Cause I come so together where you are And all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you
14 joys and a will to be merry
And all of the things that we say are very
Sentimental gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental Lady
Gentle one You are here and warm
But I could look away and you'd be gone
'Cause we live in a time
When meaning falls in splinters from our lives
And that's why I've traveled far
'Cause I come so together where you are Yes and all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you
14 joys and a will to be merry
And all of the things that we say are very
Sentimental gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental Lady
Gentle one Sentimental gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental Lady
Gentle one Sentimental gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental Lady
Gentle one What can I say this time
Which card shall I play
The dream is not over,
The dream is just away
And you will fly
Like some little wing
Straight back to the sun
The dream was never over
The dream has just begun
The dream has just begun Fingers find the ivory keys
And a song begins to begin
Like a wolf on the run
And you will find
While in the wind
Something that you lost
The dream was never over, no
The dream was only lost (Hours and hours of waiting for you,
So strong and so fleeting)
The dream has just begun
(And hours of waiting for you
In hopes of meeting)
The dream has just begun
(This way)
Well, the dream has just begun She remembers how good it can be
He remembers a melody
Ah, in the shadow of my shadow
In a gleam
He remembers how good it can be
She remembers a melody
Well, in the shadow of my shadow
In a gleam
(Hours and hours of waiting for you
So strong and so fleeting)
The dream has just begun
(Hours and hours of waiting this way
Meeting, me)
Hours of waiting for you
(So strong and so fleeting)
The dream has just begun
(Meeting this way)
Straight back now
(Hours and hours of waiting
So strong and so fleeting)
Hours and hours waiting this way
Hours and hours of waiting this way
Straight back
Straight back
Straight back, yeah! He remembers a melody
He remembers how good it can be One more lonely night
Just one more lonely night
She doesn't like sleeping alone You may come home one morning
And find she's not sleeping alone
Oh, then baby you'll see
Oh yes, you should have stayed at home
Because One more lonely night
Just one more lonely night
She doesn't like sleeping alone
Just one more lonely night
Just one more lonely night
Oh, wouldn't you like to be the one
Holding her tight If you want her, better get her now
Or she'll be running away somehow
Oh, it's not for me to say
If she'll be happy some other way
Because One more lonely night
Just one more lonely night
She doesn't like sleeping alone
Oh, One more lonely night
Just one more lonely night
Oh, wouldn't you like to be the one
Holding her tight
Don't be a fool Just one more lonely night
Oh, One lonely night
Wouldn't you like to be the one
Holding her tight
Don't be a fool Just one more lonely night
Just one more lonely night
Oh, wouldn't you like to be the one
Holding her tight Would you love me tomorrow
Like you say you love me now
Would you love me, would you love me tomorrow
Like you say you love me now
When the flames of our flesh have stopped burning
And the fire of our love has cooled down Too many times I've given too much
Baby, give me your love to me in return
Too many times I've given too much
Baby, give me your love in return
Give me your mind and your heart
Oh, but please don't leave me with a love that burns And don't you use me as your fool
Baby, 'cause my heart can't stand another lie
Woman never use me, don't use me as your fool
Baby, 'cause my heart can't stand another lie
And if you can't love me tomorrow
Please leave me now in my room to cry She's so crazy
She's so lazy
Keeps on coming
Keeps you running Caroline
Caroline
Time recedes
With a fatal drop
Dusty fury
On the mountain top
Cut the cord if you can
Caroline
Caroline She's so cagey
She's so stagey
So attractive
So reactive Caroline
Caroline
Time recedes
With a fatal drop
Dusty fury
On the mountain top
Cut the cord if you can
Caroline
Caroline Caroline
Caroline
Time recedes
With a fatal drop
Dusty fury
On the mountain top
Cut the cord if you can
Caroline
Caroline
Caroline
Caroline And when the roses are half-bud soft flowers
And lovely as the king of flies has come
It was a fleeting visit, all too brief
In three short minutes, he had been and gone He rested there upon an apple leaf
A gorgeous opal crown sat on his head
Although the garden is a lovely place
Was it worthy of so fine a guest Oh...
Oh...
Oh...
Oh... Dragonfly, dragonfly ... So many nights I lay awake
Can't sleep
I lay here thinkin' 'bout a woman
I used to love
Can't sleep but no good to count sheep
I'll just count the worries
That I've got plenty of And how many times
Must I be the fool
Before I can make it
Oh make it on home
I've got to find a place to sing my words
Is there nobody listening to my song? You talk about a life
Been searching for the key
But can't find an answer
To comfort me
I ask myself about love
Can't even find the door
To take me to a place
I've never seen before But how many times
Must I be the fool
Before I can make it
Oh make it on home
I've got to find a place to sing my words
Is there nobody listening to my song? Well I need a sugar daddy,
He could be my friend,
And if I needed money,
I know he would lend me a hand, But when it comes to loving,
He'd better leave me alone,
'Cause I've got you baby,
And you give me all the love I need,
Yes you give me all the love I need And when I get a little hungry
He could give me all I could eat,
And if I needed whisky,
He could serve it to me neat. But when it comes to loving,
He'd better leave me alone,
'Cause I've got you baby,
And you give me all the love I need,
Yes you give me all the love I need All that I want is someone to take care of me,
I'm not asking for love,
Just a little sympathy. And he could pick me up,
In a big fancy car,
Then I could pretend
I was a big movie star. But when it comes to loving,
He'd better leave me alone,
'Cause I've got you baby,
And you give me all the love I need,
Yes you give me all the love I need All that I want is someone to take care of me,
I'm not asking for love,
Just a little sympathy. I'm not asking for love I'm not asking for love Tonight there's thunder in the sky
Just like the night you said goodbye
And what's left of a heartache
Runs like rain from my eyes [Chorus]
The winds of change
Gonna blow it all away
Ain't it strange
How you won't matter
The winds of change
Gonna blow it all away I stood like a rock against the storm
And you never knew, did you, how I was torn
And if your memory finally leaves me too
Well I won't sit and mourn [Chorus] I should of known better than to love you
I should of known that you were the hurting kind
Now I'm so tired of thinking of you
I just want to forget that you were ever mine Tonight there's shadows on my face
Every one tells a story of your disgrace
But soon the dawn will come
And I'll be gone without a trace [Chorus] Ain't it strange
How you won't matter I'm crazy for my baby
But my baby she don't love me I'm so lonely babe
I'm so lonely babe
No I can't live without you babe
I'm so lonely babe I woke up last night
I found she was gone
I woke up last night
Found she was gone I'm so lonely babe
I'm so lonely babe
No I can't live without you babe
I'm so lonely babe I woke up last night
Found she was gone
I woke up last night
I found she was gone I'm so lonely babe
I'm so lonely babe
No I can't live without you babe
I'm so lonely babe It was a blue letter
She wrote to me
It's silver words she told
want to be on the road to paradise
I want to lover who don't get old. Do I read a message in your eyes
You want to love to stay another night
Baby when your day goes down
I won't be waitin' around for you. For every voice you've ever heard
There's a thousand without a word
Redbird, don't say you told me so
Just give me one more song to go. Do I read a message in your eyes
You want to love to stay another night
Baby when you day goes down
I won't be waitin' around for you. Listen to the wind blow, watch the sun rise
Running in the shadows, damn your love, damn your lies And if, you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain) And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain) Listen to the wind blow, down comes the night
Running in the shadows, damn your love, damn your lies
Break the silence, damn the dark, damn the light And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain) And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain) And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain) Chain keep us together (running in the shadow)
Chain keep us together (running in the shadow)
Chain keep us together (running in the shadow)
Chain keep us together (running in the shadow)
Chain keep us together (running in the shadow)
Chain keep us together (running in the shadow) What's the world coming to
What they say isn't true
You can't plant no seed
Where there's only greed
I can walk anywhere
I can walk anytime
But the lone highway
Is the only way What's the world coming to
What's the world coming to
Everyone's gone to the moon
What's the world coming to Every night every day
In this house filled with shame
I can say I care
But there's no one there
There's no truth in my lies
There's no light in my eyes
And it's all I guess
That I'll ever miss What's the world coming to
What's the world coming to
Everyone's gone to the moon
What's the world coming to I can jump right off fall right into the ocean
I can come right out mean just what I say
But if I don't call for a reservation
They'll just turn me down turn me inside out I don't say what they want
I don't want what they say
So I'm on their list
So I'm gone I guess What's the world coming to
What's the world coming to
Everyone's gone to the moon
What's the world coming to Once again she steals away
Then she reaches out to kiss me
And how she takes my breath away
Pretending that she won't miss me Oh I would bleed to love her
Bleed to love her
Oh I would bleed to love her And once again she calls to me
Then she vanishes in thin air
And how she takes my breath away
Pretending that she's not there Oh I would bleed to love her
Bleed to love her
Oh I would bleed to love her Somebody's got to see this through
All the world is laughing at you
Somebody's got to sacrifice
If this whole thing's going to turn out right Oh I would bleed to love her
Bleed to love her
Oh I would bleed to love her How can my heart be filled with doubts of you
When you can fill me with a love that's true
But I can't help but sigh, and sometimes wonder why
What can I do I want to see you, know you more each day
I really need you, you're my only way
You say it's alright now but still I wonder how
What can I say I've dreamed a thousand dreams
And cried so many tears
'Cause when you're not in my heart it seems
Like I'm wasting all my years Someday together we'll fly to the sun
And then we'll think of all the things we've done
Everyone will smile, happy all the while
Now that we're one I've dreamed a thousand dreams
And cried so many tears
When you're not in my heart it seems
Like I'm wasting all my years Someday together we'll fly to the sun
And then we'll think of all the things we've done
Everyone will smile, happy all the while
Now that we're one

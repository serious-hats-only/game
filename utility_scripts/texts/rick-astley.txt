Convinced me she's fine
But when she leaves
I'm not so sure It's always the same
She's playing her game
And when she goes
I feel to blame Why won't she say
She needs me?
I know she's not
As strong as she seems Why don't I see
Her cry for help?
Why don't I feel
Her cry for help?
Why don't I hear
Her cry for help? I wandered around
The streets of this town
Trying to find sense in it all The rain on my face
It covers the trace
Of all the tears
I've had to waste Why must we hide emotions?
Why must we never break down and cry? All that I need
Is to cry for help
Somebody please hear me

Is made of stone
And this old house

In this old house

In this old house
Where I live my life
In this old house
Gonna make you my wife
This old house
Is part of me
This old house
Is where you should be Can you feel it?
Can you feel it? This old house
Is who I'll be
And this old house
Holds memories
This old house
Is gonna see me younger
This old house
This old house
Where I live my life
In this old house
Gonna make you my wife
This old house

Can you feel it? This old house
This old house
This old house
This old house This old house
Is who I'll be
And this old house
Holds memories
And this old house is gonna see me younger
And this old house When I was much younger
It used to happen every night
I had a dream about a city
Dressed in lights And there were friends of mine
I saw them time after time
But I never knew their names
And darling I swear, I saw you there
I know it sounds insane Sweet dreams of a child forgotten so easy
I needed your smile to bring it all back to me
I see all of my life as the road that brought me here
Must be, something went right, I just know when you're near This must be heaven
Have I found it, what I've been looking for?
This must be heaven
Have I finally stumbled through the door? How could I have doubted?
I guess I must have lost my place
You turned on the light and I saw my life
Reflected in your face Sweet dreams of a time forgotten so easy, oh yeah
I needed your smile to bring it all back to me
I see all of my life as the road that brought me here
Must be something went right, I just know when you're near
Oh, yeah This must be heaven
Have I found it, what I've been looking for?
This must be heaven
Have I finally stumbled through the door?
This must be heaven
And I always knew that there was something more Heaven
Heaven Come closer to me now
You fill me up, I'm overflowing
Come closer to me now
Come hold me tight and don't let go This must be heaven
Have I found it, what I've been looking for?
This must be heaven
Have I finally stumbled through the door? You fill me up now, girl
You fill me up, I'm overflowing This must be heaven
Have I found it, what I've been living for?
This must be heaven
Have I finally stumbled through the door? This must be heaven
Have I found it, what I've been looking for?
This must be heaven
And I always knew that there were something more? My heart starts breaking
when i think of making up
plans to let you go
i keep thinking maybe tomorrow
i'm gonna let you know
but when i think about leaving
i think about losing
the only love i ever knew
every time i think of you
My heart starts aching
my hands keep shaking
and you know, you know, you know
It would take a strong, strong man
to ever let you go (to ever let you go)
to ever let you go
My heart's been hurting
when i see you flirting
every night out on the floor
i keep thinking maybe tomorrow
you'l grow to love me more
but whenever we're together
i could leave you never
even though you treat me cruel
every time i look at you
My heart starts aching
my hands keep shaking
and you know, you know, you know
It would take a strong, strong man
to ever let you go (to ever let you go)
to ever let you go
I tried to resist you
when you're gone, all i ever do is miss you
anyone in love would know
anyone with half a heart
could never let you go
(instrumental)
But when i think about leaving
i think about losing
the only girl i ever loved
can't you tell me why do you hurt me
i guess some people never see
especially a fool like me
My heart starts aching
my hands keep shaking
and you know, you know, you know
It would take a strong, strong man
to ever let you go
to ever let you go (to ever let you go)
i'll never let you go Look at me, hanging on a word, every little word
Look at you, staring out the window
For a different point of view, what should we do? Nothing's changed, everything's the same
Same old same
Lie in bed, staring at the ceiling
Wish I was somewhere else instead, enough said Let's go out tonight
Can't stand to look at these four walls
Let's go out tonight I have found, I can't stand the silence
Can't you make a sound?
What is wrong? I see your body language
Telling me you think it's over, before it's over Let's go out tonight
Can't stand to look at these four walls
Let's go out tonight Let's go out tonight
I'll do anything at all
Let's go out tonight You say we've got to get away
We've outgrown this town, it's so mundane
But if you're asking me
Chance is there but were never gonna leave
Never gonna leave Let's go out tonight
Can't stand to look at these four walls
Let's go out tonight Let's go out tonight
I'll do anything at all
Let's go out tonight Let's go out tonight
Can't stand to look at these four walls
Let's go out tonight Let's go out tonight
I'll do anything at all
Let's go out tonight Reaching for my crossbow
I patiently take aim
I've got you in the crosshair
Never gonna hurt me or anybody else again
Yes you rule the world for now
You do
Yes you rule the world for now
Yes you rule the world
You and all your money
Yes you rule the world for now I'm starting with you
And then I'll take the room to pieces
To pieces

Tomorrow's headline news
You'll all know my name
Yes you rule the world for now You do
Yes you rule the world for now
Yes you rule the world You and all your money
Yes you rule the world for now I'm starting with you
And then I'll take the room to pieces
To pieces I'm starting with you
Then I'll take the room to pieces
To pieces I'll put away my crossbow
So empty all your guns Maybe there's another way
To get things done
Yes they rule the world for now
They do
Yes they rule the world for now But we can take the air
They can keep their money
Yes we rule the world for now
If we choose to I'm starting with you
And then we'll find a place where peace is
I'm starting with you
And then I'll build a place
Where peace is
Where peace is
I'll find a place where peace is Giving up on love

And I don't want you no more Astley/Fisher  Someone called me just the other day
I thought it was you, but my hopes were washed away
I picked up the telephone, it sent a shiver down my spine
I wanted to hear your voice, and talk about old times (Chorus)
Remember the days when we walked
The times that we talked for hours and hours
Remember the way it used to be, just you and me
Remember the days Think it over what I say
I know it could be just like it used to be
Do you believe it baby, do you share my point of view
You know that I mean it baby, and all you have to do is (Repeat chorus) What can I do without you, how can I live without you
The day's gonna come, when I'm on the run
So I'm begging you baby please
Remember the days (Repeat chorus) What can I do without you, how can I live without you
So come on girl I'm begging you please
Come on and talk to me The times that we walked
The days that we used to walk out in the park
Remember how it used to be
Do you remember, do you remember how good it used to be Come on girl, I said come on girl To the left, to the right, we're gonna rock all night Rick Astley We've been trying for a long time
To say what we want to say
But feelings don't come easy
To express in a simple way But we all have feelings
We all need loving
And who would be the fool to say, that if you Hold me in your arms
I won't feel better
If you hold me in your arms
We can brave this storm together We both know there's a problem
A problem that we've got to face
So put your trust in me, lover
No-one's ever gonna take your place 'Cos we all have a problem
We all have fears
But there's always got to be a way
Yes we all have feelings
We all need loving
And you would be a fool to say, that if you Hold me in your arms
I won't feel better
If you hold me in your arms
We can brave this storm together (solo) You only have to hold me
Touch me to make me feel so good
You only have to hold me
Feel me
To make me feel the way you know I should Hold me in your arms
Hold me in your arms
Hold me in your arms
Hold me in your arms
When you gonna hold me in your arms
Hold me in your arms
Hold me in your arms
Hold me in your arms
Hold me in your arms
Hold me in your arms
Hold me in your arms
Hold me in your arms
Hold me in your arms On the empty streets of this nowhere town
The melting shadows fade
And the dark is creeping up on me again
In between these sheets where I laid you down,
I tried to find some rest
So I reach out for the switch, but why pretend? Cause I can't turn the lights out, now
I'll see your face
No, I can't turn the lights out, now
My heart will break
Cause everything I see,
Will end up killing me,
All over, all over again
So I can't turn the lights out
Turn the lights out
(Turn the lights out) There's a clock that stopped tickin' by the bed
The second you were gone
And it feels just like my heart stopped beating too
Cause it's hard to keep those promises,
I made when I was strong
Now I'm haunted by the ghost of you And I can't turn the lights out, now
I'll see your face
No, I can't turn the lights out, now
My heart will break
Cause everything I see,
Will end up killing me,
All over, all over again
No, I can't turn the lights out
Turn the lights out
(Turn the lights out) It's so hard holdin' on
It's so hard letting go
It's so hard holdin' on
Don't you know? Don't you know? I can't turn the lights out, now
I'll see your face
I can't turn the lights out, now
My heart will break
Cause everything I see,
Will end up killing me,
All over, all over again
So I can't turn the lights out
Turn the lights out
(Turn the lights out)
So, I can't turn the lights out
(Turn the lights out)
(Turn the lights out) Astley/Fisher I walk the wire every night
I can't decide between wrong and right
I've lost control over the thing I do
Cos I'm hopelessly falling in love with you Now the one who never took a chance
Becomes a victim of circumstance
I've lost my way, now I'm so confused
Cos I'm hopelessly falling in love with you All my dreams are far behind me
They don't matter any more
I don't care about the things I could lose
Cos I'm hopelessly falling in love with you Now the one who always played it safe
Becomes another who's lost his way
I can't believe it, though I know it's true
Cos I'm hopelessly falling in love with you And all my dreams begin to blind me
And I was so confused
And I don't care about the things I could lose
Cos I'm hopelessly falling in love with you I'm not gonna fight it, I'm gonna choose
To hopelessly fall, oh yeah
You know I'll hopelessly fall in love, with you I know that love could realign the phases of the moon
Yet it comes and goes like a wave of a stranger
And as we stumble for the truth
We're caught in a web of lies
Is nothin' worth a damn without the danger We're lost in a world of illusive dreams
Where every story has a desperate ring We got a right to happiness, in the name of love
And though sometimes we may forget
To give it all we possess
We gotta try for what we get, in the name of love
And without pause or regret, searching only for the best We could see the light unfold right before our eyes
Blinded by the tears, we get lost in the shadows
Oh! But the heart is a wondrous thing
Surviving the thunder, outlasting the rain We got a right to happiness, in the name of love
And though sometimes we may forget
To give it all we possess
We gotta try for what we get, in the name of love
And without pause or regret, searching only for the best Oh! But the heart is a wondrous thing
Surviving the thunder, outlasting the rain We got a right to happiness, in the name of love
And may be sometimes we may forget
To give it all we possess
We gotta try for what we get, in the name of love And without pause or regret
Searching only for the best
Try name of love,
Try in the name of love If you're ever gonna make this work
You gotta pick yourself right up
From out of the dirt
You might need someone
To give you a helping hand
Show you how to love
Make you understand
Well you never thought that you would fall
Now you're on your knees
And you're about ready to crawl
You need someone to rid you of your disease
I'll tell you what to do
Show you how to be If you pray with me
On your knees under the willow trees and
Pray with me
For what we need
Might not be money
Might not be gold Let your love release your soul Come on and pray Won't you pray With me There's electric in your veins It's burning you up
And you can't stand the pain You need someone to listen to your fiction

Who's been kissing you since you went away? You know I've been so lonely every night
Since you went away
Would you let me down any night

There's no question why
How could I be happy when My arms keep missing you
Who's been kissing you since you went away?
My arms keep missing you

Your day has turned
And life gets in your face
When you feel
All light has gone
And darkness fills your space Who do you turn to
Who do you call
To find the love you need
Before you stumble
Before you fall
Turn to me
Turn to me Cos I see stars shining
Like a wish for every one of us
I see silver linings everyday
I see stars shining
A wish to grant us a miracle
There are billions of stars
In our millky way
So wish away When you try your very best
But chances slip away
And the heart beating in your chest
Is broken for the day Who do you turn to
Who do you call
To find the love you need
Before you stumble
Before you fall
Turn to me
Turn to me Cos I see stars shining
A wish for every one of us
I see silver linings every day
I see stars shining
A wish to grant us a miracle
There are billions of stars in our milky way
So wish away Now I've been low
So very low
And I've had no place to go
And it felt like diamonds slipping through my hands
And I've been down
So very down
And I've been lost around this town
And sometimes
No one understands But I see stars shining
Like a wish for every one of us
I see silver linings every day
I see stars shining
A wish to grant us a miracle
There are billions of stars in our milky way
So wish away Astley/West  Do you believe it what the papers say?
They're driving me insane they push me over my limit
Do you believe it they catch me every time?
It ought to be a crime. Wo, the things they say There ought to be a reason for turning black to white
Sometimes get the feeling that it's done to spite
They don't need a reason to turn your world around (Chorus)
I'm waiting for the bell to ring
I want the children to sing 
And I'm waiting for the bad man to fall
I'm just about done with it all Do you believe it, when politicians talk
And make, make the people walk into the fire
Do, you concede, is there no reprieve
From their power game, I know there's someone to blame We ought to be forgiven for taking in their words
They don't even write them now is that absurd
They don't need a reason to tear your world apart (Repeat chorus) And I'm just about done with it all With it all And I'm waiting, you know I'm waiting
For the angels to sing for the freedom it brings
For the bad man to fall
When the children call, I want the angels to sing
And I'm just about done with it all And I'm waiting for the bell to ring
I want the children to sing
And I'm waiting for the bad man to fall
I'm done with it all (Repeat chorus) Astley I went home for the weekend
I saw my friends and my family
I couldn't believe how they'd changed
They where laughing and crying
Feeling all the joy in life
It was so good to feel it too
And I know just how it feels
I know just what it means (Chorus)
When you love someone, it feels so right
When you love someone, they hold you tight
When you love someone, it feels so good
When you love someone, it's understood A couple having a baby
Are giving life to the love they feel
They count the days expectantly
And they, they know just how it feels
Yeah they do, and they, they know just what it means
Just what it means (Repeat chorus) It's just about time for a change
It's just about time for me to rearrange
Just about time for a change
It's just about time for me to rearrange my life (Repeat chorus) I can feel your love slippin' away
Drainin' from my heart, each and every day
I can feel your love slippin' away
Drainin' from my ha-ha-heart, each and every day People ask me, "How's your love affair?"
I can only tell them lies
When they ask me, "Where you are tonight?"
I can only fantasize You may find somebody new
You'll say "You love him", that's not true I can feel your love slippin' away
Drainin' from my heart, each and every day
I can feel your love slippin' away
Drainin' from my ha-ha-heart, each and every day Everybody thinks we're so in love
Things aren't always what they seem
Even my best friend says, "We're so good"
Just how wrong can a person be You may find somebody new
You'll say "You love him", that's not true I can feel your love slippin' away
Drainin' from my heart, each and every day
I can feel your love slippin' away
Drainin' from my ha-ha-heart, each and every day You may find somebody new
You'll say "You love him", that's not true I can feel your love slippin' away
Drainin' from my heart, each and every day
I can feel your love slippin' away
Drainin' from my ha-ha-heart, each and every day I can feel your love slippin' away
Drainin' from my heart, each and every day
I can feel your love slippin' away
Drainin' from my ha-ha-heart, each and every day When I was a boy
I saw my daddy crying at the steering wheel
And oh, it made me feel so scared
Then there was joy
Found my religion, swimming in a chour of voices
And oh, I knew that I'd been spared That I'd be saved some sunny day
Saved from throwing my life away
That I'd be saved some sunny day
From throwing my life, throwing my life away Keep singing, woah, keep singing
Praising to the heavens with my voice ringing
Keep singing, woah, keep singing
Clap to the beat 'till my hands are stinging
And I'd be saved some sunny day
From throwing my life (throwing my life)
Throwing my life (throwing my life) away And now I understand
I'm a wide eyed father, blessed are the children
Oh our greatest reward
And with these hands
I'll move a mountain, build a castle to keep you safe
Of this, you know you can be sure And you'll be saved some sunny day
Saved from throwing your life away
And you'll be saved some sunny day
From throwing your life, throwing your life away Keep singing, woah, keep singing
Praising to the heavens with your voices ringing
Keep singing, woah, keep singing
Clap to the beat 'till your hands are stinging
And you'll be saved some sunny day
From throwing your life (throwing your life)
Throwing your life (throwing your life) away Who do you love
When it all comes down to truth
Who do you love
When it all comes back to you
Who do you love
When you're lying in your bed
Who do you love
Who do you love Keep singing, woah, keep singing, pray
Keep singing, woah, keep singing, pray
Keep singing, woah, keep singing, pray
Keep singing, woah, keep singing, pray And you'll be saved some sunny day
From throwing your life (throwing your life),
Throwing your life (throwing your life) away Sitting On The Balcony Sipping On Her Herbal Tea

One special moment captured in a kiss

And I crawl into my bed
I think of you and where you are tonight
And I wish you were here instead I really want you to know that I'm the one
I'm never letting go
I swear I'll do the best I can to be
Your one and only man cause (Chorus)
You light up my night and day
You bring on the sunshine
You make me feel good today
Yeah you wonderful you When times are hard and nothing goes my way
And I wonder what to do
I think of you and all the things you say
You're the one that pulls me through I really want you to know that I'm the one
I'm never letting go
I swear I'll do the best I can to be
Your true and only man cause (Repeat chorus to fade) Rick Astley & Mark King How can you turn and walk away
Leaving me here with things to say
How can you stand and watch me fall
Don't you feel no love at all I only want to say to you
That it would break your Papa's heart
For him to hear the things you say
When we could make a brand new start (Chorus)
Will you hold me in your arms or let me go
Cause I want to show the world how much I know
That I love you
And I only want to be with you How do I know you'll always stay
You're changing your mind most every day
I'm telling you girl don't push too far no
Just who do you think you are I only want to say to you
That it would break your Mama's heart
For her to hear the things you say
When we could make a brand new start (Repeat chorus two times) Oh I love you so Are you ready, for a guy like me
Come on baby, I'm on bended knee
Are you ready to be loved by me again I only want to say to you That it would break my loving heart
For me to see the things you do
When we could make a brand new start
Yes we could make a brand new start (Repeat chorus to fade) I go to work in my clean shirt
I push a pen until half past ten
I watch the clock there on the wall
Tic toc, why don't you call
The boss comes in and walks down the aisles
He turns around but he never smiles
He watches me just like a hawk
And then he says we must talk You move me, from side to side
You move me and it feels so right
You move me up and down
You move me around and around Son, he says (what) I've got bad news
Life is hard and you got the blues
I know you're good I know you work hard
I'm sorry, son, here are your cards
I went home and kicked off my shoes
And asked myself why do I always lose
But then you rang and everything was fine
I'm so glad that you are mine You move me, from side to side
You move me and it feels so right
You move me up and down
You move me around and around You're the one thing in my life
That makes me feel so good inside
Will you hold me tight tonight
Oh, girl I wish you would decide You move me, from side to side

You move me and it feels so right
You move me up and down
You move me around and around I've been aching for love and alone it seems mine
I've been aching for someone like sun on the vine
I've been hoping there's a chance we can turn this around
And get back on solid ground So let it be tonight
That we make up
And we rid ourselves of all this confusion
So let it be tonight
That we wake up and we commit to make a resolution
To just love
To just love I've been waiting for a moment
To gain your respect
I've been waiting for a moment
For us to reconnect
I've been hoping there's a chance
We can find us again
And if you're wondering when Then let it be tonight
That we make up
And we rid ourselves of all this confusion
So let it be tonight
That we wake up and we commit to make a resolution
To just love

But I can fix this
Let me fix this

To just love There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
Wait for us

Love is a special thing
It means more to me than just a Wedding ring
When two people join as one
They don't know just what has begun It comes to love, honour, cherish and obey
You promised girl that you would not go away When you gonna come back home girl
You know I'm all alone, girl
When you gonna come back home
When you gonna come back home girl
You know I'm all alone, girl
When you gonna come back home [Lisa]
Love is a precious thing
So can't you see the joy that it can bring
So how can you be so cruel
You've gone and broken every rule You promised to love, honour, cherish and obey
You promised me you'd never go away When you gonna stay at home boy
You see I was alone, boy
When you gonna stay at home
When you gonna stay at home boy
You see I was alone, boy
When you gonna stay at home [Rick]
Love's got a hold on me
I need you girl, can't you see [Lisa]
So why don't we spend some time
Let's get together, maybe we could find [Rick & Lisa]
We've got to love, honour, cherish and obey
We've got to promise that we'll never go away Never gonna leave you home, no
Leave you all alone
Now I'm gonna stay at home
Never gonna be alone, no
You see I should have known
Never gonna leave you home [repeat / fade] Don't know what you've got, not till you lose it
You had my love but you only abused it
I've had enough of all your excuses and lies You can look but don't you touch
You played around girl, much too much
You had it all but you gave it up, it's too late, too late, too late What you see is what you don't get
You had your chance and then you blew it
I was the one you never knew it
Now it's time to forget, forget, forget What you see is what you can't have
You're missing out and that is too bad
I was the one who had the last laugh
And all you've got is regret, regret, regret I made up my mind, showed your true colors
One of a kind? No, you're just like the others
I'm saying, goodbye to all your excuses and lies And now there's nothing left to say
So why are you standing in my way?
And don't go begging me to stay, it's too late, too late, too late What you see is what you don't get
You had your chance and then you blew it
I was the one you never knew it
Now it's time to forget, forget, forget What you see is what you can't have

Now it's time to forget, forget, forget What you see is what you can't have
You're missing out and that is too bad
I was the one who had the last laugh
And all you've got is regret, regret, regret What you see is what you don't get
You had your chance and then you blew it
I was the one you never knew it
Now it's time to forget, forget, forget What you see is what you can't have

It's the only thing that there's just too little of
What the world needs now is love, sweet love
No, not just for some but for everyone Lord we don't need another mountain
There are mountains and hillsides enough to climb
There are oceans and rivers enough to cross
Enough to last until the end of time What the world needs now is love, sweet love

What the world needs now is love, sweet love
No, not just for some but for everyone Lord, we don't need another meadow

There are sunbeams and moonbeams enough to shine
Oh, listen Lord, if you want to know What the world needs now is love, sweet love

For being so untrue
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river

Could it be a river of tears I cried in bed?

How I cried a river over you It seems so simple when it rains

Every time you are near?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you. Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you. On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue. That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around.

Only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin
If I can't help falling in love with you? Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Somethings are meant to be Take my hand
Take my whole life, too
For I can't help falling in love with you Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Somethings are meant to be Take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you
For I can't help falling in love with you I don't wanna lose her
I don't wanna lose her They told me that she had found somebody new
But I don't believe it
They said, I would soon find out she was untrue
But I just can't see it Maybe I am wrong to doubt it
And now that I think about it
If ever I lost her love
I'd be nothing, nothing without it I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl
After all that we've been through
I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl of mine
Lose that girl of mine I couldn't imagine life without her love
I just couldn't take it
If you wanted to know how well I would get on
I don't think I'd make it Maybe I just don't show her
And now that I think it's over
I maybe should shout about it
'Cos I'd be nothing, nothing without it I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl
After all that we've been through
I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl of mine
(Lose that girl of mine) I'm gonna make a new start
And bring her back to my heart
'Cos what I found out about her
I just cannot live without her Maybe I just don't show her
And now that I think it's over
I maybe should shout about it
'Cos I'd be nothing, nothing without it I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl
After all that we've been through
I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl of mine
(Lose that girl) I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl
After all that we've been through
I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl of mine
(Lose that girl) I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl
After all that we've been through
I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl of mine
(Lose that girl) And I love you so.
The people ask me how,
How I've lived till now.
I tell them I don't know. I guess they understand
How lonely life has been.
But life began again
The day you took my hand. And, yes, I know how lonely life can be.
The shadows follow me, and the night won't set me free.
But I don't let the evening get me down
Now that you're around me. 
And you love me, too.
Your thoughts are just for me;
You set my spirit free.
I'm happy that you do. The book of life is brief
And once a page is read,
All but love is dead.
That is my belief. And, yes, I know how loveless life can be.
The shadows follow me, and the night won't set me free.
But I don't let the evening bring me down
Now that you're around me. And I love you so.
The people ask me how,
How I've lived till now.
I tell them, "i don't know." Where do I begin
To tell the story of how great a love can be?
The sweet love story that is older than the sea
The simple truth about the love she brings to me
Where do I start? With her first hello
She gave new meaning to this empty world of mine
There'll never be another love, another time
She came into my life and made the living fine
She fills my heart She fills my heart with very special things
With angels' songs, with wild imaginings
She fills my soul with so much love
That everywhere I go I'm never lonely
With you my love, who could be lonely
I reach for her hand-it's always there How long does it last?
Can love be measured by the hours in a day?
I have no answers now but this much I can say
I know I'll need her till the stars all burn away
And she'll be there Breakin' up is so very hard to do If you really love him
And there's nothing I can do
Don't try to spare my feelings
Just tell me that we're through And make it easy on yourself
Make it easy on yourself
'Cause breakin' up is so very hard to do And if the way I hold you
Can't compare to his caress
No words of consolation
Will make me miss you less My darling, if this is goodbye
I just know I'm gonna cry
So run to him before
You start crying too And make it easy on yourself
Make it easy on yourself
'Cause breakin' up is so very hard to do
Oh baby, it's so hard to do Breakin' up is so very hard to do Starry, starry night
Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summers day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul...
Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colours on the snowy linen land. Now I understand
What you tried to say, to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free:
They would not listen; they did not know how --
Perhaps theyll listen now. Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
Colours changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand. Now I understand
What you tried to say, to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free:
They would not listen; they did not know how --
Perhaps they'll listen now. For they could not love you
But still, your love was true
And when no hope was left inside
On that starry, starry night
You took your life as lovers often do --
But I could've told you, Vincent:
This world was never meant
For one as beautiful as you. (without your love) I still have your picture
by the bed where you used to lay
I still have the memories
that you aint goin' from day to day I still miss the little things
you used to do and say
I'll always believe in love
come what may I'm learning to live
without your love
all I can do is carry on
living without you
I'm learning to live
without your love now that you're gone whatever the emptiness
whatever the pain
I won't change my love for you
I'll always feel the same I'm learning to live
without your love
all I can do is carry on
living without you
I'm learning to live
without your love now that you're gone I'm learning to live
I'm learning to live
I'm learning to live
I'm learning to live I still call your number
I'm still in love with you
I still believe in love
maybe that will see me through I'm learning to live
without your love
all I can do is carry on
living without you
I'm learning to live
without your love now that you're gone [repeat / fade] I know its hard to see
Why things ain't going your way, baby
And everyone you know

You don't betray your feelings
But I can read the signs. Stars are shining on a sea of tears
I show my true emotions
I have felt for all these years. You can not tell me
That it's got to end this way
There's nothing more to say. I just can't believe
That you'll walk on out that door
When I need you more and more. (Chorus}
('cos/well) I'm falling in love with you again
After promising to be
Just Good Friends You say you need me but you turn away
I've got to show you how I feel
I've got to make you stay. You cannot tell me
That it's got to end this way
There's nothing more to say. I just can't believe that you'll
Walk on out that door
When I need you more and more 'Cos I'm falling in love with you again
After promising to be
Just Good Friends There are times when a woman makes you laugh and cry
Nobody knows when she is tellin' lies
I just want to hear the truth from you
So don't play those games, the way you always do You don't have to hide the way you feel
(Ooh)
Tell me if your love for me is real, yea Is this really love?
Is this the real thing?
Is this really love?
Can it be the right thing? I was born in a prison there was no way out
If you want to be heard you got to scream and shout
You don't know the kind of mess I'm in
Nobody else is gonna save my skin but You have got the key to set me free
(Ooh)
If you want my love then rescue me Is this really love?
Is this the real thing?
Is this really love?
Can it be the right thing? Is this really love?
Is this the real thing?
Is this really love?
Can it be the right thing? You don't have to hide the way you feel
(Ooh)
Tell me if your love for me is real Is this really love?

(Right thing, right thing)
Is this really love?
Is this the real thing?
Is this really love?
Can it be the right thing? I don't want to be your lover Last night I heard you creeping
I was almost sleeping when I heard you come home
You knew I loved you madly
And I would gladly do anything for you You climbed the stairs to Heaven
But you may never climb those stairs again
You thought you'd be forgiven
But I was driven to make you understand I don't want to be your lover
When there's another lover in your head
I don't want to be your lover
When there's another lover in your bed Tell me, how you could do it?
Why put me through it when you said you'd be true?
You said that it was nothing
But it was something and sometimes that's enough You climbed the stairs to Heaven
But you may never climb those stairs again
You thought you'd be forgiven
But I was driven to make you understand I don't want to be your lover
When there's another lover in your head
I don't want to be your lover
When there's another lover in your bed You climbed the stairs to Heaven
But you may never climb those stairs again
You thought you'd be forgiven
But I was driven to make you understand I don't want to be your lover
When there's another lover in your head
I don't want to be your lover
When there's another lover in your bed I don't want to be your lover
When there's another lover in your head
I don't want to be your lover
When there's another lover in your bed I don't want to be your lover
When there's another lover in your head
I don't want to be your lover
When there's another lover in your bed Stock/Aitken/Waterman  I don't wanna lose her
I don't wanna lose her They told me that she had found somebody new
But I don't believe it
They said I would soon find out she was untrue
But I just can't see it Maybe I am wrong to doubt it
And now that I think about it
If ever I lost her love
I'd be nothing, nothing without it I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl
After all that we've been through
I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl of mine

We just grew apart no one is to blame Woh, woh, woh, woh

Dont ask dont ask me will i be there cause i wont
Cant you see im doin so much better on my own
So dont ask me why dont ask why Paper towers of vogue and vanity fair
They are still standing
And the spaces in the bathroom are incredibly bare
And it's better this way And I don't miss the sunrise
On the colors of your hair
And I don't mind the mornings
No, not much any more But it hurts to breathe
When your perfume's everywhere
And it hurts to breathe
When the memories are hanging in the air There will be dust on the spice rack in no time at all
Tell me, who's around to notice?
I won't run from the shower whenever you call
And it's better this way And I won't miss the starlight
And the clothes you used to wear
And I don't mind the moonlight
No, not much anymore, no, not much anymore But it hurts to breathe
When your perfume's everywhere
And it hurts to breathe
When the memories are hanging in the air I can handle it, I can handle it
I'm getting out more
And you know I'm over it
I'm so over it, until I close the door And it hurts to breathe
When your perfume's everywhere
And it hurts to breathe
When the memories are hanging And it hurts to breathe
When your perfume's everywhere
And it hurts to breathe
When the memories are hanging And it hurts to breathe
When your perfume's everywhere
And it hurts to breathe
When the memories are hanging And it hurts to breathe
And it hurts to breathe Rick Astley  (Chorus)
Behind the smile that I portray
I am saddened every day
My eyes are sore with endless nights of crying
I hope that you don't feel this way My heart fills with tears when you pass me by
You won't look me in the eye
Don't you think that it's a crying shame
We must play these silly games The pain in my heart that shows we're apart
Is growing stronger day by day (Repeat chorus) If you think that I have done you wrong
I won't try to change your mind
But try to think of the love that we once had
And maybe things won't seem so bad The memories of those times are vivid in my mind
And yet they slip away as time goes on Take me back tonight
Hold me close and tight
Forever I will be true Behind the smiles that we portray
There is nothing hidden away
Our eyes are sore because we are crying
I hope we'll always feel this way Astley/Roberts Lately I've been sleeping
Far too long in bed
I've been dreaming of you lover
Oh the things inside my head I don't want to wake up
I'm scared to break the spell
Oh I'm sleeping like a baby
I hope you sleep so well You know I'm hoping, hoping (Bridge)
I know there's a dream for us
I know there's a dream for us
I know there's a dream for us,
Been on our minds
I know there's a dream for us
I know there's a dream for us
I know there's a dream for us,
We're gonna find (Chorus)
I know there's a dream for us
I believe it's true
In a word, love you
And I'm hoping our dream comes true You know I'm hoping, hoping Miracles and moonbeams, wishes on a star
These are things I dream of, I know it sounds bizarre
I see familiar faces, or is it déjÃ vu
The one recurring vision
Is a dream I have of you You know I'm hoping, hoping (Repeat bridge) Come on now baby (Repeat chorus) When you find someone you find someone you love
You know you can't believe it
When you find someone you know you can't deceive it
Your love takes you high I know there's a dream for us
I'm sure there's a dreams for us (Repeat chorus) Astley/West  Children cry on the street
They don't have enough to eat
Mothers wait for days to end
A hopeless situation they can't mend Is it good for you?
Is it good for me?
I don't know how the world can sleep
It's just not right to close the door turn out the light (Chorus)
They'd better be the ones you love
The children ought to get some love
If no-one else should get enough
They'd better be the ones you love Daddy waits there in line
A little work he hopes to find
Something wrong with times like these
It's enough to bring a man down to his knees Is it good for you?
Is it good for me?
I don't know how the world can sleep
It's just not right to close the door turn out the light (Repeat chorus)
(Repeat chorus) Thinking of the children
You better be think about the children
Better be, you better be
Better be the ones you love
Better be, you better be
Better be the ones you love
Yeah yeah yeah (Repeat bridge) (Repeat chorus to fade) Many Roads I've Travelled
And Faces I've Seen
Each Tells A Story
Of What Might Have Been
A Missed Golden Moment
But Life Still Remains
A Search For The Innocence
Somehow We Lost On The Way And We All Need A Miracle, That I Truly Believe
Yes We All Need A Miracle, And I Believe My Miracle Is You Now The Silence That Follows
The Last Curtain Call

Yes We All Need A Miracle, And I Believe My Miracle And I Believe My Miracle

Yes I Believe My Miracle Is You Rick Astley & Rob Fisher She comes home in the morning light
Tries to hide the secret of last night
Tells a tale of working late
Says the things she knows I hate Why should I convince myself
That she loves me and no one else
Feels like time to break the chains
I wont be fooled again Gonna take my time
Gonna take what's mine

Gonna keep my pride
Gonna move right out yeah When we kiss there's no flame
But I believe I'm not to blame

There are times I find it hard to sleep at night
We are living through such troubled times
And every child that reaches out for someone to hold
For one moment they become my own
And how can I pretend that I don't know what's going on
When every second with every minute another soul is gone And I believe that in my life I will see
An end to hopelessness or giving up of suffering
If we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
Stand up for life
Stand up and hear me sing
Stand up for love I'm inspired and hopeful each and every day
That's how I know that things are gonna change
So how can I pretend that I don't know what's going on
When every second with every minute another soul is gone And I believe that in my life I will see
An end to hopelessness of giving up of suffering
If we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
Stand up for life
Stand up for love And it all starts right here and it starts right now
One person stand up there and the rest will follow
For all the forgotten, for all the unloved
I'm gonna sing this song And I believe that in my life I will see
An end to hopelessness of giving up of suffering
If we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
Stand up for life
Stand up and sing
Stand up for love
For love

Taking me places I ain't never been
But now, you're getting comfortable
Ain't doing those things you did no more
You're slowly making me pay for things
Your money should be handling
And now you ask to use my car
Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank
And you have the audacity
To even come and step to me
Ask to hold some money from me
Until you get your check next week
You triflin', good for nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another?
A baller, when times get hard
I need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you, who don't know what a man's about
Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through
Now you've been maxing out my card
Gave me bad credit, buyin' me gifts with my own ends
Haven't paid the first bill
But instead you're headin' to the mall
Goin' on shopping sprees
Perpetrating to your friends like you be ballin'
And then you use my cell phone
Callin' whoever that you thinks at home
And then when the bill comes
All of a sudden you be acting dumb
Don't know where none of these calls come from
When your mommas number's here more than once
You triflin', good for nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another?

And he's missing me if he's not kissing me
And when he looks at me his brown eyes tell it so Remember the first day, the first day we kissed?
Remember the first day we had an argument?
We apologized and then we compromised
And we've haven't argued since Remember the first day we stopped playing games?

We are living through such troubled times
And every child that reaches out for someone to hold
For one moment they become my own And how can I pretend that I don't know what's going on?
When every second and every minute another soul is gone And I believe that in my life I will see
An end to hopelessness
Or giving up
Or suffering Then we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
And stand up for life
Stand up and here me sing
Stand up for love I'm inspired and hopeful each and everyday
That's how I know that things are gonna change So how can I pretend that I don't know what's going on?
When every second and every minute
Another soul is gone And I believe that in my life I will see
An end to hopelessness
Or giving up
Or suffering If we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
Stand up for life
Stand up for love And it all starts right here
And it starts right now
One person stand up
And the rest will follow
For all the forgotten
For all the unloved
I'm gonna sing this song And I believe that in my life I will see
An end to hopelessness
Or giving up
Or suffering
If we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
Stand up for life
Stand up and sing
Stand up for love
For love

In your face I can see the pain, don't you try to convince us that you're happy
We've seen this all before, but he's taking advantage of the passion
Because we've come too far for you to feel alone You don't let him walk over your heart, I'm telling you
Girl, I can tell you've been crying and you needing somebody to talk to
Girl, I can tell he's been lying and pretending that he's faithful and he loves you
Girl, you don't have to be hiding, don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love you
See, what y'all don't know about him is I can't let him go because he needs me
It ain't really him, it's stress from his job and I ain't making it easy I know you see him bugging most of the time
But I know deep inside, he don't mean it
It gets hard sometimes but I need my man, I don't think y'all understand, I'm telling ya
Girl, I can tell you've been crying and you needing somebody to talk to (We understand, don't be ashamed of your friend) Girl, I can tell he's been lying and pretending that he's faithful and he loves you (I can tell he's been lying to you, he's not good for you)
Girl, you don't have to be hiding, don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls

Taking me places I ain't never been
But now, you're getting comfortable
Ain't doing those things you did no more
You're slowly making me pay for things
Your money should be handling
And now you ask to use my car
Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank
And you have the audacity
To even come and step to me
Ask to hold some money from me
Until you get your check next week
You triflin', good for nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another?
A baller, when times get hard
I need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you, who don't know what a man's about
Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through
Now you've been maxing out my card
Gave me bad credit, buyin' me gifts with my own ends
Haven't paid the first bill
But instead you're headin' to the mall
Goin' on shopping sprees
Perpetrating to your friends like you be ballin'
And then you use my cell phone
Callin' whoever that you thinks at home
And then when the bill comes
All of a sudden you be acting dumb
Don't know where none of these calls come from
When your mommas number's here more than once
You triflin', good for nothing type of brother
Silly me, why haven't I found another?
A baller, when times get hard, I need someone to help me out
Instead of a scrub like you, who don't know what a man's about

With a real man, I had given up on love
I didn't think a good man existed in this world
I was tired of searching
Because relationships I've dealt with in the past
Couldn't fathom bein' monogamous
When I least expected it, I found you
And because of you I know how it feels to be (Love)
And when I look into your eyes I see
(Love)
Pillow talk at night and I can hear
(Love)
Oh, the next mornin' we make
(Love)
I'm so in love Through you I live and love again
(Again)

And you keep doin' things to show you're proud of
Thirty beauties in the room, only me you see
The confidence you give lives in me
Ya but I'll never break your heart, I'll never let you down
For better or worse, I'll always be around
And with you here to share my life, so complete
And because of you I know how it feels to be (Love)
And when I look into your eyes I see

Don't you take it personal
If I don't do all the things that I use to do to you
I ain't mad at you If you get to feeling stressed up in your chest thinking
That you're about to lose
And If you're losing out on sleep, home worryin' about me
That's how it be If you don't know
Now you know you're gonna miss my love
And I ain't stressin' 'bout a dog gone thing
'Cause I was true when I gave you my love
If you search you will never find another love like my love
You're gonna miss me
I ain't got time while you sit around and play with my love If you think I caught a feelin' when I heard about that other chick
I already knew about it
I just needed time just to clear my mind and ask myself
Why I didn't handle him? If you would've taken care of home instead of leavin' me alone
I still would be right there with you
Taking care of you, steady loving you
Like I use to do If you don't know
Now you know you're gonna miss my love
And I ain't stressin' 'bout a dog gone thing
'Cause I was true when I gave you my love
If you search you will never find another love like my love
You're gonna miss me
I ain't got time while you sit around and play with my love There was once a time I blame myself for what was wrong
I can see so clearly now because you are gone
That's how I spent all my time when you weren't home
Playin' around with them raggedy heifers
There'll be no more stressin', no more cryin', no more tryin'
I would rather be alone
'Cause this valuable heart of mine was yours until I realized
Finally opened my eyes You see ladies, I know I knew better
What was I thinking?
He gone miss me when I'm gone If you don't know
Now you know you're gonna miss my love
And I ain't stressin' 'bout a dog gone thing
'Cause I was true when I gave you my love
If you search you will never find another love like my love
You're gonna miss me
I ain't got time while you sit around and play with my love Solid gold.

('Cause you're a bug-a, you're buggin' what, you're buggin' who, you're a-buggin' me and don't you see it ain't cool) Thou shall not give into temptation I thought that this was something
Promisin' that one day
It would turn into something
Thought the feelings were mutual
And I didn't have to guess
Started being skeptical
Always unavailable
Like you didn't know But now I'm feelin' something
Tellin' me this may not be
The real something
But you was showing me
Now I'm ready and you runnin'
Damn you got me open
Now I'm feelin' like I'm chokin' now
Now where am I to go? I can't
Believe that you can't feel my heart
And I can't
Believe you let me fall so hard
Stop playin'
How could you let it go this far?
If you had doubts that I wasn't the one
You said
That you're the type to take it slow
You said
Before I stepped I'd let you know
Stop playin'
Before you let me see you with her
You coulda told me a change was gon' come Is she the reason you don't call like you use to
Fall through my hood like you use to
Put it on me hard like you use to do
I feel in my mind what's goin' on
But my heart won't let me go until' I know
Is she the reason that my calls couldn't reach you
The deepest of my love couldn't please you
Or bring it to me home like you use to do
Seein' her fallin' for your charm
Got me feelin' like I wasn't good enough See I know we not official
Us bein' official
Ain't ever been an issue
It came down to us
Boy remember we were different?
You said that we'd talked
If we ever had a problem 'bout anything
I was cool with no commitment
Wait Let me take that back
It was you, so I was with it
I guess I didn't get
When you showed
You didn't miss it
Now it seems that
Your interest ain't here
We ain't the same I can't
Believe that you can't feel my heart
And I can't
Believe you let me fall so hard
Stop playin'
How could you let it go this far?
If you had doubts that I wasn't the one
You said
That your the type to take it slow
You said
Before I stepped I'd let you know
Stop playin'
Before you let me see you with her
You coulda told me a change was gon' come Is she the reason you don't call like you use to
Fall through my hood like you use to
Put it on me hard like you use to do
I feel in my mind what's goin' on
But my heart won't let me go until' I know
Is she the reason that my calls couldn't reach you
The deepest of my love couldn't please you
Or bring it to me home like you use to do
Seein' her fallin' for your charm
Got me feelin' like I wasn't good enough All you had to say was this ain't what you want
I wouldn't be so hurt if I can just move on
You had me believin' that everythin' was my fault
But I can see it now it's a situation that I must let go
'Cause you ain't gonna be a man and let me know
I guess me seein' you with her tells it all Is she the reason you don't call like you use to
Fall through my hood like you use to
Put it on me hard like you use to do
I know in my mind what's goin' on
But my heart won't let me go until' I know
Is she the reason that my calls couldn't reach you
The deepest of my love couldn't please you
Or bring it to me home like you use to do
Seein' her fallin' for your charm
Got me feelin' like I wasn't good enough Is she the reason you don't call like you use to
Fall through my hood like you use to
I put it on me hard like you use to do
I know in my mind what's goin' on
But my heart won't let me go until' I know
Is she the reason that my calls couldn't reach you
The deepest of my love couldn't please you
Or bring it to me home like you use to do
Seein' her fallin' for your charm

You so sexy, imagine how
Intense it would be
To hold me right now
Our song's playin' At night, when you're far and I'm alone
I feel the fabric from your t-shirt
Flow through my thighs
I can still hear your baritone
In my ear telling me you'll take it slow And I was in the mirror playing wrong
Like you were here, I couldn't turn me on
So I fell asleep with the music on
Woke up again hearing the same old song, playing (Ohh ohh)
Give it to me deeper
(Ohh ohh)
Giving me the fever
(Ohh ohh)
Now you got my feet up
This one is a keeper
Now the second is playing (Ohh ohh)
We tried to stand up
(Ohh ohh)
Hold me while my hands up
(Ohh ohh)
And the music picks up
Fantasies were shook up
I'm thinking to myself again When you're not here
(I sleep in your t-shirt)
I wish you were here
(To take off your t-shirt)
After we make love
(I sleep in your t-shirt)
Wake up in your t-shirt
I smell the scent of your cologne When I need your feel
(I sleep in your t-shirt)
I need your help
(To take off your t-shirt)
After we make love
(I sleep in your t-shirt)
Wake up in your t-shirt
I smell the scent of your cologne Outside I hear the rain on my windowpane
Hold up a minute, thought I heard your name
My mind, playing tricks on me again
I hear knocks at the door, is that my baby home Why couldn't it be reality?
Looked at the clock and it's a four o three
At nine, you'll be arriving on a plane
Then we'll be making love and hearing the song again (Ohh ohh)
Give it to me deeper
(Ohh ohh)
Giving me the fever
(Ohh ohh)
Now you got my feet up
This one is a keeper
Now the second is playing (Ohh ohh)
We tried to stand up
(Ohh ohh)
Hold me while my hands up
(Ohh ohh)
And the music picks up
Fantasies were shook up

The most beautifulest girl in the world
You are my survivor and I admire you
You have no idea how special you are
Humble, talented and blessed you are

Your sweet precious gift of love

And it feels so good to have travelled
Half the road of life with an angel
Walking and learning and teaching you the whole time
God is so awesome
And I thank him for answering my prayers as a child
I never told you this, but I prayed for
A lifelong friend as a child
And God just has his way of sending precious treasures
And I found mine
Everyday our relationship gets stronger

Loyal, unselfish, generous, gifted, wise and beautiful
Person you are
No one absolutley no one can take that away from us
You are the definition of a true friend B and Kelly you two mean so much to me
Only God knew that this union was meant to be
Only God knew all the things we couldn't see
But if we pray together
We'll stay together Beyonce and Kelly
You both exemplify coming from my eyes
What love is
"Love is patient" Beyonce thats what you've been
"Love is kind" Miss Kelly, thats what you have shown
"It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud, it is not rude
It is not self seeking, it is not easily angered
It keeps no record of wrong
Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth
It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres"

Eyes wide open
And we dreamed together
I never know how we keep
Our shit together

Is this love or Illusion
We're just getting better
When the two become one
On a Quatum Level It's Nuclear
We're two here
Yjere's nowhere left to run
Why run? Why would u run?
It's Nuclear
We're two here
We both heat up
Going All the way eeh eeh x4 You Had ur Half
& i had mine
But now there's no such thing
As you & me
I was so used to feeling incomplete
& I'm wondering
Is this love or Illusion
We're just getting better
When the two become one
On a Quantum level It's Nuclear
We're two here
There's nowhere left to run
Why run? why would u run?
It's nuclear

So amazing super power
Take over
Never lose the energy It's Nuclear
We're two here
There's nowhere left to run
Why run? why would u run?
It's nuclear
We're two here
We're both heat up
Going all the way eeh eeh x4 The day you pissed me off I told Mike to pick me up
I told him you was buggin' and I don't like to fuss
He said he would look out for me if I needed a friend
He took me to his house and then he invited me in Then we sat on the couch, he put his arms around my waist
Knowin' I need lovin' then he gently grabbed my face
He kissed me like a guy could never kiss a girl before
So you know what happened baby, I need to say no more I'm just confessing about some things I did
I might as well come clean, what you feel about that baby?
I'm just confessing 'bout the things I did
I might as well come clean, what you feel about that baby? I'm just guessing that you through with me
'Cause I just came clean, what you feel about that baby?
I'm just guessing, are you through with me?
'Cause I just came clean, what you feel about that? two Remember the time you wondered where your money went
I called my friends and bought some clothes and took them on a trip
I met a dude that had a jeep and we talked all the time
He asked me 'bout my man and you know that I had to lie He thought I had no man and I was chillin' by myself
Don't get mad 'cause I feel sad that's why I must confess
So many times I wanted to let you know my dirt
But every time you said you loved me, I knew it would hurt I'm just confessing about some things I did
I might as well come clean, what you feel about that baby?
I'm just confessing 'bout the things I did
I might as well come clean, what you feel about that baby? I'm just guessing that you through with me
'Cause I just came clean, what you feel about that baby?
I'm just guessing, are you through with me?
'Cause I just came clean, what you feel about that? I was mad, what was I to do?
Never had any mind to play on you
Look at all the hurt you put me through
I can't tell a lie so I'm tellin' the truth I was mad, what was I to do?
I never had any mind to play on you
Look at all the hurt you put me through
You know, you know I was mad, what was I to do?
Never had any mind to play on you
Look at all the hurt you put me through
I can't tell a lie so I'm tellin' the truth I was mad, what was I to do?
I never had any mind to play on you
Look at all the hurt you put me through
You know, you know I'm just confessing about some things I did

Confessing baby, misdemeanor
Destiny, uh uh uh, we out 2 0 0 0, one time, destiny Thou shall now burn Funky!! Chorus:
Smell all that funk
(Out ya mouth)
I can smell your breath
(Make ya shout)
Do you smell your breath
(Holler out)
What's up with your breath
(Repeat) Verse:
Ewww!
Ya talking to me and now I'm talking to you
You coming too close and I don't know what to do
I breathed in deep I felt like saying to you
Forget you, forgot you, never thoght about you
Your breathe is kickng smell like old onion soup
Ewww!
I'm starting to believe that's it's way too much for you
To take a Tic-Tac but I know that it wouldn't help you
You keep on talking trying to give you a clue
That you need to brush your teeth to-
Morrow in the morning and at night too Chorus 2x Verse:
If your breath makes me say, "Ewww!"
You know what to do
Get on out of my face
You in my personal space
If your breath makes me say, "Ewww!"
Get up out of my grill
You don't have no business in this
Get to steppin' here's some Listerine Strips
(Strips echoes) Chorus 2x What's up with your breath I saw your new girlfriend the other day
And I expected for her to be so much more than she was
I checked out her style, the way she smiled
The way she moved, the things she said
The way she looked at me like "I got yo' man" She can't love you like I can
All of her love just can't compare to what I have
She can't touch you like I do
'Cause when y'all touchin', you pretend it's me and you There's no way, her love's as good as mine
There's no reason for you to waste your time When we were together, you told me what you didn't like
And you went out and got exactly that type
You said that your new girl is nothing compared to me
Everything that she does wrong, I always do right She can't hold you like I can
Boy, you a fool if you can't realize what you had
She can't feel you like I can
'Cause I'm a girl that's always standin' by my man And there's no way, her love's as good as mine
There's no reason for you to waste your time
And there's no way her love's as good as mine
There's no reason for you to waste your time There's no way, there's no way
That her love could be, could be as good as mine
There's no reason, no reason
For you to even go and waste your time, your time And there's no way, her love's as good as mine
There's no reason for you to waste your time
And there's no way her love's as good as mine
There's no reason for you to waste your time And there's no way, her love's as good as mine
There's no reason for you to waste your time If thou can wait, then thou can stay Thank you, Lord, hallelujah
You've been so good to me
Thank you, Lord, hallelujah
I'm grateful for my blessings I'm grateful for my struggles
Trials and tribulations I've been through
Ive realized no one can love like You do Thank you, Lord, hallelujah
I feel your presence near
Thank you, Lord, hallelujah
I wont hold back my tears I gave you my trust
And you took me out of the dark rain
My Lord I survived it
I give You the praise Lord, you've been so good
You've been so good to me
I'm so grateful for my blessings
Givin' you all the praise Lord, you've been so good
You've been so good to me
I'm grateful for all of my blessings
Giving you all the praise Jesus loves me, oh yes He does
Jesus loves me, oh yes He does
Jesus loves me, oh yes He does
For the Bible tells me so
So so, oh so
(My Jesus loves me, I know) A-a-a-men, a-a-a-a-men
A-a-a-men, a-a-a-a-men
A-a-a-men, a-a-a-a-men
A-a-a-men, a-a-a-a-men Baby, I want for nothing
Just your tender sweet loving
I know you've got your things to do
But tell me what means more to you
Hanging out with me or with your boys Sometimes I do get lonely
No you and no one to hold me
You want so much to lay me down
Is that what keeps you hanging 'round?
Is that the only way to win your heart? Well if I loved you a little bit longer
If my love was a little bit stronger
Would you stay, stay?
Baby, please stay If I granted all of your wishes
Give you more than touches and kisses
Would you stay, stay?
I need you to stay I'll be, be yours forever
But can we keep us together?
I know the time is drawing near
I promised you has it been a year
Baby, now I'm ready, will you stay, stay? If I loved you a little bit longer
If my love was a little bit stronger
Would you stay, stay?
Baby, please stay If I granted all of your wishes
Give you more than touches and kisses
Would you stay, stay?
I need you to stay Every night I lay and think about it
If you love me you could live without it
But I don't wanna do you that way
No no no no no I don't know exactly what I'm feelin'
I'm kinda scared but I'm then kinda willing
Will you promise me just one thing?
No matter what, you're gonna stay If I loved you a little bit longer
If my love was a little bit stronger
Would you stay, stay?
Baby, please stay If I granted all of your wishes
Give you more than touches and kisses
Would you stay, stay?
I need you to stay If I loved you a little bit longer
If my love was a little bit stronger
Would you stay, stay?
Baby, please stay If I granted all of your wishes
Give you more than touches and kisses
Would you stay, stay?
I need you to stay If I loved you a little bit longer
If my love was a little bit stronger
Would you stay, stay?

Take A Minute Girl Come Sit Down
And Tell Us What's Been Happening
In Your Face I Can See The Pain
Don't You Try To Convince Us That You're Happy (Yeah)
We've Seen This All Before
But He's Taking Advantage Of Your Passion
Because We've Come Too Far
For You To Feel Alone
You Don't Let Him Walk Over Your Heart
I'm Telling You
[Chorus]
Girl, I Can Tell You've Been Crying
And You Needing Somebody To Talk To
Girl, I Can Tell He's Been Lying
And Pretending That He's Faithful And He Loves You
Girl, You Don't Have To Be Hiding
Don't You Be Ashamed To Say He Hurt You
I'm Your Girl, You're My Girl, We're Your Girls
Don't You To Know That We Love You?
[Verse 2 Kelly]
See What You All Don't Know About Him
Is I Can't Let Him Go Because He Needs Me
It Ain't Really Him It's Stress From His Job
And I Ain't Making It Easy
I Know You See Him Bugging On Me Sometimes
But I Know Deep Inside He Don't Mean It
It Gets Hard Sometimes
But I Need My Man
I Don't Think Ya'll Understand
I'm Telling You
[Chorus x2]
[Bridge Michelle]
Girl, Take A Good Look At Yourself
He Got You Going Through Hell
We Ain't Never Seen You Down Like This
What You Mean You Don't Need Us To Help?
We Known Each Other Too Well

To put on my happy face Woke up and realized
This world's not so bad after all
Looked at it through a child's eyes
And I saw these beautiful
Things that you never think about
Like the ocean, moonlight, stars and clouds
It's amazing how we don't
Appreciate our blessings There's plenty of people who don't like me
But there's ten times more who love me
And I love myself
Sometimes, it gets tough, it gets tough
But I can't give up, can't give up
Just take a deep breath, close my eyes
Feel the love and give a smile I woke up this morning

Body rockkk baby bring it home "O' Holy Night" O' holy night the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear saviors birth
Umm. Umm
Long lay the world, in sin and error pining
To he appeared and the soul felt His word
The thrill of hope
The weary soul rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn'
Oh oh oh fall on your knees
Oh hear the angels voices
Oh night (oh night devine)
O' holy night (oh holy night)
When christ was born
Oh oh oh fall on your knees
O' hear the angels voices
O' night (oh night devine)
O' holy night (oh holy night)
When Christ was born
Holy night, holy night when Christ was born
(Born, Christ in the highest)

(King of Kings, Lord of Lords, on holy night)
Holy night, holy night, holy night, holy night, holy night
(Holy) (Performed by Kelly Rowland) I wanna love together
Kiss and touching feels better
Now that I have, have you
I couldn't ask for nothing more.
Like a misty breeze on a summer day
Or the warmth of sun after rain, you,
Always seem to balance me with your love
If you're far away
I want you near might sound clich√©
But my words are so sincere can't you
Taste the joy inside my tears (I'm so in love) I've found love's treasure in this ocean of pleasure
And now that I have, have you
I won't search for anything more
Oh love
What have you done to me
This crazy feeling I can't describe
It feels like love it must be love it must be love
Feels like snow caressing mountain tops
When I see your eyes from afar
All I can do is run with open arms
Love is all I got
I feel so at home
When we're alone, oh Love, when I'm in your arms
Feels like I'm melting into you
You keep me so warm
Ooh, I feel so high above
Caught a glimpse of heaven in your eyes
Thanks for showing me love (Your love so good) Baby we will grow together; this is a joint endeavor
And there's nothing I'd rather see,
Than the love in your eyes for me
'Cause this feeling is so surreal,
You touch me places I didn't feel
I used won't but now I will trust in love
I'm elated and overjoyed.
Over this connection between a girl and boy
I was empty till you filled the void,
I'm so in love Love, when I'm in your arms
Feels like I'm melting into you
You keep me so warm
Ooh, I feel so high above
Caught a glimpse of heaven in your eyes
Thanks for showing me love (Your love so good) Uh uh, hey, baby, how you?
Why yo' face lookin' all sad and blue?
Don't you like the Navigator truck that I bought you?
Why you trying to act a fool? Don't try to say you seen me talking to your girlfriends
Ask Tonya and Shirl, then
Gimme a place and time when
Don't try to accuse me of silly stuff
That I'm doing on the streets You gotta remember
Without you, there's no me
I'm just a average man
Tryin' to make it in this cold world
Tell me, baby, why you trippin', girl? I don't wanna fuss with you
So I'm gonna sit out on the couch
Don't try to talk to me
'Cause, boy, I am locking you out I don't wanna hear a thing
Nothin' you've got to say
You should think twice
About the way you been talkin' to me Better catch a cab, get on the bus
I ain't got no time for you talking all that junk
I'm here to pack my stuff, is this what you want?
I don't really care, 'cause there's no more us Better catch a cab, get on the bus
I ain't got no time for you talking all that junk
I'm here to pack my stuff, is this what you want?
I don't really care Ain't got no words for you
So you can stop callin' my friends
Tellin' them it wasn't your fault
And why I ain't lettin' you in Too many times before
I let you back in my life
But this is a new day
And this won't go down tonight Better catch a cab, get on the bus
I ain't got no time for you talking all that junk
I'm here to pack my stuff, is this what you want?
I don't really care, 'cause there's no more us Better catch a cab, get on the bus
I ain't got no time for you talking all that junk
I'm here to pack my stuff, is this what you want?
I don't really care, 'cause there's no more us duce you to Dolce and Gabbana
Advance you from dirtbikes to Hondas
Took you from that terrible stress
Now you telling me that I am a bother What kind of mess is that
To tell a man who put you on his team?
That's just like killing a dream
(No, no, baby)
That's how it seems I worked hard to build up what I had for you
I pray to God, there's not another man between me and you
So just tell me, there's no need to lie
For while you sleepin' with your eyes closed
Do you wanna talk? A'ight yo Better catch a cab, get on the bus
I ain't got no time for you talking all that junk
I'm here to pack my stuff, is this what you want?
I don't really care, 'cause there's no more us Better catch a cab, get on the bus
I ain't got no time for you talking all that junk
I'm here to pack my stuff, is this what you want?

Illusion (featuring Wyclef Jean & Pras)
Went from a dream to the young supremes searching for a destiny that's mine
There's another place another time
Touching many hearts along the way yeah
Hoping that i'll never have to say
Boy i love you but i gotta let you go: Everyday in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusion
Trapped in a world only you get in
My minds playing tricks on me again Daze in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusion
Trapped in a world only you get in
My minds playing tricks on me again Follow your emotions everywhere
Is there really magic in the air
Never let your feeling let you down
Open up your eyes and look around
Boy i love you but i gotta let you go Can it be a picture in my mind
Never sure exactly what i'll find
Only in my dreams i turn you own
Here for just a moment then you're gone (pras) i don't write love song
Leave it up to luther vandross
How i choose to live you don't wanna know the course

We are living through such troubled times
And every child that reaches out for someone to hold
For one moment they become my own
And how can I pretend that I don't know what's going on
When every second with every minute another soul is gone And I believe that in my life I will see
An end to hopelessness or giving up of suffering
If we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
Stand up for life
Stand up and hear me sing
Stand up for love I'm inspired and hopeful each and every day
That's how I know that things are gonna change
So how can I pretend that I don't know what's going on
When every second with every minute another soul is gone And I believe that in my life I will see
An end to hopelessness of giving up of suffering
If we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
Stand up for life
Stand up for love And it all starts right here and it starts right now
One person stand up there and the rest will follow
For all the forgotten, for all the unloved
I'm gonna sing this song And I believe that in my life I will see
An end to hopelessness of giving up of suffering
If we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
Stand up for life
Stand up and sing
Stand up for love
For love
For love You couldn't tell little Jackie nothing

Prancer and Vixen comet and Cupid and
Donner and Blitzen but do you recall?
The most famous reindeer of all Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
"Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?" Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer
"You'll go down in history" Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
Rudolph we love you boy
Rudolph the red nose reindeer
Bringing us Christmas joy Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
"Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?" Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
"You'll go down in history" Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
Rudolph we love you boy
Rudolph the red nose reindeer
Spreading the Christmas joy Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
Rudolph we love you boy
Rudolph the red nose reindeer
Bringing us Christmas joy Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
"Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?" Dasher, dancer, prancer, vixen
Comet, cupid, Donner and Blitzen
But don't you forget
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer How many times
Are you gonna apologize about the same thing?
And how many times can I take it back
When I'm not the one that's doin' wrong?
(When I'm not the one that's doin' wrong, no)
I thought maybe if I started prayin'
That we would get better
But when I would pray the answer
Would always come back to me bein' done
But we are so hard headed when we're in love
So I I told myself that I would make some changes
(Yeah)
But the more I change there's one thing that remains the same
(The same)
I can't seem to shake ya
You seem to really have a hold on me
And every time that we break up
We turn around and make up
This can't go on now
(No)
I gotta move on now
It's not the fact that I don't love you no more
But I gotta break this bad habit
Can't take this bad habit no more I'm totally out of my element
Learnin' new ways to live, while your in a comfort zone
Not even thinkin',
(You couldn't think about me)
To call and then when I get mad you buy me gifts
Thinkin' it's gonna solve every issue
From the girl callin' my phone
(Phone)
To the pictures that I saw
(You know what I saw)
And every time you would break up with me for nothing at all
I've takin' all I could take
(I've takin' all I could take)
But the way I live has gotta change, oh I told myself that I would make some changes
(I told myself that I would)
But the more I change there's one thing that remains the same
I can't seem to shake ya
(Shake ya)
You seem to really have a hold on me
(You really have a hold on me)
And every time that we break up
We turn around and make up
(Turn around)
This can't go on now
(Can't do it no more baby, no, no, no)
I gotta move on now
It's not the fact that I don't love you no more
(Love you no more)
But I gotta break this bad habit
Can't take this bad habit Let me break it down
Have you ever loved somebody?
So much that you was just to blind to see
Past, all of the pain they was causing you
(Causing you)
Ladies, do you feel me?
(Do you feel me?)
Have you ever loved somebody
So much that you went against the right things that you should do?
(Do)
Then it's time to make a change
(Time to make a change)
So I I told myself that I would make some changes
(Make some changes)
But the more I change there's one thing that remains the same
(Baby it the same)
I can't seem to shake ya
You seem to really have a hold on me
(You really have a hold on me)
And every time that we break up
We turn around and make up
(Turn around)
This can't go on now
(Can't go on now)
I gotta move on now
It's not the fact that I don't love you no more
(Love you no more)

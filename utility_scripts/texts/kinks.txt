I met her in a club down in old Soho
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like Coca-Cola
C-O-L-A, Cola
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola
L-O-L-A, Lola
La-la-la-la Lola Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine, oh my Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
Well, I'm not dumb but I can't understand
Why she walked like a woman but talked like a man, oh my Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
La-la-la-la Lola Well, we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candlelight
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
And said "Dear boy, won't you come home with me?"
Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy
But when I looked in her eyes, well I almost fell for my Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
La-la-la-la Lola I pushed her away
I walked to the door
I fell to the floor
I got down on my knees
Then I looked at her and she at me Well, that's the way that I want it to stay
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
It's a mixed up, muddled up, sup world, except for Lola
La-la-la-la Lola Well, I left home just a week before
And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
But Lola smiled and took me by the hand
And said "Dear boy, I'm gonna make you a man" Well, I'm not the world's most masculine man
But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man
And so is Lola
La-la-la-la Lola
La-la-la-la Lola Lola

All I've got's this sunny afternoon Save me, save me

Why I ought to stay 'Cause I love to live so pleasantly

Oh! Oh! Oh! Dirty old river, must you keep rolling, flowing into the night?
People so busy, make me feel dizzy, taxi light shines so bright
But I don't need no friends
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset, I am in paradise (Sha-la-la) Every day I look at the world from my window
(Sha-la-la) But chilly, chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine (Waterloo sunset's fine) Terry meets Julie, Waterloo Station, every Friday night
But I am so lazy, don't want to wander, I stay at home at night
But I don't feel afraid
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset, I am in paradise (Sha-la-la) Every day I look at the world from my window
(Sha-la-la) But chilly, chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine (Waterloo sunset's fine) Millions of people swarming like flies 'round Waterloo underground
But Terry and Julie cross over the river where they feel safe and sound
And they don't need no friends
As long as they gaze on Waterloo sunset they are in paradise Waterloo sunset's fine
Waterloo sunset's fine

(and it goes like this.) When I look up from my pillow I dream you are there with me.
Though you are far away I know you'll always be near to me.
I go to sleep, sleep, and imagine that you're there with me.
I go to sleep, sleep, and imagine that you're there with me. I look around me and feel you are ever so close to me.
Each tear that flows from my eyes brings back memories of you to me.
I go to sleep, sleep, and imagine that you're there with me.
I go to sleep, sleep, and imagine that you're there with me. I was wrong, I will cry, I will love you to the day I die.
You alone, you alone and no one else, you were meant for me. When morning comes once more I have the loneliness you left me.
Each day drags by until finally night time descends on me.
I go to sleep, sleep, and imagine that you're there with me.
I go to sleep, sleep, and imagine that you're there with me. They put a parking lot on a piece of land
Where the supermarket used to stand
Before that, they put up a bowling alley
On the site that used to be the local palais
That's where the big bands used to come and play
My sister went there on a Saturday Come dancing
All her boyfriends used to come and call
Why not come dancing?
It's only natural Another Saturday, another date
She would be ready, but she'd always make him wait
In the hallway, in anticipation
He didn't know the night would end up in frustration
He'd end up blowing all his wages for the week
All for a cuddle and a peck on the cheek Come dancing
That's how they did it when I was just a kid
And when they said come dancing
My sister always did My sister should have come in at midnight
And my mom would always sit up and wait
It always ended up in a big row
When my sister used to get home late Out of my window I could see them in the moonlight
Two silhouettes saying good nights by the garden gate What are you doing out there?
Come on! Are you gonna be out there all night? The day they knocked down the palais
My sister stood and cried
The day they knocked down the palais
Part of my childhood died, just died Now I'm grown up and playing in a band
And there's a car park where the palais used to stand
My sister's married, and she lives on an estate
Her daughters go out, now it's her turn to wait
She knows they get away with things she never could
But if I asked her, I wonder if she would Come dancing
Come on, sister, have yourself a ball
Don't be afraid to come dancing
It's only natural Come dancing
Just like the palais on a Saturday
And all her friends would come dancing
While the big bands used to play Long ago, life was clean
Sex was bad, called obscene
And the rich were so mean
Stately homes for the Lords
Croquet lawns, village greens
Victoria was my queen Victoria
Victoria
Victoria, 'toria I was born, lucky me
In a land that I love
Though I'm poor, I am free
When I grow, I shall fight
For this land, I shall die
Let her sun never set Victoria
Victoria
Victoria, 'toria Victoria
Victoria
Victoria, 'toria Land of hope and gloria
Land of my Victoria
Land of hope and gloria
Land of my Victoria
Victoria, 'toria Victoria
Victoria
Victoria, 'toria Canada to India
Australia to Cornwall
Singapore to Hong Kong
From the west to the east
From the rich to the poor
Victoria loved them all
Victoria
Victoria
Victoria, 'toria
Victoria
Victoria
Victoria Where are you going I don't mind
I've killed my world and I've killed my time
So where do I go, what do I see
I see many people coming after me
So where are you going to I don't mind
If I live too long I'm afraid I'll die
So I will follow you wherever you go
If your offered hand is still open to me Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two, we are one So you've been where I've just come
From the land that brings losers on
So we will share this road we walk
And mind our mouths and beware our talk
'Till peace we find tell you what I'll do
All the things I own I will share with you
And if I feel tomorrow like I feel today
We'll take what we want and give the rest away Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two, we are one Holy man and holy priest
This love of life makes me weak at my knees
And when we get there make your play
'cause soon I feel you're gonna carry us away
In a promised lie you made us believe
For many men there is so much grief
And my mind is proud but it aches with rage
And if I live too long I'm afraid I'll die Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two, we are one
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two, we are one You look out of your window,
Into the night.
Could be rain, could be snow,
But it can't feel as cold as you're feeling inside. And all of you friends are either married, vanished,
Or just left alone.
But that's no reason to just stop living.
That's no excuse to just give in to a sad and lonely heart. Don't forget to dance, no, no, no,
Don't forget to smile.
Don't forget to dance, no, no, no,
Forget it for a while. 'Cause darling, darling,
I bet you danced a good one in your time.
And if this were a party
I'd really make sure the next one would be mine.
Yes, you with the broken heart. Don't forget to dance, no, no, no,
Don't forget to smile.
Don't forget to dance, no, no, no,
Forget it for a while. Don't forget to dance, no, no, no,
Forget it for a while. You walk down the street
And all the young punks whistle at you.
A nice bit of old,
Just goes to show what you can achieve
with the right attitude.
As you pass them by
They whisper their remarks one to another,
And you give them the eye
Even that you know that you could be their mother.
You do the thing you love the most.
What separates you from the rest,
And what you love to do the most?
And when they ask me how you dance,
I say that you dance real close. Don't forget to dance, no, no, no,
Don't forget to dance. I won't take all that they hand me down
And make out a smile, though I wear a frown
And I'm not gonna take it all lying down
'Cause once I get started I go to town 'Cause I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else And I don't wanna ball about like everybody else
And I don't wanna live my life like everybody else
And I won't say that I feel fine like everybody else
'Cause I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else But darling, you know that I love you true
Do anything that you want me to
Confess all my sins like you want me to
There's one thing that I will say to you I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else And I don't wanna to ball about like everybody else
And I don't wanna live my life like everybody else
And I won't say that I feel fine like everybody else
'Cause I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else Like everybody else
Like everybody else
Like everybody else
Like everybody else If you all want me to settle down
Slow up and stop all my running 'round
Do everything like you want me to
There's one thing that I will say to you I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else And I don't wanna to ball about like everybody else
And I don't wanna to live my life like everybody else
And I don't wanna [incomprehensible] like everybody else
'Cause I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else Like everybody else
Like everybody else
Like everybody else
Like everybody else From the dew-soaked hedge creeps a crawly caterpillar
When the dawn begins to crack
It's all part of my autumn almanac Breeze blows leaves of a musty-coloured yellow
So I sweep them in my sack
Yes, yes, yes, it's my autumn almanac Friday evenings, people get together

His clothes are loud, but never square
It will make or break him so he's got to buy the best
'Cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion And when he does his little rounds
'Round the boutiques of London town
Eagerly pursuing all the latest fads and trends
'Cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion Oh yes, he is (Oh yes, he is)
Oh yes, he is (Oh yes, he is)
He thinks he is a flower to be looked at
And when he pulls his frilly nylon panties right up tight
He feels a dedicated follower of fashion Oh yes, he is (Oh yes, he is)
Oh yes, he is (Oh yes, he is)
There's one thing that he loves and that is flattery
One week he's in polka-dots, the next week he's in stripes
'Cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion They seek him here, they seek him there
In Regent Street and Leicester Square
Everywhere the Carnabetian army marches on
Each one a dedicated follower of fashion Oh yes, he is (Oh yes, he is)
Oh yes, he is (Oh yes, he is)
His world is built 'round discotheques and parties
This pleasure-seeking individual always looks his best
'Cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion Oh yes, he is (Oh yes, he is)
Oh yes, he is (Oh yes, he is)
He flits from shop to shop just like a butterfly
In matters of the cloth, he is as fickle as can be
'Cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion
He's a dedicated follower of fashion
He's a dedicated follower of fashion I think I'm so sophisticated, 'cause I'm living my life like a good homo sapiens
But all around me everybody's multiplying, and they're walking round like flies, man
So I'm no better than the animals sitting in the cages in the zoo, man
'cause compared to the flowers and the birds and the trees -- I am an apeman I think I'm so educated and I'm so civilized 'cause I'm a strict vegetarian
And with the over population, and inflation and starvation, and the crazy politicians
I don't feel safe in this world no more, I don't want to die in a nuclear war
I want to sail away to a distant shore, and make like an apeman I'm an apeman
I'm an ape, apeman
Oh, I'm an apeman I'm a king-kong man
I'm a voodoo man
Oh, I'm an apeman 'cause compared to the sun that sits in the sky
Compared to the clouds as they roll by
Compared to the bugs and the spiders and flies
I am an apeman. La la la la... In man's evolution he's created the city and the motor traffic rumble
But give me half a chance and I'd be taking off my clothes and living in the jungle
'cause the only time that I feel at ease is swinging up and down in a coconut tree
Oh what a life of luxury -- to be like an apeman I'm an apeman
I'm an ape, apeman
Oh, I'm an apeman I'm a king-kong man
I'm a voodoo man
Oh, I'm an apeman I look out the window, but I can't see the sky
The air pollution is a-fogging up my eyes
I want to get out of this city alive
And make like an apeman La la la la... Come on and love me -
Be my apeman girl
And we'd be so happy -
In my apeman world I'm an apeman
I'm an ape, apeman
Oh, I'm an apeman I'm a king-kong man
I'm a voodoo man
Oh, I'm an apeman I'll be your Tarzan and you'll be my Jane
I'll keep you warm and you'll keep me sane
We'll sit in the trees and eat bananas all day
Just like an apeman I'm an apeman
I'm an ape, apeman
Oh, I'm an apeman I'm a king-kong man
I'm a voodoo man
Oh, I'm an apeman I don't feel safe in this world no more, I don't want to die in a nuclear war
I want to sail away to a distant shore, and make like an apeman La la la la... I've got your picture of me and you
You wrote "I love you" I wrote "me too"
I sit there staring and there's nothing else to do
Oh it's in colour
Your hair is brown
Your eyes are hazel
And soft as clouds
I often kiss you when there's no one else around I've got your picture, I've got your picture

Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa) I am a dull and simple lad
Cannot tell water from champagne
And I have never met the Queen
And I wish I could have all that he has got (Hey!)
And I wish I could be like David Watts (Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa) And when I lie on my pillow at night
I dream I could fight like David Watts
Lead the school team to victory
And take my exams and pass the lot (Wish I could be) Wish I could be like David Watts
(Wish I could be) Wish I could be like David Watts
(Wish I could be) Conduct my life like David Watts
(Wish I could be) I wish I could be like David Watts (Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa) He is the head boy at the school
He is the captain of the team
He is so gay and fancy free
And I wish all his money belonged to me (Hey!)
And I wish I could be like David Watts (Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa) And all the girls in the neighbourhood
Try to go out with David Watts
They try their best but can't succeed
For he is of pure and noble breed Wish I could be like
Wish I could be like
Wish I could be like (Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa) Well Mr. Churchill says, Mr. Churchill says
We gotta fight the bloody battle to the very end
Mr. Beaverbrook says we gotta save our tin
And all the garden gates
And empty cans are gonna make us win We shall defend our island
On the land and on the sea
We shall fight them on the beaches
On the hills and in the fields
We shall fight them in the streets
Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed to so few
'Cos they have made our British Empire
A better place for me and you
And this was their finest hour
Well Mr. Montgomery says
And Mr. Mountbatten says
We gotta fight the bloody battle to the very end
As Vera Lynn would say
We'll meet again someday
But all the sacrifices we must make before the end Did you hear that plane flying overhead
There's a house an fire and there's someone lying dead
We gotta clean up the streets
And get me back on my feet
Because we wanna be free
Do your worst and we'll do our best
We're gonna win the way that Mr. Churchill says
Oh! oh! oh! oh! oh! oh! Well Mr. Churchill says
We gotta hold up our chins
We gotta show some courage and some discipline
We gotta black up the windows and nail up the doors
And keep right on till the end of the war Big Sky looked down on all the people looking up at the Big Sky.
Everybody pushing one another around
Big Sky feels sad when he sees the children scream and cry
But the Big Sky's too big to let it get him down. Big Sky too big to cry
Big Sky too high to see
People like you and me One day we'll be free, we won't care, just you see
'Til that day can be, don't let it get you down
When I feel that the world is too much for me
I think of the Big Sky, and nothing matters much to me. Big Sky looked down on all the people who think they got problems
They get depressed and they hold their head in their hands and cry.
People lift up their hands and they look up to the Big Sky
But Big Sky is too big to sympathize Big Sky's too occupied
Though he would like to try
And he feels bad inside
Big Sky's too big to cry One day we'll be free, we won't care, just you wait and see
'Til that day can be, don't let it get you down.
When I feel that the world is too much for me
I think of the Big Sky, and nothing matters much to me Life grinds on day after day.
In the city streets and motorways.
The tension spreads just like a plague,
Killing reason on the way.
Like wildfire it spreads through the nation
Chocking us with aggravation. Who needs it? The aggravation the daily goddam hassle.
It's a bummer, who gives a dam?
Bumper to bumper in the traffic jam.
Clench your jaw, getting all up tight
Breathing fumes, stuck in a tin can,
Trapped, trapped.
Hate, frustration, no escape.
Glaring eyes all filled with hate.
Arteries throb, coronaries pound
Aggravation all around.
Like wildfire it spreads through the nation
Choking us with aggravation.
They won the peace, we lost the war.
So what are we still fighting for?
The highway's blocked, is this my end
To follow a Mercedes Benz?
Hey, Mitzibushi and Toyota, who said that the war was over?
Aggravations everywhere, get outta my way get out of my hair.
Another jam, another day, another hair is turning grey,
I wanna scream, I wanna say,
Get outta my hair, get out of my way
Who needs it? Aggravation, aggravation
Had enough of all this aggravation,
Tension choking up blocking my circulation.
I've had enough, I've had enough of all this aggravation.
While traffic jams and tempers break,
The city streets are full of hate,
The lights are red, it's all too late.
How much can a poor man take? Aggravation in my mind my body and my soul
There's no solution to it all, it's out of control.
Out of control.
Is it my imagination, am I seeing what is true?
If we are living in damnation,
I'd live in hell to be with you, what more can I do? I gotta violent streak caused by
We're getting uptight, wanna fight, everybody back bite
Now we can't turn back the future's bleak,
I gotta mean appetite,
I gotta get my daily fill of aggravation.
Don't push 'cos I'm really pumped,
I'm ready when you are, punk. So step aside, unless your dumb,
I'm all wound up with aggravation. Had enough of all this aggravation
Winding up, stress filled, mad intimidation.
And it touches all the passers-by.
As dog eats dog to stay alive,
Then moves on through the population,
Till there's mass contamination.
With violent streets all filled with fear,
Pollution in the atmosphere,
The ozone's gone and that's no fun
I've had enough of this, old son
Who needs it? Aggravation.
And I don't have any answers
I just got an attitude,
Do what it takes just to survive it,
Another day but I'll get through,
What more can I do? Hey, I never met a girl like you before
Yeah, I never met a girl like you before
Girls like you are very hard to find Hey, I never met a girl that I could miss
Yeah, I never met a girl that I could kiss
Girls like you are very hard to find When I kiss you
I kiss your lovely lips
When I hold you
You got one hand I want to hold Girl, I never met a girl like you before
Yeah, I never met a girl like you before
Girls like you are very hard to find Hey, I never met a girl like you before
Yeah, I never met a girl like you before
Girls like you are very hard to find To find, to find, to find, you're mine So tired, tired of waiting
So tired, tired of waiting

I had nobody till I met you
But you, keeping me waiting, all of the time
What can I do? It's your life and you can do what you want
Do what you like
But please don't keep me waiting
Please don't keep me waiting 'Coz I'm so tired, tired of waiting
I'm so tired, tired of waiting I was a lonely soul

Please don't keep me waiting 'Coz I'm so tired, tired of waiting
I'm so tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you, for you, for you Well I met a pretty girl, as pretty as can be
I thought she was my baby till she introduced to me
A great big tall fella, about six foot tall
I shivered and I shook, couldn't do any more 'Cause I'm a lover not a fighter
Yes, I'm a lover not a fighter
Yes, I'm a lover not a fighter
And I'm really built for speed
Built for speed Well, some people think I'm lazy but there's one thing they don't know
'Cause when I'm in the mood I can go cat go 'Cause I'm a lover not a fighter
Yes, I'm a lover not a fighter
Yes, I'm a lover not a fighter
And I'm really built for speed
Built for speed
Built for speed
Whoa yeah Well I can roar like a lion, I can sting like a bee
But some times I think, baby, I've got rabbit spunk in me 'Cause I'm a lover not a fighter
Yes, I'm a lover not a fighter
Yes, I'm a lover not a fighter
And I'm really built for speed
Built for speed
Built for speed
Whoa yeah Everybody's going somewhere
See how they stand in line
All complaining their lives are unfair
Too bad for them, too bad for mine (It's the killing time) From now till then
(Killing time), Not knowing when They're watching me, I'm watching them
Standing by the empty mine
(Killing time) It's a killing time
I know it well
Killing time
Until the bell
Too late to change, too soon to tell
And in between, the killing time
(Killing time) Giving me hell Up above the stars still shine
Through the poverty and grime
Of the empty streets below
Killing time, nowhere to go
(Killing time) Tell me, brother what's the plan?
Will I be a working man?
And occupy my idle mind
Or kill the time I knew so well
(Killing time) Giving me hell Still I can smile at what I see
Soap operas full of vanity
So much wealth and property
Side by side with petty crime Is that all life's meant to be?
Commercials full of luxuries
A man has one, a cat has nine
And in between it's killing time
(Killing time) It's a killing time
I know it well
Too late to change
Too soon to tell Still I can smile at what I find
Waiting round and killing time
Bite the bullet
Help me through it
These lunatics will take my mind
Why can't life be more sublime
Than all of this waste and killing time Killing time
I know it well
It's the killing time See your face everywhere,
Giving you all my life,
All I own is for you. There's a fire, a fire burning in my heart,
Can't deny it, a fire burning in my heart for you.
A fire burning in my heart. It only goes to show,
The world is full of miracles,
I thought I'd never know. Touch my soul with your light,
Freeing me of all doubt,
Of all fear, here in me. There's a fire, a fire burning in my heart,
Can't deny it, a fire burning in my heart for you. Fire, a fire burning in my heart,
A fire burning in my heart for you. There's a fire, a fire burning in my heart. Woke up this morning, started to sneeze
Had a cigarette and a cup of tea
I looked in the mirror, what did I see?
A nine stone weakling with knobbly knees I did my knees bend, press ups, touch my toes
Had another sneeze and I blew my nose
I looked in the mirror at my pigeon chest
I had to put on my clothes because it made me depressed Surely there must be a way
For me to change the shape I'm in
Dissatisfied is what I am
I want to be a better man Superman, Superman
Wish I could fly like Superman
Superman, Superman
I want to be like Superman
Ohh! I want to be like Superman
Superman, Superman
Wish I could fly like Superman Woke up this morning, what did I see?
A big black cloud hanging over me
I switched on the radio and nearly dropped dead
The news was so bad that I fell out of bed There was a gas strike, oil strike, lorry strike, a bread strike
Got to be a Superman to survive
Gas bills, rent bills, tax bills, phone bills
I'm such a wreck but I'm staying alive I'd really like to change the world
And save it from the mess it's in
I'm too weak, I'm so thin
I'd like to fly, but I can't even swim
Ohh! Superman, Superman
Wish I could be like Superman
Superman, Superman
I want to fly like Superman Superman, Superman
Wish I could fly like Superman
Superman, Superman
Wish I could hang out with Superman Look in the paper, what do I see?
Robbery, violence, insanity
Hey girl, we've got to get out of this place
There's got to be something better than this
I need you, but I hate to see you this way
If I were Superman, then we'd fly away
Ohhh! Superman, Superman

Till the end of the day
Till the end of the day
Till the end of the day
Till the end of the day The sky is blue but there are clouds in my head,
With big decisions looming ahead.
The sun is out but the room is so grey,
So much confusion headed my way.
Get positive, try to be gay. News of the world, tea and biscuits in bed.
The headlines said that Diana is dead.
She couldn't act much but she put on a show.
She always smiled even when she felt low.
I used to fancy her a long time ago. So today has got to be a good day,
Today is gonna be a good day,
Today is gonna be a good day,
Good day, good day, good day. Holes in my socks and I can't find my shoes.
It's no surprise that I'm singing the blues.
So many holes in my life still to mend,
And someone just said that the world's gonna end. So today better be a good day,
Today is gonna be a good day,
Today has got to be a good day,
Good day, good day, good day, good day. If we blow away the past with a bloody great blast,
Make it fast, make it fast.
So have a good day today because it could be your last,
Make it last, make it last. Will it light up the sky?
Will it blot out the sun?
Well we've waited this long,
So it better be a good one.
Good day, good day, good day. Yeah, it's gonna be a good day.
Hey baby, if you come back home it'll be a good day today.
They could drop a small atom bomb on the city today,
But if you walk through that door honey, you know it'll be a good day. And now survival is my only aim.
I call friends and see if any remain.
Who was that girl who used to be my flame?
I'd call her if I could remember her name. So today is gonna be a good day,
Today has got to be a good day,
Today is gonna be a good day,
Good day, good day, good day, good day. Hey Diana, I've really got to learn to take a tip from you,
Put on my makeup and try to make the world take notice of you.
Yeah, it's gonna be good day today. Good day, gonna be a good day.
(repeat) My makeup is dry and it cracks 'round my chin
I'm drowning my sorrows in whisky and gin
The lion tamer's whip doesn't crack anymore
The lions they won't bite and the tigers won't roar La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
So let's all drink to the death of a clown
Won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Let's all drink to the death of a clown The old fortune teller lies dead on the floor
Nobody needs fortunes told anymore
The trainer of insects is crouched on his knees
And frantically looking for runaway fleas La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
So won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la Well, lived my life and never stopped to worry 'bout a thing
Opened up and shouted out and never tried to sing
Wondering if I'd done wrong
Will this depression last for long? Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?
Well, once we had an easy ride and always felt the same Time was on our side and I had everything to gain
Let it be like yesterday
Please let me have happy days
Won't you tell me Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?
Ma and Pa look back at all the things they used to do
Didn't have no money and they always told the truth Daddy didn't have no toys
And mummy didn't need no boys
Won't you tell me Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?
Well, yesterday was such an easy game for you to play
But let's face it things are so much easier today Guess you need some bringing down
And get your feet back on the ground
Won't you tell me Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone?
Where have all the good times gone? Here's wishing you the bluest sky
And hoping something better comes tomorrow
Hoping all the verses rhyme
And the very best of choruses to
Follow all the doubt and sadness
I know that better things are on the way Here's hoping all the days ahead
Won't be as bitter as the ones behind you
Be an optimist instead
And somehow happiness will find you
Forget what happened yesterday
I know that better things are on the way It's really good to see you rocking out and having fun
Living like you just begun
Accept your life and what it brings
I hope tomorrow you'll find better things
I know tomorrow you'll find better things Here's wishing you the bluest sky
And hoping something better comes tomorrow
Hoping all the verses rhyme
And the very best of choruses to
Follow all the doubt and sadness
I know that better things are on the way I know you've got a lot of good things happening up ahead
The past is gone, it's all been said
So here's to what the future brings
I know tomorrow you'll find better things
I know tomorrow you'll find better things
I hope tomorrow you'll find better things
I know tomorrow you'll find better things
I hope tomorrow you'll find better things Look at us here today
Lots of talking with nothing to say
And if I seem somewhat vague
It's because I'm somewhat afraid
I'm surviving, that's all I am
I'm surviving to be a better man
I'm surviving, that's my plan
Just surviving Yesterday, I was sure
But today I don't know anymore
Thought I was brave till I saw
My frightened reflection in a dark corridor
Now I'm surviving to be a better man
I'm surviving with an emotional plan
I'm surviving, so please understand
I'm surviving, surviving There are millions of people out there
Trying to get by in a world that don't care
People smiling through clouds of despair
Protecting the wounds until they repair
They're surviving the best way they can
They are surviving every woman and man
Just surviving with an emotion plan
So keep surviving Maybe it's my shattered pride
That's why I get scared of emotional ties
Don't let them in, otherwise
You'll smile like a fool
But you'll be hurting inside
So I'm surviving through the insecurity
I am surviving, I got hope inside of me
So I'm smiling through all the insanity
I'm surviving, surviving I was moved by the way that you said
Don't be afraid, I won't leave you for dead
You took my soul and mixed up my head
You left me alive
You should have killed me instead
Now I'm surviving, that's all I am
I'm surviving to be a better man
I'm surviving, that's my plan
I'm surviving, surviving
Surviving My big day, it was the biggest day of my life.
It was the summit of my long career,
But I felt so down, and I drank too much beer,
The management said that I shouldn't appear.
I walked out onto the stage and started to speak.
The first night I've missed for a couple of years,
I explained to the crowed and they started to jeer,
And just when I wanted no one to be there,
All of my friends were there.
Not just my friends, but their best friends too.
All of my friends were there to stand and stare,
Say what they may, all of their friends need not stay.
Those who laughed were not friends anyway.
All of my friends were there to stand and stare. Days went by, I walked around dressed in a disguise.
I wore a mustache and I parted my hair,
And gave the impression that I did not care,
But oh, the embarrassment, oh, the dispair.
Came the day, helped with a few large glasses of gin,
I nervously mounted the stage once again,
Got through my performance and no one complained,
Thank God I can go back to normal again.
I went to that old cafe,
Where I had been in much happier days,
And all of my friends were there,
And no one cared.
Say what they may, all of my friends were there.
Not just my friends, but their best friends too.
All of my friends were there,
Now I don't care. This is the age of machinery,
A mechanical nightmare,
The wonderful world of technology,
Napalm hydrogen bombs biological warfare, This is the twentieth century,
But too much aggravation
It's the age of insanity,
What has become of the green pleasant fields of Jerusalem. Ain't got no ambition, I'm just disillusioned
I'm a twentieth century man but I don't wanna be here.
My mama said she can't understand me
She can't see my motivation
Just give me some security,
I'm a paranoid schizoid product of the twentieth century. You keep all your smart modern writers
Give me William Shakespeare
You keep all your smart modern painters
I'll take Rembrandt, Titian, Da Vinci and Gainsborough, Girl we gotta get out of here
We gotta find a solution
I'm a twentieth century man but I don't want to die here. I was born in a welfare state
Ruled by bureaucracy
Controlled by civil servants
And people dressed in grey
Got no privacy got no liberty
Cos the twentieth century people
Took it all away from me. Don't wanna get myself shot down
By some trigger happy policeman,
Gotta keep a hold on my sanity
I'm a twentieth century man but I don't wanna die here. My mama says she can't understand me
She can't see my motivation
Ain't got no security,
I'm a twentieth century man but I don't wanna be here. This is the twentieth century
But too much aggravation
This is the edge of insanity
I'm a twentieth century man but I don't wanna be here I remember, when you were down
And you needed a helping hand
I came to feed you but now that I need you
You won't give me a second glance Now I'm calling all citizens from all over the world

On a spaceship somewhere sailing across an empty sea
This time tomorrow what will we know
Well we still be here watching an in-flight movie show I'll leave the sun behind me and watch the clouds as they sadly pass me by
Seven miles below me I can see the world and it ain't so big at all This time tomorrow what will we see
Fields full of houses, endless rows of crowded streets
I don't know where I'm going, I don't want to see
I feel the world below me looking up at me Leave the sun behind me and watch the clouds as they sadly pass me by
And I'm in perpetual motion and the world below doesn't matter much to me This time tomorrow where will we be
On a spaceship somewhere sailing across an empty sea
This time tomorrow, this time tomorrow Man made the buildings that reach for the sky
And man made the motorcar and learned how to drive
But he didn't make the flowers and he didn't make the trees
And he didn't make you and he didn't make me And he's got no right to turn us into machines
No, he's got no right at all 'cause we are all God's children
And he got no right to change us
Oh, we gotta go back the way the good Lord made us all I don't want this world to change me
I wanna go back the way the good Lord made me
Same lungs that He gave me to breath with
Same eyes He gave me to see with Oh, the rich man, the poor man, the saint and the sinner
The wise man, the simpleton, the loser and the winner
We are all the same to Him
Stripped of our clothes and all the things we own The day that we are born
We are all God's children
And they got no right to change us
Oh, we gotta go back, the way the good Lord made Oh, the good Lord made us all
And we are all His children
And they got no right to change us
Oh, we gotta go back, the way the good Lord made us all
Yeah, we gotta go back, the way the good Lord made us all I need you,
I need you more than birds need the sky
I need you,
It's true little girl
That you can lift these tears from my eyes (chorus)
But if you ever tell me goodbye
I'll break down and you'll hear me cry...
I need you
More than anybody else has needed anyone before I need you,
There's no-one else to stand in your place
I need you,
You know little girl
That you can keep a smile on my face (chorus) (instrumental) I need you,
There's no-one else to stand in your place

Oh, set me free In a deep dark jungle long time ago
Lived a lonesome caveman
He was a solitary soul
And he spent his playtime
Chewing meat from bones.
He didn't know how to talk much
He only knew how to groan
Then he lifted up his hands and reached to the sky
Let out a yell and no one replied.
Frustration and torment tore him inside
Then he fell to the ground and he cried and he cried.
But then education saved the day.
He learned to speak and communicate
Education saved the day.
He thanked God for the friends he made.
'Cos everybody needs an education
Everybody needs an education.
Black skin, red skin, yellow or white,
Everybody needs to read and write
Everybody needs an education. Thank the day when that primitive man
Learned to talk with his brothers
And live off the land.
He left his cave and he moved far away
And he lived with his friends in a house that they'd made
He learned to think and to work with his brain
And he astounded his friends with all the knowledge he gained He wrote it down on a rock that he found
And he showed all his friends and they passed it around
And then education came that day.
The day it came was a sacred day.
Education came that day
He thanked God for the friends he'd made. Well man built a boat and he learned how to sail
And he travelled far and wide
Then he looked up above saw the stars in the sky
So he learned how to fly.
Thanks to all the mathematicians
And the inventors with their high I.Q.s
And the professors in their colleges
Trying to feed me knowledge
That I know I'll never use.
Thank you sir for the millions of words
That you've handed me down and you've told me to learn But I've got words in my ears and my eyes
I've got so many facts that I must memorize
Because education's doing me in
I want to stop but my head's in a swim
Education drives me insane
I can't recall all the facts on my brain.
Education came that day
The day it came was a sacred day
Education saved the day
He thanked God for all the friends he made. Teacher, teach me how to read and write,
You can teach me about biology,
But you can't tell me what I am living for
'Cos that's still a mystery.
Teacher, teach me about nuclear physics
And teach me about the structure of man,
But all your endless calculations
Can't tell me why I am.
No you can't tell me why I am,
No you can't tell me why I am. Everybody needs education,
Open Universities, education.
Every race every creed, education.
And every little half-breed, education.
Every nationality, education.
All the little people need education.
Eskimos and pygmies need
And even aborigines, education. Well physics and geography, education.
Philosophy and history, education.
Science and biology, education,
Geometry and poetry, education.
Well, education, education, education, education (Repeat 'education' till end) Cheap is small and not too steep
But best of all cheap is cheap
Circumstance has forced my hand
To be a cut price person in a low budget land
Times are hard but we'll all survive
I just got to learn to economize I'm on a low budget
I'm on a low budget
I'm not cheap, you understand
I'm just a cut price person in a low budget land
Excuse my shoes they don't quite fit
They're a special offer and they hurt me a bit
Even my trousers are giving me pain
They were reduced in a sale so I shouldn't complain
They squeeze me so tight so I can't take no more
They're size 28 but I take 34 I'm on a low budget
What did you say
I'm on a low budget
I thought you said that I'm on a low budget
I'm a cut price person in a low budget land I'm shopping at Woolworth and low discount stores
I'm dropping my standards so that I can buy more (Quality costs, but quality wastes,
So I'm giving up all of my expensive tastes.
Caviar and champagne are definite no's,
I'm acquiring a taste for brown ale and cod roes ) Low budget sure keeps me on my toes
I count every penny and I watch where it goes
We're all on our uppers we're all going skint
I used to smoke cigars but now I suck polo mints I'm on a low budget
What did you say
Yea I'm on a low budget
I thought you said that
I'm on a low budget
I'm a cut price person in a low budget land
I'm on a low budget
Low budget
Low budget Art takes time, time is money
Money's scarce and that ain't funny
Millionaires are things of the past
We're in a low budget film where nothing can last
Money's rare there's none to be found
So don't think I'm tight if I don't buy a round I'm on a low budget
What did you say
Yes I'm on a low budget
I thought you said that
I'm on a low budget
I'm a cut price person in a low budget land
I'm on a low budget
Say it again
Low budget
One more time
Low budget (I look like a tramp, but don't write me off,
I'll have you all know, I was once a toff
At least my hair is all mine, my teeth are my own,
But everything else is on permanent loan.
Once all my clothes were made by hand,
Now I'm a cut price person in a low budget land.
I'm on a low budget
I'll have you all know
We're on a low budget
I'm on a low budget) The Star is in Norman's office. His day
of sweat and toil has begun. 
Nine To Five Answering phones and dictating letters
Making decisions that affect no one.
Stuck in the office from nine until five
Life is so incredibly dull,
Working from nine to five. Oh nine to five, nine to five,
Working from nine to five. And time goes by
The hours tick away.
First seconds,
Then minutes,
Then hours into days.
Each day,
Each week,
Seems just like any other.
All work,
No play,
It's just another day. He's caught in a mass of computerised trivia,
Deciphering data for mechanical minds.
He's lost in the paperwork and up to his eyes,
He's checking a list that's been checked out before
And he's starting to lose his mind. Oh nine to five, nine to five,
Working from nine to five.
(repeat). This world is big and wild and half insane
Take me where real animals are playing
Just a dirty old shack
Where the hound dogs bark
That we called our home
I want to be back there
Among the cats and dogs
And the pigs and the goats
On Animal Farm
My animal home
On Animal Farm
My animal home While I lay my head upon my pillow
Little girl, come play beneath my window
Though she's far from home
She is free from harm
And she need not fear
She is by my side
And the sky is wide
So let the sun shine bright
On Animal Farm
My animal home
On Animal Farm
My animal home Girl, It's a hard, hard world, if it gets you down
Dreams often fade and die in a bad, bad world
I'll take you where real animals are playing
And people are real people not just playing
It's a quiet, quiet life
By a dirty old shack
That we called our home
I want to be back there
Among the cats and dogs
And the pigs and the goats
On Animal Farm
My animal home
On Animal Farm
My animal home
On Animal Farm
Animal Farm Standing in the middle of nowhere,
Wondering how to begin.
Lost between tomorrow and yesterday,
Between now and then. And now we're back where we started,
Here we go round again.
Day after day I get up and I say
I better do it again. Where are all the people going?
Round and round till we reach the end.
One day leading to another,
Get up, go out, do it again. Then it's back where you started,
Here we go round again.
Back where you started,
Come on do it again. And you think today is going to be better,
Change the world and do it again.
Give it all up and start all over,
You say you will but you don't know when. Then it's back where you started,
Here we go round again.
Day after day I get up and I say
Come on do it again. The days go by and you wish you were a different guy,
Different friends and a new set of clothes.
You make alterations and affect a new pose,
A new house, a new car, a new job, a new nose.
But it's superficial and it's only skin deep,
Because the voices in your head keep shouting in your sleep.
Get back, get back. Back where you started, here we go round again,
Back where you started, come on do it again. Back where you started, here we go round again,
Day after day I get up and I say, do it again.
Do it again.
Day after day I get up and I say, come on do it again. Met a girl, fell in love, glad as I can be
Met a girl, fell in love, glad as I can be
But I think all the time, is she true to me?
'Cause there's nothing in this world to stop me worryin' 'bout that girl I found out I was wrong, she was just two timing
I found out I was wrong, she just kept on lying
Now she tries to tell the truth, and I just can't believe
'Cause there's nothing in this world to stop me worryin' 'bout that girl Tell me who can I turn to, just who can I believe?
Tried to put her out of my mind, she'll only cause me grief
I love that girl, whatever she's done, you know it hurts me deeply
'Cause there's nothing in this world to stop me worryin' 'bout that girl I know she's been with other fellas, why does she keep on lying?
It hurts me so when she says nothing, I really feel like dying
I ache inside until I think[?], I know it's just my pride
'Cause there's nothing in this world to stop me worryin' 'bout that girl
'Cause there's nothing in this world to stop me worryin' 'bout that girl Picture yourself when you're getting old

Yeah, yeah, yeah Standing by the elevator
Feeling gloomy and down
Waiting for the flashing light
To lift me up from the ground
Then the elevator opened
And I saw her standing there
She had to be a young executive
She looked so corporate and clean
And I thought I'd seen her somewhere before
On the cover of a magazine
I didn't think she'd even look at me
Or bother to glance my way
But she actually smiled at me and said
Hi-ya handsome, have a good day Chorus:
I must be dreaming if she looks at me
I gotta be dreaming, is it a fantasy
Now I've got positive emotions
Buzzing 'round every molecule in me
I gotta be dreaming, is it reality
But over and over I live that memory
Was it real or only a dream
La la la la Was it my imagination playing tricks on me
When she looked my way
Maybe she took me for somebody else
Whatever it was, it made my day, hey hey I wake up in the morning
Smiling with anticipation
Suddenly I feel alive
Face the world with expectation
I must be dreaming this world is a better place
Was my imagination playing tricks on me
Was it real or only a dream?
I see a great big sunset
Where only clouds used to be
Was it all an illusion, is it fantasy
If it's just a dream
It's good enough for me, yeah yeah Waiting by the elevator
Feeling optimistic and keen
Waiting for my executive goddess
to appear as if in a dream
Then the elevator opened
She was talking to another guy
And I tried to say hello to her
But I failed to even catch her eye
Then everybody crowded inside
And I sadly stood my ground
Thinking life's just like that elevator
It takes you up and brings you down Chorus Was it only an illusion
Was it real or only a dream Chorus Woke up in a panic,
Like somebody fired a gun
I wish I could be dreaming,
But the nightmare's just begun.
There's flooding in the basement,
There's water all around.
There's woodworm in the attic
And the ceiling just fell down.
I'm in a state (state)
Of confusion (whooooh).
I'm in a state (state)
Of confusion (whooooh). All the dirty dishes
Are still in the kitchen sink.
The tumble dryer's broken,
Now the telly's on the blink.
My girlfriend's packed her bags
And moved out to another town.
She couldn't stand the boredom
When the video broke down.
Don't know why I feel so bad.
Is it the weather, or am I going mad?
Don't know why I feel this way.
I don't know whether I'm coming or I'm going,
Can't cover up 'cause it's obviously showing.
It's a state (state)
Of confusion (whooooh).
We're in a state (state)
Of confusion (whooooh).
I don't know whether I'm coming or I'm going. Should feel happy, should feel glad.
I'm alive and it can't be bad,
But back on planet Earth they shatter the illusion,
The world's going 'round in a state of confusion. Standing on an island
In the middle of the road.
Traffic either side of me,
Which way will I go?
I should've stayed at home,
I should have never come outside.
Now I wish I never tried
To cross the other side.
I'm in a state (state)
State of confusion (whooooh).
It's a state (state)
Of confusion (whooooh). Lyin' awake in a cold, cold sweat,
Am I overdrawn, am I going in debt?
It gets worse, the older that you get.
No escape from the state of confusion I'm in.
State of confusion I'm in.
Whooooh Who'll be the next in line?
Who'll be the next in line for heartache?
Who'll make the same mistakes I made over you? Who'll be the next in line?
Who'll be the next in line?
For you? Who'll be the next in line?
Who'll be the next to watch your love fade?
All your affections finally fade away. There'll be no use in sighing.
Who'll be the next in line?
For you? One day you'll find out when I'm gone,
I was the best one you had,
I was the one who gave you love. Who'll be the next in line?
Who'll be the next in line for heartaches?
Who'll make the same mistakes I made over you? There'll be no use in sighing.
Who'll be the next in line?
For you? One day you'll find out when I'm gone,
I was the best one you had,
I was the one who gave you love. Who'll be the next in line?
Who'll be the next in line for heartaches?
Who'll make the same mistakes I made over you? Who'll be the next in line?
Who'll be the next in line?
For you?
For you? Come on love
Let's forget about all the things that we've done wrong
Just remember all of the things that we've done right
I'm in no mood to argue and I'm in no mood to fight
So let the tears pass you by
Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry
And I ain't gonna let this big world get me down
I gotta learn to keep a hold of my head and keep my feet on the ground
Moments of ecstatic happiness
And the moments of stress that we had better forget
But love, I gotta feeling that I've said it all before
I said it before
I say I'll never do you wrong but then I go and do the same again
I don't know why, don't know why
Don't know why, don't know why, don't know why
We gotta learn to share these moments in our lives
And never let it get us down, we gotta put up a fight
Moments to remember all our lives
From the first brief hello to the last good-bye I say I'll never do you wrong but then I go and do the same again
I don't know why, don't know why
Don't know why, don't know why, don't know why
We gotta learn to share these moments in our lives
And never let it get us down, we gotta put up a fight
Moments to remember all our lives
From the first brief hello to the last good-bye I'll have some clam chowder, followed by beef steak on rye
Pumpkin pie, whipped cream and coffee,
I wanna green salad on the side,
Don't forget the french fries,
Pizza pie, garlic and anchovie.
I keep burning up calories as fast as I keep putting them down,
Eat food, put it in my mouth,
Chew it up, swallow it down,
I'll have two eggs, over light, home made apple pie
Cole slaw as a side order.
I gotta stay fit, stay alive, eat food to sustain a non-stop high-grade performer.
The pace is continual, sure keeps running me down
Don't you know that you gotta eat food,
Don't you know that you gotta refuel.
I'm a Maximum Consumption, super-grade performer.
High powered machine,
Go steady on my clutch, go easy on the hills
And you'll get a lot of mileage out of me.
I'm so easy to drive, and I'm an excellent ride,
Excessive living sure keeps running me down
You've got to learn to use the Maximum Juice
That's how you get the maximum use.
Life keeps using me, keeps on abusing me, mentally and physically.
I gotta stay fit, stay alive, need fuel inside, eat food to survive
Maximum Consumption sure keeps running me down
Don't you know that you gotta eat food
Don't you know that it's good for you.
I'm a Maximum Consumption,
Non-stop machine
Total automation perpetual motion. Under a lamp light
Monica stands at midnight,
And every guy think he can buy her love,
But money can't buy sweet lovin' from Monica. Morning to moonshine,
Monica knows every line.
Don't ever propose 'cause Monica knows, you know.
She'll turn up her nose and say what a fool you are. I, I shall die,
I, I shall die if I should lose Monica.
(Oh Monica my love.)
People can try,
People can try, but they can't buy Monica, my love. You take the sunshine,
I'll take the nightly shadows.
'Cause everyone knows that Monica glows at night.
She'll do something wrong and prove to you she is right. I, I shall die,
I, I shall die if I should lose Monica.
(Oh Monica my love.)
People may try,
People may try, but they can't buy Monica, my love. Morning to moonshine,
Monica knows every line.
Don't ever propose 'cause Monica knows, you know.
She'll turn up her nose and say what a fool you are.
Monica. I gotta go now, gotta go now
I gotta go now, gotta go now
Hey, little girl
I've gotta go now.
Hey, little girl.
I've gotta go now.
Well your mum,
She's so angry
Hey, little girl,
Guess I'd better go now.
Hey, little girl.
What'cha gonna do 'bout it now?
Hey, little girl.
What'cha gonna do 'bout it now?
Well I love you,
But I guess I'd better go now.
Hey, little girl,
Guess I'd better go now.
I gotta go now, gotta go now 
I gotta go now, gotta go now
I don't want to leave you
But I guess I'd better go now.
Soon we'll be together all the time
But until then I gotta go, gotta go.
I gotta go now, gotta go now
I gotta go now, gotta go now
Hey, little girl,
I gotta go now, gotta go now
Hey, little girl,
I gotta go now, gotta go now
Well I love you,
But I guess I'd better go now.
Hey, little girl,
Guess I'd better go now.
I gotta go now, gotta go now
I gotta go now, gotta go now
I've gotta go. I don't wanna get left behind
Gonna love my baby all the time
If I don't wanna get left alone
I gotta move on down my baby's home
And if my baby isn't there
I'm gonna fill my gap and comb my hair
Gotta move, gotta move
Gotta move, gotta move All my life I've had to move
Always failed to stay in school
As I move down this very long road
Sometimes I wished I'd stayed at home
Where I'm going no one knows
Only know I gotta go
You gotta move, gotta move
Gotta move, gotta move I don't wanna get left behind
Gonna love my baby all the time
If I don't wanna get left alone
I gotta move on down my baby's home
And if baby isn't there
I'm gonna brush my boots and comb my hair
I gotta move, gotta move
I gotta move, gotta move Just sitting down by the riverside,
Spreading my arms to the open wide.
Now I am free and the world's at my feet.
I can close my eyes. Oh Love, keep me warm, keep me satisfied.
Please keep me calm, keep me pacified.
Now I'm content and my life is complete.
I can close my eyes. Sitting by the riverside with you. I love sitting down by the riverside,
Watching the water go flowing by.
Oh, golly gee, it is heaven to be
Like a willow tree. Spend my time just drinking wine while looking at the view My bags are packed, I guess it's time for me to go.
I can't say where I'm headed, 'cause I just don't know.
When I think of what I'll be losing,
It's hard to move along,
But it's harder just to stay here,
Knowing that I don't belong. I'll be in touch, don't worry, I'll be calling you.
I've got no plans, I'm not sure where I'm going to.
It's hard to keep from crying,
After all that we've been through.
I've taken everything I need,
Now all that's left belongs to you. You take the photographs, the ones of you and me,
When we both posed and laughed to please the family.
Nobody noticed then we wanted to be free,
And now there's no more love,
It's just the property. It's hard to keep from crying,
After all that we've been through. Now that it's all over, now that you and I are free,
Now there's nothing left except the bit of property.
Started off with nothing, started off just you and me,
Now that it's all over you can keep the property. And all the little gifts we thought we'd throw away,
The useless souvenirs bought on a holiday.
We put them on a shelf, now they're collecting dust.
We never needed them, but they outlasted us. You go down the pub
You wear make up
And old dads trousers
Why don't you tidy up
You talk like a docker but you act like a queer
You drink champagne then complain it's too dear
You try so hard not to follow any trends
Then you cry in your beer and say you've got no friends
But is it any wonder that you've got no friends
But it's not the make up
Or the way you dress
It's not your appearance, that they all detest
It's not your manners, that you gotta improve
ooooo--it's your attitude. Chorus
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo
Your attitude
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo
Your attitude Take off your head phones
Hear what's going on
You can't live in a time zone
You've gotta move on
But before you get there
There's one thing you've gotta do
Oh change your attitude
It's your attitude
It's your attitude Chorus
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo
Your attitude
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo
Your attitude The '80s are here, I know cuz I'm staring right at them
But you're still waiting for 1960 to happen You might have the illness, but you've got the cure
You've got the answer, you will endure
You're the only person that's gonna pull you through
Ooh, with your attitude Chorus
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo
Your attitude
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo
Your attitude You gotta learn to be positive, it's your only chance
You mustn't be so defensive, you gotta join in the dance
But it isn't your dancing that you've gotta improve
Ooh, it's your attitude. Chorus
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo
Your attitude
Attitude, Oo Oo Oo
Your attitude It's all the music
It's all in your brain
You've used all the old licks
Now it's all gotta change.
Change your attitude
It's your attitude

Layin' 'cross the river, See my friends,
See my friends,
Layin' 'cross the river How well I remember my very first love affair
Those juvenile fantasies and innocent dreams we shared
But we're too blind to realize that we are totally unprepared
For the first time we fall in love
We think it's forever, the first time we fall in love
We always treasure the first time we fall in love
Those other romances come and go
But we cherish the memory of
The first time we fall in love First love can be such a strain
It can rule your head, it can bring you pain
And when it ends it seems such a shame
The first time we fall in love
Can make you sad, it can keep you awake
It can drive you mad
People say you're too young and it's only a fad
The first time we fall in love
The first time we fall in love The first time I fell out of love, it knocked me through the floor
My world came crashing down, it shook me to the core
I was unprepared 'cos I was only a kid
And I was much too young and I wasn't equipped
For the emotional pressures and stresses of it
But oh, I'll never forget
The way that she looked the first time we met
Time goes by but we never forget
The first time we fall in love Love can be exciting, it can be a bloody bore
Love can be a pleasure or nothing but a chore
Love can be like a dull routine
It can run you around till you're out of steam
It can treat you well, it can treat you mean
Love can mess you around
I can pick you up, it can bring you down
But they'll never know
The feelings we show
The first time we fall in love
The first time we fall in love I don't wanna leave, Bernadette,
But I don't wanna live with the jet set.
I don't wanna leave with you payin' all my debts,
With that alimony, palimony, whatever it is you get. Ooh, Bernadette, you are so expensive.
You've never done a day's work in your life,
You've got no incentive.
You've made a career out of punting off all of the men you've slept with.
Ooh, Bernadette, you are so expensive. I can't get a job, Bernadette,
So all that I can offer are a lot of bad debts
If you marry me, Bernadette,
You'll lose the alimony, palimony, whatever it is you get. Ooh, Bernadette, you are so expensive.
You've never done a day's work in your life,
You've got no incentive.
You've made a career out of punting off all of the men you've slept with.
Ooh, Bernadette, you are so expensive.
Ooh, Bernadette, Bernadette.
Ooh, Bernadette, Bernadette. (Bernadette's got a house in the country,
She's really got it made.
Her lawyers made her filthy rich,
She's got all expenses paid.) Maybe a famous rock star will fly you away,
Then you'll eat him all up,
And spit him out,
With a dash of Perrier. And when you've had enough
You'll throw him away,
And take him for all you can get.
Yeah, you like it don't you, Bernadette? I don't want to leave Bernadette,
But I wanna keep a little bit of self respect.
I don't want to leave with you paying all my debts,
With that alimony, palimony, whatever it is you get.
Ooh, Bernadette, you are so expensive.
You've never done a day's work in your life.
You've got no incentive.
Women like you oughta be locked up,
For giving others a bad name.
Ohh, Bernadette, you are so expensive.
Ooh, Bernadette, Bernadette.
Ooh, Bernadette. I think you're sad. All the stories have been told
Of kings and days of old
But there's no England now All the wars that were won and lost
Somehow don't seem to matter very much anymore
All the lies we were told
All the lies of the people running round
Their castles have burned
Now I see change
But inside we're the same as we ever were Living on a thin line
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin line
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin line
Living this way, each day is a dream
What am I, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin line
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do? Now another century nearly gone
What are we gonna leave for the young?
What we couldn't do, what we wouldn't do
It's a crime, but does it matter?
Does it matter much, does it matter much to you?
Does it ever really matter?
Yes, it really, really matters Living on a thin line
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin line
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do? Now another leader says
Break their hearts and break some heads
Is there nothing we can say or do?
Blame the future on the past
Always lost in blood and guts
And when they're gone, it's me and you Living on a thin line
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin line
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin line Hello you, hello me, hello people we used to be
Isn't it strange, we never changed
We've been through it all yet we're still the same
And I know it's a miracle, we still go, and for all we know
We might still have a way to go Hello me, hello you, you say you want out
Want to start anew, throw in your hand
Break up the band, start a new life, be a new man
But for all we know, we might still have a way to go
Before you go, there's something you ought to know There's a guy in my block, he lives for rock
He plays records day and night
And when he feels down, he puts some rock 'n' roll on
And it makes him feel alright
And when he feels the world is closing in
He turns his stereo way up high He just spends his life, living in a rock 'n' roll fantasy
He just spends his life, living on the edge of reality
He just spends his life, in a rock 'n' roll fantasy
He just spends his life, living in a rock 'n' roll fantasy 
He just spends his life, living on the edge of reality
He just spends his life, in a rock 'n' roll fantasy
He just spends his life, livingt in a rock 'n' roll fantasy Look at me, look at you
You say you've got nothing left to prove
The king is dead, rock is done
You might be through but I've just begun
I don't know, I feel free and I won't let go
Before you go, there's something you ought to know Dan is a fan and he lives for our music
It's the only thing that gets him by
He's watched us grow and he's seen all our shows
He's seen us low and he's seen us high
Oh, but you and me keep thinking
That the world's just passing us by Dont' want to spend my life, living in a rock 'n' roll fantasy
Don't want to spend my life living on the edge of reality
Don't want to waste my life, hiding away anymore
Don't want to spend my life, living in a rock 'n' roll fantasy... You've come a long way from the runny-nosed and scruffy kid I knew
You had such good ways
I can remember the little things that always made you smile
They made you happy
Now you think you're wiser because you're older
and you think
That money buys everything
And you think
that you need no one to guide you
But you're still a long way from home.
You've come a long way, you're self-assured and dressed in funny clothes
but you don't know me.
I hope you find what you are looking for
with your car and your handmade overcoats
But your wealth will never make you stronger
'cos you're still a long way from home
Yea, you're still a long way from home Hush little baby don't you cry
Soon the sun is going to shine
We're going to be free like the birds and the bees
Running wild in the big country
Got to be free to do what I want
Walk if I want, talk if I want
Got to be free to say what I want
Make what I want and play what I want
As free as the birds up in the sky
As free as the bugs and the spiders and flies
I don't know how but I'm gonna try
I've just got to be free
And it won't be long 'cos we're right
And they are wrong
We've got to get out of this world somehow
We've got to be free, we've got to be free now
Got to be free to laugh when I want
Think what I want and cry if I like
Got to be free to do what I want
Say what I want and swear if I like
As free as the sun and the moon in the sky
As free as a flea or a proud butterfly
I don't know how but I'm gonna try
I've just got to be free
Yeah, we've got to get out of this world somehow
We've got to be free, we've got to be free now
Got to be free to do what I want
Walk if I want and talk if I want
Got to be free to say what I want
Make what I want and play what I want
I've got to be proud and stand up straight
And let people see I ain't nobody's slave
I've got to be free before it's too late
I've just got to be free
Got to be free to do what I want
Walk if I want, talk if I want ah louie louie, oh no, saying we gotta go.

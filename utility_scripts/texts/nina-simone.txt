Love me, love me, love me, say you do
Let me fly away with you
For my love is like the wind
And wild is the wind Give me more than one caress
Satisfy this hungriness
Let the wind blow through your heart
For wild is the wind You touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me
With your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me
All things to me Don't you know you're life itself
Like a leaf clings to a tree
Oh my darling, cling to me
For we're creatures of the wind
And wild is the wind
So wild is the wind You touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me
With your kiss my life begins
Dady, you're spring to me
All things to me Don't you know you're life itself
Like a leaf clings to a tree
Oh my darling, cling to me
For we're creatures of the wind
And wild is the wind
So wild is the wind Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind I wish I knew how
It would feel to be free
I wish I could break
All the chains holdin' me
I wish I could say
All the things that I should say Say 'em loud, say 'em clear
For the whole 'round world to hear
I wish I could share
All the love that's in my heart
Remove all the thoughts
That keep us apart I wish you could know
What it means to be me
Then you'd see and agree
That every man should be free I wish I could give
All I'm longin' to give
I wish I could live
Like I'm longing to live
I wish I could do
All the things that I can do And though I'm way over due
I'd be startin' a new
Well I wish I could be
Like a bird in the sky
How sweet it would be
If I found I could fly I'd soar up to the sun
And look down at the sea
And I'd sing 'cause I know yeah And I'd sing 'cause I know yeah
And I'd sing 'cause I know
I'd know how it feels
I'd know how it feels to be free, yeah-yeah

When the fire is burning off
And the angels call my name
Dying love will leave no doubt
I'm the keeper of the flame Years have passed by
The spark still remains
True love can't die

When the fire is burning out
And the angels call my love
Dying love will leave no doubt

What the future has in store no one ever knows before
Yet we would all like the right to find the key to success
That elusive ray of light that will lead to happiness
Tomorrow is my turn
No more doubts no more fears
Tomorrow is my turn
When my luck is returning
All these years I've been learning to save fingers from burning
Tomorrow is my turn
No more doubts no more fears
Tomorrow is my turn to receive without giving
Make life worth living
Now it's my life I'm living
My only concern for tomorrow is my turn
Now the summer is gone, there's another to come
You can't stop years from drifting by even if you want to try
Though time may help you forget all that has happened before
But honey it's too late to regret what is gone will be no more
Tomorrow is my turn
When my luck is returning
All these years I've been learning to save fingers from burning
Tomorrow is my turn
No more doubts no more fears
Tomorrow is my turn to receive without giving
Make life worth living
Now it's my life I'm living
My only concern for tomorrow is my turn I put a spell on you

In my bowl. Lyrics to Mississippi Goddam!
Nina Simone, 1963 Mississippi Goddam (Nina Simone)
The name of this tune is Mississippi Goddam
And I mean every word of it Alabama's gotten me so upset
Tennessee made me lose my rest
And everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam Alabama's gotten me so upset
Tennessee made me lose my rest
And everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam Can't you see it
Can't you feel it
It's all in the air
I can't stand the pressure much longer
Somebody say a prayer Alabama's gotten me so upset
Tennessee made me lose my rest
And everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam This is a show tune
But the show hasn't been written for it, yet Hound dogs on my trail
School children sitting in jail
Black cat cross my path
I think every day's gonna be my last Lord have mercy on this land of mine
We all gonna get it in due time
I don't belong here
I don't belong there
I've even stopped believing in prayer Don't tell me
I tell you
Me and my people just about due
I've been there so I know
They keep on saying "Go slow!" But that's just the trouble
"do it slow"
Washing the windows
"do it slow"
Picking the cotton
"do it slow"
You're just plain rotten
"do it slow"
You're too damn lazy
"do it slow"
The thinking's crazy
"do it slow"
Where am I going
What am I doing
I don't know
I don't know Just try to do your very best
Stand up be counted with all the rest
For everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam I made you thought I was kiddin' Picket lines
School boy cots
They try to say it's a communist plot
All I want is equality
for my sister my brother my people and me Yes you lied to me all these years
You told me to wash and clean my ears
And talk real fine just like a lady
And you'd stop calling me Sister Sadie Oh but this whole country is full of lies
You're all gonna die and die like flies
I don't trust you any more
You keep on saying "Go slow!"
"Go slow!" But that's just the trouble
"do it slow"
Desegregation
"do it slow"
Mass participation
"do it slow"
Reunification
"do it slow"
Do things gradually
"do it slow"
But bring more tragedy
"do it slow"
Why don't you see it
Why don't you feel it
I don't know
I don't know You don't have to live next to me
Just give me my equality
Everybody knows about Mississippi
Everybody knows about Alabama
Everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam That's it! My baby don't care for shows

Il faut oublier
Tout peut s'oublier
Qui s'enfuit déjà
Oublier le temps
Des malentendus
Et le temps perdu
A savoir comment
Oublier ces heures
Qui tuaient parfois
A coups de pourquoi
Le coeur du bonheur Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas Moi je t'offrirai
Des perles de pluie
Venues de pays
Ou il ne pleut pas
Je creuserai la terre
Jusqu'après ma mort
Pour couvrir ton corps
D'or et de lumière
Je ferai un domaine
Ou l'amour sera roi
Ou l'amour sera loi
Ou tu seras reine Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas Je t'inventerai
Des mots insensés
Que tu comprendras
Je te parlerai
De ces amants-là
Qui ont vu deux fois
Leurs coeurs s'embraser
Je te raconterai
L'histoire de ce roi
Mort de n'avoir pas
Pu te rencontrer Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas On a vu souvent
Rejaillir le feu
De l'ancien volcan
Qu'on croyait trop vieux
Il est para'? t-il
Des terres brulées
Donnant plus de blé
Qu'un meilleur avril
Et quand vient le soir
Pour qu'un ciel flamboie
Le rouge et le noir
Ne s'épousent-ils pas Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas Ne me quitte pas
Je ne vais plus pleurer
Je ne vais plus parler
Je me cacherai là
A te regarder
Danser et sourire
Et à t'écouter
Chanter et puis rire
Laisse-moi devenir
L'ombre de ton ombre
L'ombre de ta main
L'ombre de ton chien
Ne me quitte pas

Breaking rocks and serving my time
Breaking rocks out here on the chain gang
Because they done convicted me of crime Hold it steady right there while I hit it
Well, reckon that ought to get it
Been working and working
But I still got so terribly far to go I committed crime Lord I needed
Crime of being hungry and poor
I left the grocery store man breathing
When they caught me robbing his store Hold it steady right there while I hit it
Well, reckon that ought to get it
Been working and working
But I still got so terribly far to go I heard the judge say five years
On chain-gang you gonna go
I heard the judge say five years labor
I heard my old man scream Lordy, no! Hold it right there while I hit it
Well, reckon that ought to get it
Been working and working
But I still got so terribly far to go Gonna see my sweet honey bee
Gonna break this chain off to run
I'm gonna lay down somewhere shady
Lord, I sure am hot in the sun Hold it right there while I hit it
Well, reckon that ought to get it
Been workin' and workin'
Been workin' and slavin'
An' workin' and workin'
But I still got so terribly far to go Herbert Sacker, Nina Simone Why you wanna fly Blackbird you ain't ever gonna fly
No place big enough for holding all the tears you're gonna cry
Cos your mama's name was lonely and your daddy's name was pain
And they call you little sorrow cos you'll never love again So why you wanna fly Blackbird you ain't ever gonna fly
You ani't got no one to hold you you ain't got no one to care
If you'd only understand dear nobody wants you anywhere
So why you wanna fly Blackbird you ain't ever gonna fly Bob Dylan I take
just like a woman
Yes I do
And I make love
just like a woman
and I ache
just like a woman
but I break
like a little girl Nobody here feels any pain
tonight as I stand inside the rain
And no one has to guess
that baby's got new clothes
Lately I see her ribbons and her bows
and the problems
from her curls REFRAIN
I take
just like a woman... It was raining from the first
and I was dying her of thirst
That's why I came here
and a long time's curse
and what's worse
is this pain in here
I can't stay in here
Ain't it clear
Ain't it clear I must admit
I believe it's time for me to quit
And until we meet again
bein' introduced as friends
please don't let on
that you knew me when
I was hungry
and it was your world REFRAIN
I take
just like a woman... 
Original lyric by Bob Dylan Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand here in the rain.
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls. She takes just like a woman.
She makes love just like a woman.
And then she aches just like a woman.
But she breaks just like a little girl. Queen Mary, she's my friend.
Yes I believe I'll go see her again.
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
'Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamines, and her pearls. She takes just like a woman.
She makes love just like a woman.
And then she aches just like a woman.
But she breaks just like a little girl. (break:)
It raining at first, and I was dying there of thirst,
So I came in here.
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse
Is this pain in here.
I can't stay in here.
Ain't it clear... That I just can't fit.
I believe it's time for us to quit.
But when we met again and are introduced as friends,
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry, and it was your world. You take just like a woman.
You make love just like a woman.
And then you ache just like a woman.
But you break just like a little girl. Baby you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Doncha know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood Ya know sometimes baby I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes it seems again that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood If I seem edgy
I want you to know
I never mean to take it out on you
Life has its problems
And I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do Caus' I love you
Oh baby
I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?
Sometimes I find myself alone regretting
Some little foolish thing
Some simple thing that I've done Caus' I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood Don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard
So please don't let me be misunderstood Pack up all my care and woe
Here I go, singing low
Bye bye blackbird Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet, so is he
Bye bye blackbird No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Make my bed and light the light
I'll arrive late tonight
Blackbird, bye bye No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Make my bed and light the light
I'll arrive late tonight
Blackbird, bye bye Traditional Black is the color of my true love's hair

is when you get your foot off our back Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me but I love you only

And then he stopped his play
And kneeled in a field of poppies. A man walked through my ghetto on a humid summer day
And then he stopped to pay and he dealed in a field of poppies. Oh, flower of forgetfulness, just an hour away to the moon
Take a deep breath if you are reaching for truth
While you're in the stupor
The door knocks and death takes another youth. Poppies, red poppies..., red poppies... A boy I used to know, a boy I used to know who's laughter rang to the skies
Was a joy to behold
Then I looked into his eyes, a look so cold, a boy who (rose on (? sorry))
In a field of poppies Poppies, red poppies, red poppies, red poppies..., red poppies...,
red poppies..., red poppies..., red poppies..., red poppies..., There is a balm in Gilead

To heal the sin-sick soul (1968) Randy Newman Broken windows and empty hallways
A pale dead moon in the sky streaked with gray
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles
With frozen smiles to chase love away
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today Lonely, lonely
Tin can at my feet
Think I'll kick it down the street
That's the way to treat a friend Bright before me the signs implore me
To help the needy and show them the way
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today (1966) Sandy Denny Across the evening sky, all the birds are leaving
But how can they know it's time for them to go?
Before the winter fire, I will still be dreaming
I have no thought of time For who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes? Sad, deserted shore, your fickle friends are leaving
Ah, but then you know it's time for them to go
But I will still be here, I have no thought of leaving
I do not count the time For who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes? And I am not alone while my love is near me
I know it will be so until it's time to go
So come the storms of winter and then the birds in spring again
I have no fear of time For who knows how my love grows?
And who knows where the time goes? All that I have is all that you've given me
(Ohhhh)
Did you never worry that I'd come to depend on you
(Ohhhh)
I gave you all the love I had in me
Now I find you lied and I cant believe its true
Oooh whoa oh
You better stop (Stop)
Before you tear me apart
You better stop (Stop)
Before you go and break my heart
Ooooh oooh oooh you better stop
Time after time I tried to walk away
But its not that easy
When you soul is torn in two
So I just resigned myself to it everyday yeh
And now all that I can do is to leave it up to you Ohhh
Ooh whoa oh
You better stop (Stop)
Before you tear me apart
You better stop (Stop)
Before you go and break my heart
Ooooh oooh oooh you better stop

They say every distance is not near

Of every man who put me here I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now any day now

They say every man must fall
so I swear I see my reflection
Somewhere inside these walls I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now any day now
I shall be released yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd
man who swears he's not to blame
ALl day long I hear him hollering so loud
just crying out that he's not to blame I see my light come shining

Bear strange fruit
Blood on the leaves
And blood at the roots
Black bodies
Swinging in the southern breeze
Strange fruit hangin'
From the poplar trees
Pastoral scene
Of the gallant south
Them big bulging eyes
And the twisted mouth
Scent of magnolia
Clean and fresh
Then the sudden smell
Of burnin' flesh
Here is a fruit
For the crows to pluck
For the rain to gather
For the wind to suck
For the sun to rot
For the leaves to drop
Here is
Strange and bitter crop 
As sung by Billie Holiday Southern trees bear strange fruit,
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root,
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze,
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees. Pastoral scene of the gallant south,
The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth,
Scent of magnolias, sweet and fresh,
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh. Here is fruit for the crows to pluck,
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck,
For the sun to rot, for the trees to drop,
Here is a strange and bitter cry. Suzanne takes you down to her place BY (near) the river
You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night FOREVER (beside her)
And you know that she's half crazy
AND (But) that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China
And just when you mean to tell her
That you have no love to give her
(then) She gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover
And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that she will trust you
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind. NOW (And) Jesus was a sailor
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching
From his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain
Only drowning men could see him
He said "All men will be sailors then
Until the sea shall free them"
But he himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
'CAUSE (And) you think maybe you('ll) CAN trust him
'CAUSE (For) he's touched your perfect body with his mind. Now Suzanne takes your hand
And she leads you to the river
She is wearing rags and feathers
From Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey
On our lady of the harbour
And she shows you where to look
BETWEEN (Among) the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning, LEANING out for love
And they will lean that way forever "Hello, oh yeah, I'm glad to see you, glad to see you. They tell me it's a full house it's full.
This is a good time to introduce you to the heart beat of our organization, the pulse of everything that we do: it centers around the drums and of course if you think about that really seriously you know that your entire life is centered around your heart beat, and that's rhythm is it not'
This song was ' eh 'I was told to sing by Miriam Makeba and she is my dear friend, and it is a prayer those of you who are fans of hers will remember this song." Westwind blow ye gentle

But I won't be blue always,
'Cause the sun's gonna shine
In my backdoor some day. I'm all alone at midnight
And my lamp is burnin' low
Ain't never had so much
Trouble in my life before. Trouble in mind, that's true
I have almost lost my mind,
Life ain't worth livin,
Sometimes I feel like dyin'. Goin' down to the river
Gonna take my ol' rockin' chair
And if the blues don't leave me
I'll rock away from there. You been a hard-hearted mama
Great God! You been unkind
Gonna be a cold, cold papa
Cause you to lose your mind. I'm gonna lay my head down
On some lonesome railroad line
And let the two nineteen
Pacify my mind. Well it's trouble, oh trouble
Trouble on my worried mind,
When you see me laughin'
I'm laughin' just to keep from cryin'. Sit there and count your fingers
What can you do?
Old girl you're through
Sit there, count your little fingers
Unhappy little girl blue Sit there and count the raindrops
Falling on you
It's time you knew
All you can ever count on
Are the raindrops
That fall on little girl blue Won't you just sit there
Count the little raindrops
Falling on you
'Cause it's time you knew
All you can ever count on
Are the raindrops
That fall on little girl blue No use old girl
You might as well surrender
'Cause your hopes are getting slender and slender
Why won't somebody send a tender blue boy
To cheer up little girl blue Everyone's gone to the moon Streets full of people, all alone
Roads full of houses, never home
A church full of singing, out of tune
Everyone's gone to the moon Eyes full of sorrow, never wet
Hands full of money, all in debt
Sun coming out in the middle of June
Everyone's gone to the moon You see a long time ago life had begun
Everyone went to the sun Parks full of motors, painted green
Mouths full of chocolate-covered cream
Arms that can only lift a spoon You see everyone's gone
Everybody's gone
Everyone's gone to the moon
Everyone's gone to the moon
What will happen now
Everyone's gone to the moon
There's nobody left
Everyone's gone to the moon Instrumental There's a new world commin'

Seven angels having the seven last plagues

And them that had gotten the victory over the beast
And over his image

stand on the sea of glass
with the harps of God all around them. There's a new world commin'

That we would live in France
We'd go boating on the Seine
And I would learn to dance We lived in Ohio then
He worked in the mines
On his dreams like boats
We knew we would sail in time All my sisters soon were gone
To Denver and Cheyenne
Marrying their grownup dreams
The lilacs and the man I stayed behind the youngest still
Only danced alone
The colors of my father's dreams
Faded without a sound And I live in Paris now
My children dance and dream
Hearing the ways of a miner's life
In words they've never seen I sail my memories of home
Like boats across the Seine
And watch the Paris sun
As it sets in my father's eyes again My father always promised us
That we would live in France
We'd go boating on the Seine
And I would learn to dance I sail my memories of home
Like boats across the Seine
And watch the Paris sun
As it sets in my father's eyes again Traditional He's got the whole world in His hands

So if you are serious, don't play with my heart, it makes me furious
But if you want me to love you, you know I will, you know I will
Tell it like it is. Don't be ashamed, let your conscience be your guide
I know deep down inside of me I believe you love me
So forget your foolish pride, life is too short for sorrow
You may be here today and gone tomorrow
You might aswell get what you want
So go on and please

Tell it like it is

So wild is the wind Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind Traditional Oh she was a lass from the low country
And he was a lord of high degree
But she loved him oh so tenderly
Oh sorrow sing sorrow
Now she sleeps in the valley where the wild flowers nod
No-one knows how she loved him but herself and god One day when the snow was on the mead
She passed him by on a milk white steed 
And she spoke to him low nobody paid no need
Oh sorrow sing sorrow
Now she sleeps in the valley where the wild flowers nod
No-one knows how she loved him but herself and god Now if you be a lass from the low country
Don't love no man of high degree
For he don't got a heart or no sympathy
Oh sorrow sing sorrow
Now she sleeps in the valley where wild flowers nod
No-one knows how she loved him but herself and god I live alone.
That hasn't always been easy to do.
But just a single woman;
Some times as night the walls talk back to me.
They seem to say
Wasn't yesterday, a better day. Always alone at home or in a crowd;
A single woman out on a private cloud;
Caught in a world few people understand.
I am what I am....only one single woman. There was a time...I can't remember when.
The house was full of love but then again
It might have been imaginations plan,
Just to help along,
One single Woman. instrumental One more Sunday in Savannah

And my old wedding ring
With these few goodbye words
How can I sing
Goodbye old sleepy head
I'm packing you in like I said Take care of everything
I'm leaving my wedding ring
Don't look for me
I'll get ahead
Remember darling
Don't smoke in bed Don't look for me
I'll get ahead
Remember darling
Don't smoke in bed True love seed in the autumn ground.
True love seed in the autumn ground.
Where will it be found? True love deep in the winter white snow.
True love deep in the winter white snow.
How long will it take to grow? You know true love buds in the April air.
You know true love buds in the April air.
Was there ever a bud so fair? True love blooms for the world to see.
True love blooms for the world to see.
Blooms high upon the July tree. Like a flower waiting to bloom
Like a light bulb in a dark room
I am here waitin' for you to come on home
And turn me on
Like the desert waitin' for rain
Like a school kid waitin' for spring
I am sittin' here waitin' for you to come on back home
And turn me on
My poor heart, it's been so dark
Since you've been gone
After all you're the one that turned me off
Now you're the only one that can turn me back on, uh
My hi-fi's waitin' for a new tune
And my glass is waitin' for some fresh ice cubes
I'm just sittin' here waitin' for you to come home
And turn me on Nina Simone
Stars
(Janis Ian) I was never one for singing what I really feel
Except tonight I'm bringing everything I know that's real Stars, they come and go, they come fast or slow
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze
And all you see is glory
Hey but it gets lonely there when there's no one here to share
We can shake it away, if you'll hear a story People lust for fame like athletes in a game,
we break our collarbones and come up swinging,
some of us are downed
some of us are crowned, and some are lost and never found
But most have seen it all,
they live their lives in sad cafes and music halls
They always come up singing Some make it when they're young,
before the world has done its dirty job
and later on someone will say
"You've had your day, now you must make way"
But they'll never know the pain of living with a name you never owned
or the many years forgetting what you know too well
That the ones who gave the crown have been let down
You try to make amends without defending
Perhaps pretending you never saw the eyes of grown men of twenty-five
that follow as you walk and ask for autographs
Or kiss you on the cheek and you never can believe they really loved you
Some make it when they're old
(Perhaps they have a soul they're not afraid to bare
or perhaps there's nothing there) Stars, they come and go, they come fast they come slow
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze
And all you see is glory
But most have seen it all,
they live their lives in sad cafes and music halls
They always have a story Some women have a body men will want to see
and so they put it on display
Some people play a fine guitar, I could listen to them play all day
Some ladies really move across the stage and gee, they sure can dance
I guess I could learn how, if I gave it half a chance But I always feel so funny when my body tries to soar
And I seem to always worry about missing the next chord
I guess there isn't anything to put up on display
Except the tunes, and whatever else I say
But anyway, that isn't really what I meant to say
I meant to tell a story, I live from day to day Stars, they come and go, they're coming fast they come slow
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze
And all you see is glory
But most have seen it all,
who live their lives in sad cafes and music halls
And we always have a story So if you don't lose patience with my fumbling around
I'll come up singing for you, even when I'm down She does not know her beauty
She thinks her brown glory
She thinks her brown body has no glory If she could dance naked under palm trees
And see her image in the river she would know
Yes, she would know But there are no palm trees in the street
No palm trees in the street
And dishwater gives back no images She does not know her beauty
She thinks her brown body has no glory If she could dance naked under palm trees
And see her image in the river she would know
Yes, she would know yes, she would know But there are no palm trees in the street
No palm trees in the street
And dishwater gives back no image Oscar Brown jr Eve and Adam had a garden everything was great
Till one day a boy says pardon Miss my name is snake
See that apple over yonder if you'll take a bite
You and Adam both are bound to have some fun tonight
Go on and eat forbidden fruit
It's mighty sweet forbidden fruit
It's quite a treat forbidden fruit
Go ahead and taste it you don't wanna waste it The Lord had said in the beginning everything is free
Except that apple that leads to sinning so let that apple be
But Eve got tempted so she tried it and as all chicks do
Teaser her man till he decided he'd just try some too
Go on and eat forbidden fruit
It's mighty sweet forbidden fruit
It's quite a treat forbidden fruit
Go ahead and bite it I bet you'd be delighted I hate to tell you all what followed the Lord was most upset
Saw them making love and hollered what have you to add
And when they made a full confession the Lord said hm I see
I guess I'll have to teach you a lesson about not minding me
Go on and eat forbidden fruit
It's mighty sweet forbidden fruit
It's quite a treat forbidden fruit
You're all indebted now you gonna get it The Lord made Eve Adam's madam have his kids and all
Placed some labour laws on Adam and he made the snake to fall
Ever since the days of Eden folks been sinful my
Nowadays they're even eating apples in their pie
Go on and eat forbidden fruit
It's mighty sweet forbidden fruit
It's quite a treat forbidden fruit
Go ahead and taste it you don't wanna waste it
Oh go ahead and bite it I bet you'd be delighted
You always did it now you'll gonna get it
Forbidden fruit You're nothing but a dirty, dirty old man
You do your thinking with a one track mind
Keep talkin' about heaven glory
But on your face is a different story
Clean up your rap your story's getting dusty
Wash out your mouth, your lies are getting rusty
Can't believe nothing you say
'Cause I'm around and I see what you do
You know, you're funkier than a mosquito's tweeter
You got a mouth like a herd of bollweevils
Same old game, same old thing you never changed
Always rappin' 'bout the same old thing
I got something to tell ya, I got something to tell you baby
But you ain't hip to baby, blowin' minds is a thing of the past
You blew your chance that's why you never last
You want to be a graduated mother, but in reality just another brother
You think you slick but could stand a lot of greasing
The things you do ain't never really pleasin'
Can't believe nothin' you say
'Cause I'm around and I see what you do
You know you funkier than a mosquito's tweeter
You got a mouth like a herd of bollweevils
Same old game, same old thing
Always rappin' 'bout the same old thing
[Incomprehensible]
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful
You put yourself upon a big stool
Nothin' worse than an educated fool
Talkin' sex is your favorite conversation
But peace and love is a famous generation
What's in your head has really started showing
Your conversation gettin' kinda boring
Can't believe nothin' you say
'Cause I'm around and I see what you do
You know you are funkier than a mosquito's tweeter
You got a mouth like a herd of bollweevils
Same old game, same old game
Same old thing you never change
Same old game, same old thing
Always rappin' 'bout the same old thing Do I move you, is it thrillin'?
Do I groove you, are you willin'?
Do I soothe you, tell the truth now
Do I move you, are you loose now? The answer better be yes, yes
That pleases me Are you ready for this action?
Does it give you satisfaction?
Are you hip to what I'm sayin'?
If you are, then let's start swayin' The answer better be yes, yes
That pleases me When I touch you do you quiver
From your head down to your liver?
If you like it let me know it
Don't be psychic or you'll blow it The answer better be yes, yes
Great God almighty, that pleases me You ain't never been blue, no, no, no
You ain't never been blue
Till you've had that mood indigo
That feeling goes stealing right down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh
Go along blues I always get that mood indigo
Since my baby said goodbye
And in the evening when the lights are low
I'm so lonely I could cry
For there's nobody who cares about me
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be
When I get that mood indigo
I could lay me down and die You ain't been blue, no, no, no
You ain't never been blue
Till you've had that mood indigo
That feeling goes stealing right down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh
Go along blues Bob Dylan When you're lost in the rain in Juarez
and it's Easter time too
and your gravity fails
and negativity don't pull you through
don't put on any airs
when you're down on rue morgue avenue
they got some hungry women there
and they really make a mess out of you Now if you see Saint Annie
please tell her thanks a lot
I cannot move
my fingers are all in a knot
I don't have the strength
to get up and take another shot
and my best friend my doctor
won't even say what it is I have got Sweet Melinda
the peasants call her the goddess of gloom
she speaks good English
and she invites you up into her room
and you're so kind
and careful not to go to her too soon
and she takes your voice
and leaves you howling at the moon Up on housing project hill
it's either fortune or fame
you must pick one or the other
though neither of them
are to be what they claim
if you're looking to get silly
you better go back from where you came
because the cops don't need you
and man they expect the same Now all the authorities
they just stand around and boast
hew they blackmailed the sergeant at arms
into leaving his post
and picking up angel who
just arrived here from the coast
who looked so fine at first
but left looking like a ghost I started out on burgundy
but soon hit the harder stuff
everybody said they'd stand behind me
when the game got rough
but the joke was on me
there was nobody even there to bluff
I'm going back to New York City
I do believe I've had enough What? gonna happen now? In all of our cities?
My people are rising; they? e living in lies.
Even if they have to die
Even if they have to die at the moment they know what life is
Even at that one moment that ya know what life is
If you have to die, it? all right
Cause you know what life is
You know what freedom is for one moment of your life

But he had seen the mountaintop
And he knew he could not stop
Always living with the threat of death ahead
Folks you? better stop and think
Everybody knows we? e on the brink
What will happen, now that the King is dead?

We can all shed tears; it won? change a thing
Teach your people: Will they ever learn?
Must you always kill with burn and burn with guns
And kill with guns and burn - don? you know how we gotta react?

But he had seen the mountaintop
And he knew he could not stop
Always living with the threat of death ahead
Folks you? better stop and think
Everybody knows we? e on the brink
What will happen, now that the King of love is dead? Love me, love me, love me, say you do
Let me fly away with you
For my love is like the wind
And wild is the wind Give me more than one caress
Satisfy this hungriness
Let the wind blow through your heart
For wild is the wind You touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me
With your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me
All things to me Don't you know you're life itself
Like a leaf clings to a tree
Oh my darling, cling to me
For we're creatures of the wind
And wild is the wind
So wild is the wind You touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me
With your kiss my life begins
Dady, you're spring to me
All things to me Don't you know you're life itself
Like a leaf clings to a tree
Oh my darling, cling to me
For we're creatures of the wind
And wild is the wind
So wild is the wind Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind

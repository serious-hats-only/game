I don't want to get over you
I guess I could take a sleeping pill and sleep at will
And not have to go through what I go through
I guess I should take Prozac, right and just smile all night
At somebody new, somebody not too bright but sweet and kind
Who would try to get you off my mind, I could leave this agony behind
Which is just what I'd do if I wanted to but I don't want to get over you
'Cause I don't want to get over love
I could listen to my therapist, pretend you don't exist
And not have to dream of what I dream of
I could listen to all my friends and go out again
And pretend it's enough or I could make a career of being blue
I could dress in black and read Camus
Smoke clove, cigarettes and drink Vermouth
Like I was 17, that would be a scream but I don't want to get over you The book of love is long and boring
No one can lift the damn thing
It's full of charts and facts and figures
and instructions for dancing
but I, I love it when you read to me
and you, you can read me anything The book of love has music in it
In fact that's where music comes from
Some of it is just transcendental
Some of it is just really dumb
but I, I love it when you sing to me
and you, you can sing me anything The book of love is long and boring
and written very long ago
It's full of flowers and heart-shaped boxes
and things we're all too young to know
but I, I love it when you give me things
and you, you ought to give me wedding rings
I, I love it when you give me things
and you, you ought to give me wedding rings Neol ana juji moshaeseo

I also have a Dobro, made in some mountain range
Sounds like a mountain range in love
But when I turn up the tone on my electric guitar I'm afraid of the dark
Without you close to me
I'm afraid of the dark
Without you close to me I went out to the forest and caught
A 100, 000 fireflies
As they ricochet 'round my room
They remind me of your starry eyes
Someone else's might not have made me so sad
But this is the worst night I ever had 'Cause I'm afraid of the dark
Without you close to me
I'm afraid of the dark
Without you close to me
Always close You won't be happy with me
But give me one more chance
You won't be happy anyway
Why do we still live here
In this repulsive town?
All our friends are in New York Why do we keep shrieking
When we mean soft things?
We should be whispering all the time I don't want to get over you

Why do we still live here
In this repulsive town?
All our friends are in New York Why do we keep shrieking
When we mean soft things?
We should be whispering all the time See them on their big bright screen
Tan and blonde and seventeen
Eating nonfood keeps them mean
But they're young forever If they must grow up
They marry dukes and earls
I hate California girls They ain't broke, so they put on airs
The faux folk sans derrieres
They breathe coke and they have affairs
With each passing rock star They come on like squares
Then get off like squirrels
I hate California girls Looking down their perfect noses at me and my kind
Do they think we won't? Well, never mind
Laughing through their perfect teeth at everyone I know
Do they think we won't get up and go? So... I have planned my grand attacks
I will stand behind their backs
With my brand-new battle ax
Then will they taste my wrath They will hear me say
As the pavement whirls
"I hate California girls" They will hear me say
As the pavement whirls
"I hate California girls" They will hear me say
As the pavement whirls
"I hate California girls" They will hear me say
As the pavement whirls
"I hate California girls" They will hear me say
As the pavement whirls
"I hate California girls" They will hear me say
As the pavement whirls... I like your twisted point of view, Mike
I like your questioning eyebrows
You've made it pretty clear what you like
It's only fair to tell you now that I leave early in the morning
and I won't be back till next year
I see that kiss-me pucker forming
but maybe you should plug it with a beer, cause Papa was a rodeo - Mama was a rock'n'roll band
I could play guitar and rope a steer before I learned to stand
Home was anywhere with diesel gas - Love was a trucker's hand
Never stuck around long enough for a one night stand
Before you kiss me you should know
Papa was a rodeo The light reflecting off the mirror ball
looks like a thousand swirling eyes
They make me think I shouldn't be here at all
You know, every minute someone dies What are we doing in this dive bar
How can you live in a place like this
Why don't you just get into my car
and I'll take you away I'll take that kiss now, but (boy) Papa was a rodeo... And now it's 55 years later
We've had the romance of the century
After all these years wrestling gators
I still feel like crying when I think of what you said to me Papa was a rodeo... Before you kiss me you should know - Papa was a rodeo
What a coincidence, your Papa was a rodeo too A pity she does not exist
A shame he's not a fag
The only girl I ever loved was
Andrew in drag There is no hope of love for me
From here on I'll go stag
The only girl I'll ever love is
Andrew in drag Andrew in drag
Andrew in drag
Andrew in drag
Yeah I don't know why I even went
It's really not my bag
Just thought it might be funny to see
Andrew in drag The moment he walked on the stage
My tail began to wag
Wag like a little wiener dog for
Andrew in drag
Andrew in drag, Andrew in drag
Andrew in drag
Yeah I've always been a ladies' man
And I don't have to brag
But I'd become a momma's boy for
Andrew in drag I'd sign away my trust fund
I would even sell the Jag
If I could spend my misspent youth with
Andrew in drag Andrew in drag
Andrew in drag
Andrew in drag
Yeah So stick him in a dress and
He's the only boy I'd shag
The only boy I'd anything is
Andrew in drag I'll never see that girl again
He did it as a gag
I'll pine away forevermore for
Andrew in drag You are a splendid butterfly
It is your wings that make you beautiful
And I could make you fly away
But I could never make you stay You said you were in love with me
Both of us know that that's impossible
And I could make you rue the day
But I could never make you stay Not for all the tea in China
Not if I could sing like a bird
Not for all North Carolina
Not for all my little words
Not if I could write for you
The sweetest song you ever heard
It doesn't matter what I'll do
Not for all my little words Now that you've made me want to die
You tell me that you're unboyfriendable
And I could make you pay and pay
But I could never make you stay Not for all the tea in China
Not if I could sing like a bird
Not for all North Carolina
Not for all my little words
Not if I could write for you
The sweetest song you ever heard
It doesn't matter what I'll do
Not for all my little words
It doesn't matter what I'll do

Corrected version: Strange Powers On the ferris wheel
Looking out on Coney island 
Under more stars than
There are prostitutes in Thailand 
Our hair in the air
Our lips blue from cotton candy 
When we kiss it feels
Like a flying saucer landing  And i can't sleep
Cause you got strange powers
You're in my dreams
Strange powers In Las Vegas where
The electric bills are staggering
The decor hog wild
And the entertainment saccharine
What a golden age 
What a time of right and reason
The consumers king
And unhappiness is treason And i can't sleep
Cause you got strange powers
You're in my dreams
Strange powers The sun pours down like money
The moon runs down like mercury
The stars fall down like money
And you come down to me And i can't sleep
Cause you got strange powers
You're in my dreams
Strange powers And i can't sleep
Cause you got strange powers
You're in my dreams
Strange powers Dance with me my old friend, once before we go
Let's pretend this song won't end
And we never have to go home
And we'll dance among the chandeliers
And nothing matters when we're dancing
In tat or tatters you're entrancing
Be we in Paris or in Lansing
Nothing matters when we're dancing
You've never been more beautiful
Your eyes like two full moons
As here in this poor old dance hall
Among the dreadful tunes
The awful songs we don't even hear
And nothing matters when we're dancing
In tat or tatters you're entrancing
Be we in Paris or in Lansing
Nothing matters when we're dancing
And nothing matters when we're dancing
In tat or tatters you're entrancing
Be we in Paris or in Lansing
Nothing matters when we're dancing
Nothing matters when we're dancing Are you out of love with me?
Are you longing to be free?
Do I drive you up a tree?
Yeah! Oh, yeah!
Do I drive you up the wall?
Do you dread every phone call?
Can you not stand me at all?
Yeah! Oh, yeah!
Though I need you more than air
is it true you just don't care?
Are you having an affair?
Yeah! Oh, yeah!
When we met I thought
money was everything
so I let you buy the house,
the car, the ring
but I can't take your perpetual whining
and you can't sing
I though if we live apart
we could made a brand-new start
Do you want to break my heart?
Yeah! Oh, yeah!
I've enjoyed making you
miserable for years
found peace of mind in
playing on your fears
How I loved to catch your gold
and silver tears, but now my dear
What a dark and dreary life
Are you reaching for a knife?
Could you really kill your wife?
Yeah! Oh, yeah!
Of, I die, I die, I die!
So it's over, you and I
Was my whole life just a lie?
Yeah! Oh, yeah! Crows in the trees spanish hotels by the sea
We wave goodbye airplanes draw swords in the sky I'm so rich and you're so bored
Are you the trouble I've been looking for
You go out and you slam the door
Are you the trouble I've been looking for. My eyes still burn whether you leave or return
The flowers bloom when you walk into the room I'm so rich and you're so bored
Are you the trouble I've been looking for
You go out and you slam the door
Are you the trouble I've been looking for. You stole it all and wrote my name on a wall
I've moved again I've changed my name again I'm so rich and you're so bored
Are you the trouble I've been looking for
You go out and you slam the door
Are you the trouble I've been looking for They say there's a sun in the sky
But me, I can't imagine why
There might have been one
Before you were gone
But now all I see is the night
So I don't believe in the sun
How could it shine down on everyone?
Never shine on me
How could there be such cruelty?
The only sun I ever knew
Was the beautiful one that was you
Since you went away
It's nighttime all day
And it's usually raining too
So I don't believe in the sun
How could it shine down on everyone?
And never shine on me
How could there be such cruelty?
The only stars there really are
Were shining in your eyes
There is no sun except the one
That never shone on other guys
The moon to whom the poets croon
Has given up and died
Astronomy will have to be revised
I don't believe in the sun
How could it shine down on everyone?
And never shine on me
How could there be such cruelty? Before you left your garrison
You'd had a drink, maybe two
You don't remember Paris, hon
But it remembers you
It's true, we flew to Paris, dear
Aboard an Army jet
The night you can't remember
The night I can't forget
You said I was terrific
It meant zilch to you, ah
But I have our marriage certificate
And I'll keep it till I die
You were an Army officer
And I just a Rochette
The night you can't remember
The night I can't forget
No rose conveyed your sentiments
Not even a petunia
But you've got vague presentiments
And I've got little Junior
You said, nobody loves me
And I said, wanna bet?
The night you can't remember
The night I can't forget All the summer days
Where we used to play
Walking hand in hand
Castles in the sand So you said goodnight
But you meant goodbye
Now our love has died
This is why I cry, cry From the madding crowd
Pointing up at clouds
Summer turned to fall
Pictures on the wall So you said goodnight
But you meant goodbye
Now our love has died
This is why I cry, cry, cry, cry So you said goodnight
But you meant goodbye
Now our love has died
This is why I cry, cry, cry, cry I do believe, our love's in danger
I might as well, be loving air
You look at me, like I'm a stranger
You look at me, like I'm not there I gaze into, your eyes of blue
But their beauty, is not for me
You're thinkin' of, someone who's gone
You're dreamin' of, the one you really love
You're dreamin' of, the one you really love I made you mine, or so it seemed
Though he is dead, he haunts your dreams
I might as well, be two feet tall
You never will, love me at all I gaze into, your eyes of blue
(Oo, oo)
(Oo, oo)
But their beauty, is not for me
(Ee, ee)
You're thinkin' of, someone who's gone
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
You're dreamin' of, the one you really love
You're dreamin' of, the one you really love I gaze into, your eyes of blue
(Oo, oo)
(Oo, oo)
But their beauty, is not for me
(Ee, ee)
You're thinkin' of, someone who's gone
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
You're dreamin' of, the one you really love
You're dreamin' of, the corpse you really love I'm going back to the country
City life's too slow
I'm sick of that 120 BPM funk and disco
I'm doing a one-eighty
Break out the fiddle tunes
I'm still that barefoot lady howling up at full moons And I'm gonna fly back to Wyoming
And never more my friends I'll go a-roaming
I'm gonna fly back to Laramie
Let Laramie take care of me till they bury me I'm going back to the country
The big city's too small
I don't need more than one tree house but there's none at all
I'm hanging up the tire swing
A hammock in the yard
I'll hear an angel choir sing as I wing countryward And I'm gonna find me a country boy
And have a couple country kids, Leanne and Leroy
And we're gonna wind down those country roads
And sing and play the dulcimer till this world explodes how fucking romantic
all the stars are out
twinkling twinkling twinkling
and fluttering about what a tacky sunset
what a vulgar moon
play another charming
rogers and hart tune how fucking romantic
must we really waltz?
drag another cliche
howling from the vaults love you obviously
like you really care
even though you treat me
like a dancing bear toss your bear a goldfish
as he cycles by
don't forget to feed your
bear or it'll die Softly the crystals falling on 17th Street
Do their dance and die and are gone
Millions of crystal balls roll around your feet
Nothing gets done
An hour goes by, she doesn't
If you don't cry, it isn't love
If you don't cry
Then you just don't feel it deep enough
Dying all day in thousands of little ways
Dancing alone and drinking a lot
Closing the clubs and haunting the cabarets
Looking for what
Another five years of your life
If you don't cry, it isn't love
If you don't cry
Then you just don't feel it deep enough
A year goes by, she doesn't
If you don't cry, it isn't love
If you don't cry
Then you just don't feel it deep enough
If you don't cry, it isn't love
If you don't cry
Then you just don't feel it deep enough Well, I don't care what people say
Life is too short to hang around
So I stay so long in a place
And then move on to the next town Oh, Sunset City
I've got to see the world
Don't hold me too tightly
Don't whisper my name Sad-eyed, baby
I'm not that kind of girl
When the dice stop rolling
There's no more to the game When the time comes to say goodbye And in the morning I'll be gone
For other towns and other lives
I'll catch the first train, bag in hand
And I won't miss you, and you won't cry Oh, Sunset City
I've got to see the world
Don't hold me too tightly
Don't whisper my name Sad-eyed, baby
I'm not that kind of girl
When the dice stop rolling
There's no more to the game When the time comes to say goodbye Oh, Sunset City
I've got to see the world
Don't hold me too tightly
Don't whisper my name Sad-eyed, baby
I'm not that kind of girl
When the dice stop rolling
There's no more to the game Andy would bicycle across town
In the rain to bring you candy
And John would buy the gown
For you to wear to the prom
With Tom the astronomer, who'd name a star for you But I'm the luckiest guy
On the Lower East Side
'Cause I've got wheels
And you want to go for a ride Harry is the one I think you'll marry
But it's Chris that you kissed after school
Well, I'm a fool, there's no doubt
But when the sun comes out
And only when the sun comes out I'm the luckiest guy
On the Lower East Side
'Cause I've got wheels
And you want to go for a ride The day is beautiful and so are you
My car is ugly but then I'm ugly too
I know you'd never give me a second glance
But when the weather's nice all the other guys don't stand a chance I know Professor Blumen makes you feel like a woman
But when the wind is in your hair you laugh like a little girl
So you share secrets with Lou, but we've got secrets too
Well, one: I only keep this heap for you 'Cause I'm the ugliest guy
On the Lower East Side
But I've got wheels
And you want to go for a ride
Want to go for a ride?
Want to go for a ride?
Want to go for a ride? You better think of something quick before I don't love you no more
Quick! Before I walk out that door
Quick! Before it all ends in jeers
What a waste of all those beers You better think of something quick because my suitcase is packed
Quick! Because I'm through being attacked
Are you really prepared to lose
All this just to air your views? We're on the brink of something
Get me a drink of something Quick! Between your outrageous remarks
Like the mating calls of sarcastic sharks
Quick! Before you can't take that back
Just before it all goes black You better think of something quick before the midnight bell chimes
You're living in dangerous times
Torture me for your amusement
About who will pay the rent Who will pay the rent
Who will pay the rent
Who will pay the rent
Who will pay the rent
Who will pay the rent It makes you blind, it does you in
It makes you think you're pretty tough
It makes you prone to crime and sin
It makes you say thing off the cuff
It's very small and made of glass
and grossly over-advertised
It turns a genius into an ass
and makes a fool think he is wise
It could make you regret your birth
or turn cartwheels in your best suit
It costs a lot more than it's worth
and yet there is no substitute
They keep it on a higher shelf
the older and more pure it grows
It has no color in itself
but it can make you see rainbows
You can find it at the Bowery
or you can find it at Elaine's
It makes your words more flowery
It makes the sun shine, makes it rain
You just get what they put in
and they never put in enough
Love is like a bottle of gin
but a bottle of gin is not like love Why would I stop loving you
A hundred years from now?
It's only time
It's only time
What could stop this beating heart
Once it's made a vow?
It's only time
It's only time
If rain won't change your mind
Let it fall
The rain won't change my heart
At all
Lock this chain around my hand
Throw away the key
It's only time
It's only time
Years falling like grains of sand
Mean nothing to me
It's only time
It's only time
Let it fall
The snow won't change my heart
Not at all
(I'll walk your lands)
I'll walk your lands
(And swim your sea)
And swim your sea
Marry me
Marry me
(Then in your hands)
Then in your hands
(I will be free)
I will be free
Marry me
Marry me
Why would I stop loving you
A hundred years from now? I want to be a playboy's bunny
I'd do whatever they asked me to.
I'd meet people with lots of money,
and men would love me like I loved you. I want to be a topless waitress,
I want my mother to shed one tear.
I'd throw away this old sad day dress
slip into something a tad more shear. I want to be an artist's model
I'd like to so au naturel
I should be good, at spin the bottle
While I've still got something left to sell I want to be a cobra dancer
With little worry between my thighs
I may not find a cure for cancer
But I'll meet plenty of single guys. I'd like to be a brothel worker,
I've always been treated like one.
If I could be a backstreet lover,
I'd make more money and have more fun. I want to be a dominatrix
which isn't likely, but I can dream.
Learn S&M; and all those play tricks
and men will pay me to make them scream I want to be a porno starlet
I'll have to wait till mom is dead
I'd see my name in lights of scarlet
And get to spend everyday in bed I want to be a tattooed lady,
Dedicated as I am to art.
Characters warm, complex, and shaded
I'll write my memoirs across my heart So you quote love unquote me
Well stranger things have come to be
But let's agree to disagree
Cause I don't believe you. I don't believe in you.
You tell me I'm not not cute
It's truth or false [something]
But honesty's not your strong suit
And I don't believe you. I don't believe in you.
You tell me of what once was and about [something] 
How they were not like me because
But I don't believe you. I don't believe in you. I had a dream and you were in it. / the blue of your eyes was infinite.
You seemed to be / in love with me / which isn't very realistic. You [something] and I'll stop crying halfway through 
But nothing else you say is true
So I don't believe you. I don't believe in you. 
[something] and say I'm [something] I'm full of fun
But you say that to everyone
Well I don't believe you. I don't believe in you. 
So you're brilliant [something] 
You think I just don't understand
But I don't believe you. I don't believe you. / I don't believe you. I don't believe you. When I was young I saw a square 
A hole where something should be there.
I knew all this was just a cage
This knowledge has not changed with age
I knew then and I know it still
I'm being held against my will
Inside this stupid hologram 
So I won't find out who I am. 
I really just pretend to care.
When I'm not looking, you're not there.
And you and your disgusting lies 
Like gravity and compromise / and flesh and life and love and time,
That's your opinion it's not mine.
I live among the robots now
But I'll find my way out somehow
So save your big reality
For when you're so called touching me.
You're only colors in thin air.
When I'm not looking you're not there. If I was the Grand Canyon
I'd echo everything you say
but I'm just me I'm only me
and you used to love me that way
so you know how to love me that way If I was Paul Bunyan
I'd carry you so far away
but I'm just me I'm only me
and you used to love me that way
so you know how to love me that way. All the things I knew I didn't know
And didn't want to know
That you told me
Just to tell me later that you'd told me so
Come flooding back to me now
Come on come flooding back to me now
All the things you said you'd never say and you said anyway
The things we did and didn't do
The things we did and didn't do
Come flooding back to me now (The only requirement, when playing this song, is that you wear sunglasses) Love is like jazz
You make it up as you go along
and you act as
if you really knew the song
but you don't
and you never will
so you flaunt your mistakes
and you make them until
they were you
Love is like jazz
the same song a million times
in different ways
"Strange Fruit" with
and without wind chimes
It's divine
It's asinine
It's depressing
and it's almost entirely
window dressing
but it'll do You told me you loved me
I know where and when
Come sunrise, surprise surprise
The joke's on me again I know you don't love me
You know I don't care
Keep it hidden better
Did I say the world was fair? I thought I was just the guy
For you and it would never end
I thought we were supposed to be
Like glue I thought you were my boyfriend
I thought you were my boyfriend Love or not I've always got
Ten guys on whom I can depend
And if you're not mine
One less is nine; get wise I thought you were my boyfriend
I thought you were my boyfriend I just hope you're happy
Stringing me along
While you're stringing
I'm here singing
This, my saddest song I wish I could see you
I wish I could sleep
Should I freak out? Should I seek out
Someone I could keep? I thought I was just the guy
For you and it would never end
I thought we were supposed to be
Like glue I thought you were my boyfriend
I thought you were my boyfriend Love or not I've always got
Ten guys on whom I can depend
And if you're not mine
One less is nine; get wise I thought you were my boyfriend
I thought you were my boyfriend I wanted you tonight
I walked around alot
Wishing you were here
To keep me from sleeping With anyone who might
Want me, or even not
Some guys have a beer
And they'll do anything
Anything
Anything... I thought I was just the guy
For you and it would never end (Thought you were my boyfriend...)
I thought we were supposed to be
Like glue I thought you were my boyfriend (Thought you were my boyfriend...)
I thought you were my boyfriend Love or not I've always got
Ten guys on whom I can depend (Thought you were my boyfriend...)
And if you're not mine
One less is nine; get wise I thought you were my boyfriend (Thought you were my boyfriend...)
I thought you were my boyfriend... I thought I was just the guy
For you and it would never end (Thought you were my boyfriend...)
I thought we were supposed to be
Like glue If I were Napoleon, you could be my Josephine
We could go to drive-in films in my red convertible
If I were Napoleon, I might be in magazines
I'd write some science fiction - science fiction about you
You could be my Josephine: just you and your chaperone
Let you be my Josephine, Josephine
If I were Napoleon, you could be my lady love
Look into my soft blue eyes
Run your fingers through my hair
If I were Napoleon, you could be my turtle-dove
Living out in Corsica in our summer cottages
And you could be my Josephine and we could be Siamese twins
Let you be my Josephine, Josephine We used to go out on the summer nights
And dance in the neon rain
We used to hold hands at the movie show
But we'll never hold hands again Do, do, do, do come on
Do, do, do, do come on Those days are gone
You and I were young those summer nights
You'll see the world diving for a girl
You'll never find and then we'll quietly grow old
The saddest story ever told Once upon a time we fell in love
Or at least that's what you said
You say I can find someone else
But I just wish I was dead Do, do, do, do come on
Do, do, do, do come on Those days are gone
You and I were young those summer nights
You'll see the world diving for a girl
You'll never find and then we'll quietly grow old
The saddest story ever told Don't fall in love with me yet
We only recently met
True, I'm in love with you, but
You might decide I'm a nut
Give me a week or two to
Go absolutely cuckoo
Then when you see your error
Then you can flee in terror
Like everybody else does
I only tell you this 'cause
I'm easy to get rid of
But not if you fall in love
Know now that I'm on the make
And if you make a mistake
My heart will certainly break
I'll have to jump in a lake
And all my friends will blame you
There's no telling what they'll do
It's only fair to tell you
I'm absolutely cuckoo Don't fall in love with me yet
We only recently met
True, I'm in love with you, but
You might decide I'm a nut
Give me a week or two to
Go absolutely cuckoo
Then when you see your error
Then you can flee in terror
Like everybody else does
I only tell you this 'cause
I'm easy to get rid of
But not if you fall in love
Know now that I'm on the make
And if you make a mistake
My heart will certainly break
I'll have to jump in a lake
And all my friends will blame you
There's no telling what they'll do
It's only fair to tell you
I'm absolutely cuckoo It's only fair to tell you
I'm absolutely cuckoo When I was a little boy
Way out in the the wood
I had neither friend nor toy
Never knew I could When I found this lonely road
Off I walked for good
When I was a little boy
Way out in the wood Walk a lonely road with me
I will walk with you
Half as lonely we will be
When we walk as two If the road goes straight uphill
We'll admire the view
Walk a lonely road with me
I will walk with you When I was a little girl
On the lonesome plain
I had neither pal nor pearl
Mostly wind and rain One day I set out along
A little winding lane
When I was a little girl
On the lonesome plain Walk a lonely road with me
I will walk with you
Half as lonely we will be
When we walk as two If the road goes straight uphill
We'll admire the view
Walk a lonely road with me
I will walk with you I'm counting the habits you made me break
I'm counting the drugs you won't let me take
I'm counting my friends you won't let me see I've had enough, you never give me anything
Don't you know love goes home to Paris in the spring? Adding up the odds, I've waited for you
I'm counting the calls that never came through
I'm counting my friends you melted away
I'm counting the times you came for a day I've had enough, you never give me anything
Don't you know love goes home to Paris in the spring? With an ivory pipe
And a cummerbund
In the dead of night
On the autobahn
With the long ago
On the radio
And the dreaming moon...
We were young and in love
In a burning town
But the fire went out
I'm alone again now
And I finally know
How cool to be cold
With the dreaming moon
I'll begin again
With another new name
And a whole new life
Full of fortune and fame
But in the 100th year
I'll be right back here
With the dreaming moon Time provides the rope but love will tie the slipknot
And I will be the chair you kick away
You don't even like anything you like or the people you know
And all of your reasons to stay alive died I dedicate this song to you
For all the desperate things you made me do
I'd like to beat you black and blue
For all the agony you have put me through Front seat stained with love, a back seat full of bibles
Purloined from the drawers of lost motels
They say when you're older you'll understand, you know it's a lie
'Cause you've got a twisted and mangled heart I dedicate this song to you
For all the desperate things you made me do
I'd like to beat you black and blue
For all the agony you have put me through Down route 66, you pilfered love and green stamps
W.C. Fields with Mae West in your eyes
They say every clock's a blunt instrument, crushing the skull
But you've got a vise to rest your head in I dedicate this song to you
For all the desperate things you made me do
I'd like to beat you black and blue
For all the agony you have put me through I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say
I don't know I could say I want you
That would be a bore
Maybe in a font you
Haven't seen before I could say I'll haunt you
Till your dying day
I could tease and taunt you
But what would I say? See, I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say
I don't know I could say I crave you
Still, you little brat
I could rant and rave, you
Know I can do that I could say I gave you
Everything I have
I could say I'll save you
You might think me mad So I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say I could try and lead you
Down the garden path
I could say I'll feed you
You can do the math I could say I need you
Offer you a ring
I'll be guaranteed you
Don't believe a thing So I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say
I don't know I could try to shove you
Off the nearest cliff
I could say I lo... He is my lord, He is my saviour and
He rewards my good behavior
My secret soul, I know He's seen it He says, come here baby and
kiss me like you mean it
He calls me baby,
says kiss me like you mean it He is my life and my salvation
He's always right,
He's always patient
I pinch myself
It's like I'm dreaming it... He says, come here baby and
kiss me like you mean it
He calls me baby,
says kiss me like you mean it He is my love, He's always been it... Sober, life is a prison
Shitfaced, it is a blessing
Sober, nobody wants you
Shitfaced, they're all undressing Oh, sober, it's ever darker
Shitfaced, the moon is nearer
Sober, you're old and ugly
Shitfaced, who needs a mirror? Oh sober, you're a Cro-Magnon
Shitfaced, you're very clever
Sober, you never should be
Shitfaced, now and forever I gotta get too drunk to dream
'Cause dreaming only makes me blue
I gotta get too drunk to dream
Because I only dream of you I gotta get too pissed to miss you
Or I'll never get to sleep
I gotta drink wine not to pine for you
And God knows that ain't cheap I know you think I'm insane
I know it's not appealing
But till I'm feeling no pain
Guess what I'll be feeling I gotta get too drunk to dream
'Cause dreaming only makes me blue
I gotta get too drunk to dream
Because I only dream of you I gotta get too fried to cry
Or I'll be crying all night long
I gotta get too high to sigh
Oh my God, where did I go wrong? So why do I get plastered?
And why am I so lonely?
It's you, you heartless bastard
You're my one and only I gotta get too drunk to dream
'Cause dreaming only makes me blue
I gotta get too drunk to dream
Because I only dream of you I gotta get too pissed to miss you
Or I'll never get to sleep
I gotta drink wine not to pine for you
And God knows that ain't cheap
And God knows that ain't cheap True, I'd give my right arm
To keep you safe from harm
(To keep you safe from harm)
And true, for you, I'd move to Ecuador
And I'd keep a little farm
Chop wood to keep you warm
(Chop wood to keep you warm)
But I don't really love you anymore
I don't have to love you now if I don't wish to
I won't see you anyhow if that's an issue
Because I am a gentleman
Think of me as just your fan
(Think of me as just your fan)
Who remembers every dress you ever wore
Just the bad comedian
Your new boyfriend's better than
'Cos I don't really love you anymore
There'll be someday
When your eyes do not enthrall me
I'll be numb
But realize you'll never call me
'Cos I've read your horoscope
And now I've given up all hope
(Now I've given up all hope)
So I don't really love you anymore
'Cos I've read your horoscope
And now I've given up all hope
(Now I've given up all hope)
So I don't really love you anymore i know all the names of your tears
and numbers of these lonely years
i know all the someones somedays
don't believe them anyway when you love someone
you can't always tell the sun
it will be twilight soon
save a secret moon
in a darkened room
write it on a black balloon
then watch it fade from view
save a secret for the moon i can show you sadder poetry
than you ever dreamed there could be
i know all the saddest people
most of them are dead now when you love someone
you can't always tell the sun
it will be twilight soon
save a secret moon
in a darkened room
write it on a black balloon
then watch it fade from view
save a secret for the moon Old fools, dancing
Old fools who believe
That they can dance and sing
And fall in love
After all, love Old wines, old shoes
Old lines who would've thought
They would ever reuse
Like I, love you
Surprise I, love you Flowers, long drive
Old fools, new lives Old fools, dancing
Old rules take the
Backseat to new romancing
Long drives, flowers
Old fools, new lives I spend my evenings alone
Talking to your picture, Babe Love is wrapped around my heart
Like a Boa constrictor, Babe My mother should have murdered me
What jury would convict her, Babe? For love is wrapped around my heart
Like a Boa constrictor, Babe Come back from San Francisco
It can't be all that pretty
When all of New York City misses you
Should pretty boys in discos
Distract you from your novel
Remember I'm awful in love with you You need me
Like the wind needs the trees
To blow in
Like the moon needs poetry
You need me Come back from San Francisco
And kiss me, I've quit smoking
I miss doing the wild thing with you
Will you stay, I don't think so
But all I do is worry
Pack bags, call cabs, and hurry home to me You need me
Like the wind needs the trees
To blow in
Like the moon needs poetry
You need me You need me
Like the wind needs the trees
To blow in
Like the moon needs poetry
You need me When you betray me, betray me with a kiss
Damn you, I've never stayed up as late as this My girl is the queen of the savages
She don't know this modern world
and its ravages
Instead of money she's
got yams and cabbages
She lives in a dome
I don't care if I never get home
My girl is the queen of the jungle folk
You should see the things
we see when we smoke
We think all of life is a funny joke
She's sharp as a tack
I don't care if I never get back
My girl is the queen of ten villages
We live on the fruits
of her pillages
She eats other queens,
she's very religious
She doesn't use a fork
I don't think I'll go back to New York Someone else's world goes by
As my train runs through this night
Someone else's rain comes down
But no rain can touch me now Smoke and mirrors
Special effects
A little fear, a little sex
That's all love is behind the tears Smoke and mirrors
We were foolish, you and I
But there's no reason to cry
We put on a lovely show
But that's all, I had to go Smoke and mirrors
Special effects
A little fear, a little sex
That's all love is behind the tears Smoke and mirrors
We were foolish, you and I
But there's no reason to cry
We put on a lovely show
But that's all, I had to go I don't know the stations names
I'll spend my life on this train Fumée et miroirs
Effets speciaux
Un peu de peur
Un peu de sexe
Sous les lârmes
L'amour n'est que sa
De la fumée et des miroirs If you don't mind, why don't you mind?
Where is your sense of indignation.
You are too kind, much too kind.
Where is the madness that you promised me?
Where is the dream for which I paid dearly? When things go wrong I sing along.
It is the nature of the business.
But you're not here to make my sad songs more sincere. No one will ever love you honestly.
No one will ever love you for your honesty.
No one will ever love you honestly.
No one will ever love you for your honesty. To my dear, dear mother
I leave my only shoes
To my dear, dear mother
I leave my only shoes By the time you read this
I will have died of the blues Scream little choo-choo
Bang your xylophone track
Scream little choo-choo
Bang your xylophone track You can wail all night long
But you can't bring her back I've done so much crying
The flesh has left my bones
I've done so much crying
The flesh has left my bones I can play my ribcage
Like a xylophone I think I'll make another world
And fill it with whatever I want
No one can say I can or can't
I can see it now I think I'll make another world
It may not start out very large
But no one else will be in charge
I can see it now
I can see it now And we will dance, you and I
Like we were very small
Through the air through the night
and through the marble hall
No one can say that's all wrong
'Cause I'll say get out of my song Cause I can see another world
And I can make it with my hands
Who cares if no one understands
I can see it now
I can see it now The little stuff I've dreamed about
Since I was just a zygote
The headless caryatid
With her plucky seeing eye goat
No one can say that's all wrong
'Cause I can say "Hey, it's my song" And I can see another world
And I can make it with my hands
Who cares if no one understands?
I can see it now
I can see it growing
And moving by itself
And talking in its own way
It's realer than the old one Should time allow us to describe our prowess
It would be quite hard to overrate
For we are the king of the boudoir old thing
And the king doesn't like to wait One tryst with me and you'll be spinning like a gyroscope
One tryst with me and you'll be pope Should modesty allow us to describe our prowesslessness, lessness
'Twould be hard to overstate
For we are the king of the boudoir it's true
And the king doesn't like to wait One kiss from me and you'll be overjoyed and overawed
One kiss from me and you'll see God For we are the king of the boudoir we are
And the king doesn't like to wait Abigail, can you feel my heart in the palm of your hand?
And do you understand why I can't stay?
Abigail, an evil wind is blowing through the land
And they need every man to drive it away When I come home, if I come home
You'll be a grown woman
When I come home, if I come home
Don't be alone, Abigail, Belle of Kilronan Abigail is gonna be the beauty of County Galway
And she will live always in a world of love
Abigail, I'm off to the war but you can be sure
I will know you're what I'm fighting for I'm off to the war but you can be sure
I will know you're what I'm fighting for
I'm off to the war but you can be sure
I will know you're what I'm fighting for When I come home, if I come home
You'll be a grown woman
When I come home, if I come home
Don't be alone, Abigail, Belle of Kilronan Though majoring in Visual and Environmental Studies
And minoring in History of Sci
I had to retake Ethics from my Mennonite professor
For whom my skepticism didn't fly The first time I made mincemeat of the standard propositions
Establishing a so-called moral science
And I declared morality an offshoot of aesthetics
And got a failing C for my defiance So next semester I back to Divinity School trotted
Proverbial tail not between my legs
And spent the whole course positing my own ethical system
While other college students emptied kegs Information ethics, cyberethics — both since taken —
Said: Maximize the information flow
Toward a hypothetical end state in which the cosmos
Consists entirely of our info
And at the highest level possible, not only data
But data about data dot dot dot
Or life on top of life on top of life, et cetera
Profundity, my mother'd say — I'd not My Mennonite professor did concede I'd done the coursework
Although my system left him quite dismayed
Depending, as it did, on neither history nor Jahweh
And gave me, finally, a passing grade Eligible, not too stupid
Intelligable and cute as Cupid
Knowledgable but not always right
Salvageable and free for the night Well, my heart's running 'round like a chicken with its head cut off
All around the barnyard, falling in and out of love
Poor thing's blind as a bat, getting up, falling down, getting up
Who'd fall in love with a chicken with its head cut off?
Woah, nelly! My wife doesn't understand me
Many dozens hope to land me
I'm for free love and I'm in free fall
This could be love or nothing at all But my heart's running 'round like a chicken with its head cut off
All around the barnyard, falling in and out of love
The poor thing's blind as a bat, getting up, falling down, getting up
Who'd fall in love with a chicken with its head cut off? We don't have to be stars exploding in the night, or electric eels under the covers
We don't have to be anything quite so unreal, let's just be lovers Well, my heart's running 'round like a chicken with its head cut off
All around the barnyard, falling in and out of love
The poor thing's blind as a bat, getting up, falling down, getting up
Who'd fall in love with a chicken with its head cut off?
It ain't pretty You can never go back to New York
'Cause it changes as quick as the weather
Everyone sing it together
You can never go back to New York You can go back to Banff or Big Bear
And whatever you loved will still be there
But if you don't plan to ski there
You can never go back to New York You can go out of town for a week
And they move it all round to confuse you
Adding new things to amuse you
Just in case you come back to New York I was only away for six years
And you'd think I'd arrived from Wisconsin
Lots of fresh meat for romancing
Woof, it's fun to go back to New York You can never go back to New York
Anyway, dear, why would you want to?
There's a new New York to move on to
Who would ever go back to New York? You can never go back to New York
'Cause it changes as quick as the weather
Everyone sing it together
You can never go back to New York You can go back to Banff or Big Bear
And whatever you loved will still be there
But if you don't plan to ski there
You can never go back to New York At the dolls' tea party. we fritter away
The long afternoon of a warm summer day
With extended pinkies and pink cloisonné
Cups and saucers and pots and a liberty tray That's why we take our tea at the dolls' tea party At the dolls' tea party, we twitter along
We prattle and tattle on who's done who wrong
On who's thin, who's out and who's best at Mahjong
Oh and where to buy fabulous things for a song That's why we take our tea at the dolls' tea party But the cakes are, the cakes are why everyone's there
They're not diabetic in any way there
Try one and you'll have a few pounds to spare
Try another one, what do you care? At the dolls' we're all in our glittering best
There will be a test on who's best and worst dressed
But we won't have it said we're fashion obsessed
We're just prettier ladies than most of the rest That's why we take our tea at the dolls' tea party Eye contact
Must we make eye contact?
Must we always react
Through frowns and smiles? Let's make a pact
When we must interact
Facing front would distract
From our profiles
Lovely profiles Eye contact
How I hate eye contact!
Having to stare
Exactly, in fact, where? Pretend to care
Where you happen to stare
Break contact if you dare
Haha, I win
Haha, I win Eye contact
For the autodidact
Ever and always smacked
Of smarmy charm Call me barmy
Must we all be warm?
Must all warmth take the form
Of eye contact?
Contact, my eye! This thing is big enough for both of us
It throbs with love enough for two
Bet on the seasons to keep changing
Just like I keep on loving you Maybe you'd learn to like just being loved
Even learn to love me in some way
This heart is big enough for both of us
But you're three thousand miles away (Three thousand miles away)
(Three thousand miles away) There's something big enough for both of us
It's part of my anatomy
You know I'd love to give it all to you
And you can have it all for free First time I saw you, I could feel a stir
Down in my special body part
I would like you to take it in your hand
But please be careful, it's my heart (Three thousand miles away)
(Three thousand miles away)
(Three thousand miles away) This thing is big enough for both of us
It throbs with love enough for two
Bet on the seasons to keep changing
Just like I keep on loving you The first brick the drag king threw
To draw blood from the boys in blue
Said "Here lies Judy Garland" on it
It flew through historic air
Even Taylor Mead was there
And Allen Ginsberg wrote a sonnet One day after the funeral
Stones flew over the Stonewall
Judy Garland
Halfway through her tell-all memoirs
Who flew up into the stars?
Judy Garland
Judy Garland set us free We tried to drive to Woodstock but
Our little blue bug couldn't cut
Through that last hundred miles of traffic
Love still dared not to speak
In l'année érotique
"Je t'aime" was banned as pornographic So put those feather boas on
Drink too much wine
And celebrate the revolution
Of '69 Cause life-sized life never was enough
Who called reality's bluff?
Judy Garland
Patron saint, or victim of love?
Let's try "none of the above"
Judy Garland
Judy Garland set us free Some say its a coincidence
No relation
As if she didn't die for us
Her love nation Halfway through 1969
Who joined Heaven's conga line?
Judy Garland
Sick and tired of being alive
She flew back to Rigel V
Judy Garland Judy Garland set us free
Judy Garland set us free
Judy Garland set us free
So be free with me
Judy Garland set us free
Judy Garland set us free
Judy Garland set us free
So be free with me You won't pluck a robot
Making diddly-squat
This is why I am not a teenager
They all talk down to you
Like they know what to do
Are they trying to screw up your life?
Since they already blew their own But when I grow up
I'm going to run
My own planetarium
I'll make the shows
All on my own
The world will flock to see 'em All that money they got
They don't give you a shot
This is why I am not a teenager
When you never get paid
And you never get laid
And you're full of these stupid hormones
And just then they come out with AIDS But when I grow up
I'm going to be
An underground film maker
I'll have my own
Backlot somewhere
On my own half an acre So they piss on your dreams
Then they muzzle your screams
This is why I am not a teenager
Making ice cream on drugs
Shoveling horse products
Washing dishes and making popcorn
Toilets, oh the indignity! Piss on your dreams
Muzzle your screams
Why I am not a teenager
Piss on your dreams
Muzzle your screams
Piss on your dreams
Muzzle your screams
Why I am not a teenager
Piss on your dreams
Muzzle your screams In the Snow White cottages
As cute as LA gets
In the Norman Tudor
Two doors from the Raveonettes In the Snow White cottages
Every day looks like a myth
In the house once occupied
By singer Elliott Smith
By poor dear Elliott Smith While there, we made a documentary
Concerning my friend Claudia and me
A movie you did not want to be in In the Snow White cottages
It's always 1410
Walt Disney started down the block
The artists lived here then
They lived here even then In the Snow White cottages
I lived just like a prince
It's lovely in Mulholland Drive
And hadn't changed much since
And hasn't changed much since You think I'll run, not walk, to you
Why would I want to talk to you?
I want you crawling back to me
Down on your knees, yeah
Like an appendectomy
Sans anesthesia If you think you can leave the past behind
You must be out of your mind
If you think you can simply press rewind
You must be out of your mind, son
You must be out of your mind You want what you turned off turned on
You call it sunset, now it's dawn
You can't go around just saying stuff
Because it's pretty
And I no longer drink enough
To think you're witty If you think you can leave the past behind
You must be out of your mind
If you think you can simply press rewind
You must be out of your mind, son
You must be out of your mind You want to kindle that old flame
I don't remember your real name
It must be something scandalous
Lurks in your shallows
If you need a Santa Claus
To buy your gallows If you think you can leave the past behind
You must be out of your mind
If you think you can simply press rewind
You must be out of your mind, son
You must be out of your mind They say this city is dirty and gray
But I think it's pretty on a summer day
And on rainy nights
When the streets smudge the lights
It's beautiful, you know But have you seen it in the snow?
When every light has a halo
When it snows all night
And the world glows white
In the morning light, oh
Have you seen it in the snow? They'll tell you this town is an ugly thing
It's all falling down and rebuilding
Neither stars nor sun
And I've never seen one rainbow
For rainbows go to Idaho But have you seen it in the snow?
When every light has a halo
When it snows all night
And the world glows white
In the morning light, oh
Have you seen it in the snow? Make a record
Go to sleep
Make another record in your sleep
Make a record
Go to sleep
Make another record in your sleep Dreaming in Tetris Il faut être absolument New Wave
Il faut être absolument New Wave Dreaming in Tetris Disco music never died
Everything became disco-fied
Disco music never died
Everything became disco-fied Dreaming in Tetris 501s are only pants
Back-to-basics is the death of romance
501s are only pants
Back-to-basics is the death of romance Dreaming in Tetris All the young dudes of 25
Caught diseases, few survived
All the young dudes of 25
Caught diseases, few survived Dreaming in Tetris We expected nuclear war
What should we take precautions for?
We expected nuclear war
What should we take precautions for? Dreaming in Tetris One ten year old was found after three weeks
In a snowdrift ten feet from his door
Some fell asleep in their cars and awakened no more 25 people died shoveling snow
Have that done by somebody you hate
166 looters arrested, but wait I spent the blizzard of '78
On a commune in Northern Vermont
With all the Isaac Asimov anybody could want Music was very much not allowed
So we we said "Hey kids, let's start a band"
Proof that Ganesh loves us
There was no tape deck at hand The first band I'd had was called "One and a Half"
We were a duo, technically
So if Tonto's Expanding Head Band was a band
So were we I spent the blizzard of '78
On a commune in Northern Vermont
With all the Ursula Le Guin any body could want I played guitar, Chris played tin cans
Caroline played tambourine
Chris was 11, Caroline 12, I 13 We called ourselves "the Black Widows"
We weren't the last nor the first
But we were almost certainly by far the worst We made the Cramps sound orchestral
That's an achievement, I guess
As for rehearsal
We made the Shaggs sound like Yes I spent the blizzard of '78
On a commune in Northern Vermont
With all the Roger Zelazny anybody could want Be nice, or come back as a cockroach
Think twice, before being cruel
Those who are unlawful
Will be something awful
When the wheel of life revolves
Flesh dissolves Behave... or demons will devour you
They crave... the meat of bad boys
They find most delicious
The fresh flesh of vicious
Tots who would deny the Lamb
What a scam! How could... one come back as a cockroach?
Why would a spirit eat meat?
I was a dyspeptic
Epileptic skeptic
Other kids ask "why?" at two
I still do I want... to come back as a cockroach
Or haunt some drafty mansion
I'm the kind of chillin'
Wants to be the villain
Always separate from the pack
Dressed in black I'm still... a dreadful goody-goody
Won't kill an innocent flea
From the time I began
I was mostly vegan
Let that little cockroach be
Don't kill me Me and Fred and Dave and Ted
And the dog and the cat and the bugs
All in two rooms with one bed
So we slept on the towels and rugs
But ah! We were young and vaguely in love
And who needed money or drugs?
Not me and Fred and Dave and Ted
And the dog and the cat and the bugs Fred was only twenty-two
So everything he said was true
Sweet as a clumsy puppy dog
But expletive! Could that boy snog Me and Fred and Dave and Ted
And the dog and the cat and the bugs
All in two rooms with one bed
So we slept on the towels and rugs
But ah! We were young and vaguely in love
And who needed money or drugs?
Not me and Fred and Dave and Ted
And the dog and the cat and the bugs Dave offered me the presidency
Of the Log Cabin of New Jersey
I'm not sure who he thought I was
But I smiled and nodded because Me and Fred and Dave and Ted
And the dog and the cat and the bugs
All in two rooms with one bed
So we slept on the towels and rugs
But ah! We were young and vaguely in love
And who needed money or drugs?
Not me and Fred and Dave and Ted
And the dog and the cat and the bugs Ted the All-American male
Had recently got out of jail
For asking money of someone
A John while flourishing a gun Me and Fred and Dave and Ted
And the dog and the cat and the bugs
All in two rooms with one bed
So we slept on the towels and rugs
But ah! We were young and vaguely in love
And who needed money or drugs?
Not me and Fred and Dave and Ted
And the dog and the cat and the bugs I want to be the machine in your hand and go wherever you go
Your every touch would be my command and I wouldn't be so slow
We'd be together in Wonderland and I'd light you with my glow
I want to be the machine in your hand and go wherever you go I don't know why I love you
You're not really a person
More a gadget with meat stuck to it I see less and less of you
As you worsen and worsen
I think you're disappearing through it
No doubt you're just ahead of the curve
I only wish that I had the nerve to say I want to be the machine in your hand and go wherever you go
Your every touch would be my command and I wouldn't be so slow
We'd be together in Wonderland and I'd light you with my glow
I want to be the machine in your hand and go wherever you go You can hold me for hours
Wouldn't that be terrific?
We can feel our connection growing I'll have magical powers
Only less scientific
You and I will become all-knowing
Such a machine, what would it be worth?
Sitck with me kid, we'll conquer the earth I want to be the machine in your hand and go wherever you go
Your every touch would be my command and I wouldn't be so slow
We'd be together in Wonderland and I'd light you with my glow
I want to be the machine in your hand and go wherever you go Is there a man in heaven looking out for you?
Is there a place dead loved ones go?
Is there a source of wisdom that will see you through?
Will there be peace in our time?
No We knew Karmu, a faith healer—the black Christ, he said—
Laying his hands on high and low
Did he cure colds and cancer, and bring back the dead?
Did he refuse donations?
No My friend Scott says there's flying saucers
Hiding inside our hollow moon (Our hollow moon)
And then there's Karl, the card-carrying communist
Cause revolution's coming "soon" (It's coming soon)
And Carolyn believes in fairies
And Gabrielle believes in ghosts
Yeshe believes in reincarnation (We'll meet again)
And David, in heavenly hosts (Heavenly hosts) My mother believes that this physical universe
Is a big holographic show
And she says someday science'll catch up with her
Has she a shred of evidence?
No

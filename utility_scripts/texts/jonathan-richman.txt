She's got a brown suntan starting just above her collar
Her lower arms they're brown, but the rest is kinda pale
She'd buy betadine if she only had a dollar
And she'd live out in the pasture if she only had a tail. And no i don't see her much since she started with horses
No i don't see her much since she started to ride. Well her jeans they get like a wet saddle blanket
And her boots are like you'd figure
And her car is full of hay
Horses, humans if she had to rank it
You'd bet on they that canter
And them that need fly spray And you see i don't see her much since she started with horses
No i don't see her much since she started to ride Go boys, tell 'em all about it! (guitar) Candle and fender, barrel and mein (?)
Don't see her much since she started to train
Cannon (?)bone, knee bone, forearm and arm
I don't see her much when she heads for the barn
And she's so satisfied when she's riding and drinking
She must just love that smell of the barn i would say
She's so satisfied when she's grooming and graining
And she's tired in the evening and she's gone in the day And no i don't see her much since she started with horses
No i don't see her much since she started to ride. If you didn't want me you shouldn't have been born

And may everyone die.

And no one wearing a three piece suit
You meet folks this way you just don't see while flyin
So you take the plane but i'll take the bus this time Well, welfare gal and her drunkin cuss

Salt lake city everybody off

Two whole days on that stinking bus
Yeah and i sleep fine
So you take the plane but i'll take the bus this time. Oooohhh Warm are the winds on the desert
A whirlwind is dancing around
I stopped to survey all the beauty, the tears
When a shadow moves up, across the ground
It's an eagle,
And it circles above me.
And he screams to his friends on the hill
"Stay close together.
Move not a feather.
Man walks among us.
Be still. Be still.
Man walks among us.
Be still." Everything hides, but I see them.
I spotted an old mother quail.
I turn 'round and see,
looking right back at me,
the eyes of a young cotton tail.
Somewhere a coyote sneaking,
As he roams through the brush on the hill.
And the eagle screams down
"Stay close to the ground.
Man walks among us.
Be still. Be still
Man walks among us.
Be still." Soon, will be gone all the desert.
Cities will cover each hill.
Today will just be
A sad memory.
Man walks among us
Be still
Be still
Man walks among us
Be still. I can't stay mad at you You can make me cry
You can break my heart
But I'll never say we're through
Even when I cry, I can't stay mad at you You can run around
You can tell me lies
But there's nothing I can do
I'll never say goodbye
Cause I can't stay mad at you I got mad at you last night
When you were holding another girl tight
But when I thought of all your charms
I bounced back in to your arms One thing you'll know for sure
I won't be the one to fall in love with someone new
I'll love you til I die
And I can't stay mad at you I bounced right back into your arms One thing you'll know for sure
I won't be the one to fall in love with someone new
I'll love you til I die
And I can't stay mad at you You got me where you want me Back in the days of old Rembrandt
Back in the time of Jan Steen
All of them giants of shadow and light
But no one was like Vermeer
Some paintings smell of joy and sweat
Some paintings plain look so fine
And some are sad and passionate
But Vermeer sends a chill up your spine
Yeah Vermeer sends a chill up your spine
Vermeer was eerie
Vermeer was strange
He had his own color range
As if born in a more modern age
What's this a ghost in the gallery
Great Scot the Martians are here
Why are his paintings so unlike the others
Unlike the other ones so near
No one was like Vermeer
Back in the days of Rembrandt
Back in the time of old Jan Steen
All of the masters of shadow and light
But no one was like Vermeer
Vermeer... Jonathan it's late, don't you think that I should go
Naw we were just starting to talk now,
It was just getting good don't you know. But if I leave here in the morning. Yeah.
What will the neighbors tell your wife?
Well my wife knows me by now
So there's no need to let the neighbors run my life.
No, no need to let the neighbors run my life, no no. Well it would look suspicious
And I know why they'd want to know
They love my wife but oh
They don't want her hurt and so... If that's all they see
I wouldn't blame 'em let them go and tell my wife
Cuz my wife should know me by now
So there's no need to let the neighbors run my life.
No, no, no need to let the neighbors run my life, no no. (Guitar) Here we are down the street
Here we are hand in hand. Yeah, so.
You're close to me won't people misunderstand?
That's fair, yeah, they could
If that's all they see,
I wouldn't blame them if they go and tell my wife
But my wife should know me by now
So there's no need to let the neighbors run my life.
No, no need to let the neighbors run my life, no no.

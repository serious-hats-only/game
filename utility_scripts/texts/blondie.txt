Once I had a love and it was divine
Soon found out I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
In between 'what I find is pleasing' and 'I'm feeling fine'
Love is so confusing
There's no peace of mind if I fear I'm losing you
It's just no good, you teasing like you do
Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
Lost inside adorable illusion

Toe to toe
Dancing very close
Barely breathing
Almost comatose
Wall to wall,
People hypnotized
And they're stepping lightly
Hang each night in rapture
Back to back
Sacroiliac
Spineless movement and a wild attack
Face to face
Sadly solitude
And it's finger popping
Twenty-four hour shopping in rapture
Fab Five Freddie told me everybody's fly
DJ's spinnin' are savin' my mind
Flash is fast,
Flash is cool
Francois sais pas, flashe' no do
And you don't stop
Sure shot
Go out to the parking lot
And you get in your car and drive real far
And you drive all night and then you see a light
And it comes right down and lands on the ground
And out comes a man from Mars
And you try to run but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
And then you're in the man from Mars
You go out at night eatin' cars
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercurys and Subarus
And you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars
Then when there's no more cars
You go out at night and eat up bars
Where the people meet
Face to face
Dance cheek to cheek
One to one
Man to man
Dance toe to toe
Don't move too slow
'Cause the man from Mars is through with cars
He's eatin' bars, yeah, wall to wall
Door to door
Hall to hall
He's gonna eat 'em all
Rapture
Be pure
Take a tour through the sewer
Don't strain your brain
Paint a train
You'll be singin' in the rain
I said, "Don't stop, do punk rock"
Well, now you see what you wanna be
Just have your party on TV
'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars
Where the TV's on
Now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race
And you hip-hop and you don't stop
Just blast off
Sure shot
'Cause the man from Mars
Stopped eatin' cars and eatin' bars
And now he only eats guitars
Get up!

She moves like she don't care
Smooth as silk, cool as air
Ooh it makes you wanna cry
She doesn't know your name
And your heart beats like a subway train
Ooh it makes you wanna die
Ooh, don't you wanna take her?
Wanna make her all your own?
Maria, you've gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Latina, Ave Maria
A million and one candle lights
I've seen this thing before
In my best friend and the boy next door
Fool for love and full of fire
Won't come in from the rain
She's oceans running down the drain
Blue as ice and desire
Don't you wanna make her?
Ooh, don't you wanna take her home?
Maria, you've gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Latina, Ave Maria
A million and one candle lights
Ooh, don't you wanna break her?
Ooh, don't you wanna take her home?
She walks like she don't care
You wanna take her everywhere
Ooh, it makes you wanna cry
She's like a millionaire
Walkin' on imported air
Ooh, it makes you wanna die
Maria, you've gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Latina, Ave Maria
A million and one candle lights
Maria, you've gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Latina, Ave Maria
A million and one candle lights
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
I'm not the kind of girl who gives up just like that
Oh, no
It's not the things you do that tease and hurt me bad
But it's the way you do the things you do to me
I'm not the kind of girl who gives up just like that
Oh, no
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one
Every girl wants you to be her man
But I'll wait my dear 'til it's my turn

I love myself; I want you to love me
When I feel down; I want you above me
I search myself; I want you to find me
I forget myself; I want you to remind me
I don't want anybody else
When I think about you I touch myself
Ooh I don't want anybody else Oh no, oh no, oh no
You're the one who makes me come runnin'
You're the sun who makes me shine
When you're around I'm always laughin'
I want to make you mine
I close my eyes and see you before me
Think I would die if you were to ignore me
A fool could see just how much I adore you
I'd get down on my knees; I'd do anything for you
I don't want anybody else
When I think about you I touch myself
ahh ohh i don't want anybody else

When I met you in the restaurant
You could tell I was no debutante
You asked me what's my pleasure
A movie or a measure
I'll have a cup of tea
And tell you of my dreaming
Dreaming is free
Dreaming
Dreaming is free
I don't want to live on charity
Pleasure's real or is it fantasy
Real to real is living rarity
People stop and stare at me
We just walk on by
We just keep on dreaming
Feet, feet, walking a two mile
Meet, meet, meet me at the turnstile
I never met him
I'll never forget him
Dream, dream, even for a little while
Dream, dream, filling up an idle hour
Fade away
Radiate
I sit by and watch the river flow
I sit by and watch the traffic go
Imagine something of your very own
Something you can have and hold
I'd build a road in gold
Just to have some dreaming
Dreaming is free
Dreaming
Dreaming is free
Dreaming
Dreaming is free
Dreaming is free

All I want is a room with a view
a sight worth seeing
a vision of you
All I want is a room with a view
I will give you my finest hour
the one I spent
watching you shower
I will give you my finest hour
All I want is a photo in my wallet
a small rememberance
of something more solid
all I want is a picture of you
Picture this - a day in December
Picture this - feezing cold weather
You got clouds on your lids and you'd be on the skids if it
weren't for your job at the garage
if you could only,
Picture this - a sky full of thunder
Picture this - my telephone number
One and One is what I'm telling you
All I want is 20-20 vision
a total portrait
with no omissions
All I want is a vision of you
If you can...
Picture this - a day in December

You got clouds on your lids and you'd be on the skids if it
weren't for your job at the garage
if you could only,
Picture this - a sky full of thunder
Picture this - my telephone number
One and One is what I'm telling you

I know a girl from a lonely street
Cold as ice cream, but still as sweet
Dry your eyes, Sunday Girl
Hey, I saw your guy with a different girl
Looks like he's in another world
Run and hide, Sunday Girl
Hurry up, hurry up and wait
I stay away all week and still I wait
I got the blues, please come see
What your lovin' means to me
She can't catch up with the working crowd
The weekend mood and she's feeling proud
Live in dreams, Sunday Girl
Baby, I would like to go out tonight
If I go with you my folks will get uptight
Stay at home, Sunday...
(Ooh ooh ooh)
Oh Sunday girl, yes...
how do you call your lovin' man?
I simply say
Baby, woah babe.
My sweet babe
You're the one
Hurry up, hurry up and wait

Oh Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up...

...
Hey, psst psst, here she comes now
Oh, you know her
Would you look at that hair?
Yeah, you know her
Check out those shoes
She looks like she stepped out of
The middle of somebody's blues
She looks like the Sunday comics
She thinks she's Brenda Starr
Her nose job is real atomic
All she needs is an old knife scar
Ehhh, she's so dull, come on, rip her to shreds
She's so dull, come on, rip her to shreds
Oh, you know her
Miss Groupie Supreme
Yeah, you know her
Vera Vogue on Parade
Red eye shadow
Green mascara
(Yuck!)
She's too much
She looks like she don't know better
A case of partial extreme
Dressed in a Robert Hall sweater
Acting like a soap opera queen
Ehhh, she's so dull, come on, rip her to shreds
She's so dull, come on, rip her to shreds
She got the nerve to tell me she's not on it
But her expression is too serene
Yeah, she looks like she washes with Comet
Always looking to create a scene
Ehhh, she's so dull, come on rip her to shreds
She's so dull, come on rip her to shreds
She's so dull, rip her to shreds
Oh, you know her
Miss Groupie Supreme
Yeah, you know her
Vera Vogue on Parade
Yeah, you know her
With the fish eating grin
She's so dull
Yeah, she got the nerve to tell me
Huh, she's so dull
Yeah, there she goes now
She makin' out with King Kong
She take her boat to Hong Kong
Well, bye bye sugar
And not a minute too soon
Oh Denis, ooh-be-do, I'm in love with you

Denis, Denis, I'm so in love with you
Oh when we walk it always feels so nice
And when we talk, it seems like paradise
Denis, Denis, I'm so in love with you
You're my king and I'm in heaven every time I look at you
When you smile it's like a dream
And I'm so lucky, 'cause I found a boy like you
Denis, Denis, avec tes yeux si bleus
Denis, Denis, Quand j'ai peche' pour deux
Denis, Denis, Pour un baiser d'eternite'

I'm in the phone booth, it's the one across the hall
If you don't answer, I'll just ring it off the wall
I know he's there, but I just had to call
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone
I heard your mother, now she's going out the door
Did she go to work or just go to the store?
All those things she said, I told you to ignore
Oh, why can't we talk again?
Oh, why can't we talk again?
Oh, why can't we talk again?
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone
It's good to hear your voice, you know it's been so long
If I don't get your calls then everything goes wrong
I want to tell you something you've known all along
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone
I had to interrupt and stop this conversation
Your voice across the line gives me a strange sensation
I'd like to talk when I can show you my affection
Oh, I can't control myself
Oh, I can't control myself
Oh, I can't control myself
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone
Hang up and run to me
(Ohh)
Hang up and run to me
(Ohh)
Hang up and run to me
(Ohh)
Hang up and run to me
(Ohh, woh, woh, woh)
Run to me, yeah
Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out to be a thing of the past
Seemed like the real thing only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
Once I had a love and it was divine
Soon found out I was losing my mind
Seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
In between, "What I find is pleasing" and "I'm feeling fine"
Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losing you, it's just no good
You teasing like you [Incomprehensible]
Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out to be a thing of the past
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
Lost inside adorable illusion and I cannot hide
I'm the one you're using, please don't push me aside
We coulda made it cruising, yeah
Yeah, riding high on love's true bluish light
Ooh, ooh, ooh, whoa
Ooh, ooh, ooh, whoa
Ooh, ooh, ooh, whoa
Ooh, ooh, ooh, whoa
Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out to be a pain in the ass
Seemed like the real thing only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
Ooh, ooh, ooh, whoa
Ooh, ooh, ooh, whoa
Ooh, ooh, ooh, whoa
Oh, oh, what are we gonna do?
Union, Union, Union City blue
Tunnel to the other side
It becomes daylight
I say he's mine
Oh power, passion plays a double hand
Union, Union Union City man
Arrive, climb up four flights
To the orange side
Rearrange my mind
In turquoise Union, Union, Union City blue
Skyline, passion, Union City blue
Power, passion plays a double hand
Union, Union, Union City man
I say he's mine
I have a plan
I say he's my Union City man
Oh, oh, what are we gonna do?
Union, Union, Union City blue
You and I in a little toy shop
buy a bag of balloons with the money we've got
Set them free at the break of dawn
'Til one by one, they were gone
Back at base, bugs in the software
Flash the message, "Something's out there"
Floating in the summer sky
99 red balloons go by.
99 red balloons floating in the summer sky
Panic bells, it's red alert
There's something here from somewhere else
The war machine springs to life
Opens up one eager eye
Focusing it on the sky
Where 99 red balloons go by.
99 Decision Street, 99 ministers meet
To worry, worry, super-scurry
Call the troops out in a hurry
This is what we've waited for
This is it boys, this is war
The president is on the line
As 99 red balloons go by.
99 (Neunundneunzig) Kriegsminister
Streichholz und Benzinkanister
hielten sich fr schlaue Leute
witterten schon fette Beute
riefen: "Krieg", und wollten Macht
Mann, wer htte das gedacht
da es einmal soweit kommt
wegen 99 Luftballons
99 dreams I have had
In every one a red balloon
It's all over and I'm standin' pretty
In this dust that was a city
If I could find a souvenier
Just to prove the world was here...
And here is a red balloon
I think of you and let it go.
Hey, j'ai vu ton mec avec une autre fille
Il semblait dans un autre monde
Cours te cacher Sunday girl
Quand je t'ai revu l'칠te j'ai decid칠
Si ton amour 칠tait pareil au mien
Je pourrais 칡tre Sunday girl
D칠p칠che-toi, d칠p칠che-toi et attends
Toute la semaine absent et pourtant j'attends
J'ai le cafard, je t'en prie viens voir
Ce que ton amour represente pour moi
D칠p칠che-toi, d칠p칠che-toi et attends
Toute la semaine absent et pourtant j'attends
J'ai le cafard, je t'en prie viens voir
Ce que ton amour represente pour moi
I got the blues
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up and wait
Hurry up, please come see what you do to me
I'll never fall in love again.
I'll never fall in love again.
I fell in love before and he walked though the door.
I'll never fall in love.
I'll never fall in love again.
I'll never fall in love, oh no.
I'll never give my heart to you.

I gave you my heart and you tore it all apart.
I'll never fall in love.
I'll never fall in love again.
I'll never fall in love.
I'll never fall in love.
Oh no no no no ah.
I fell in love before then he walked through the door.

I'll never fall in love with you again.
With you again.
With you again.
With you again.
Alright, you maggots, get it up
Do you love me, I can't hear you
Pick em up and put em down, you're in the army now
We'll make a man of you and then a soldier too
Shoulders back and stomach in, we'll teach you discipline
Mother's sons and father's daughters, shut it up and follow orders
Study up on weaponry, the M-16 the M-15
Sammy knows the enemy, flim flam big slam
Tell the major what you see, hut, hut, hut, hut
Ayattolah, rock the house, book 'em in with Minnie Mouse
Donald Duck is going red, Goofy's working for the Feds
Eight ball in the side pocket, I just shot my last rocket
I'm coming back, they're on my tail, aren't you glad I escaped from jail
Bangkok rocks, Bangkok rocks, girls on the strip it's a one way trip
Bangkok rocks, Patpong, Patpong, Patpong, Bangkok rocks
Soldiers dine for free Nato's, up a tree tours at nine and three
Go now, pray late,r it's a lay-away plan, free vacation in Iran
Stop and see the middle east miles and miles of lovely beach
Get that copper tone tan on radioactive sand
Those at home just got a directive, all report to the neighborhood
Collective ten hours a day, making makeup
So the girls at the front can be more protected
If I die on the Russian front, bury me with Russian mud
If they drop us in the east, stand up, hook off, off your seat
Satellites are falling down tonight
I see you far away
I'm floating into this inescapable bliss
Changing light, I know the symptoms of
I got myself to blame
I'm needing you, I just don't care anymore
Good boys never win
Good boys always follow
Good boys never win
They all fall away and you remain
Fear of flight
I'm so afraid of heights
Why are you asking why
I'm walking but my feet are never touching the ground
Good boys never win
Good boys always follow
Good boys never win
They all fall away and you remain
Eyes wide in the middle of the night
Got more money than a body got right
Riding on the L 'til the sun comes up again
You got me on your face
A big disgrace
Shakin' your feathers all over the place
You woke face down on St. Marks Avenue
What a pity for you
What a pity for you
What a pity for you
Good boys
What a pity for you


The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
I'm not the kind of girl who gives up just like that
Oh, no
It's not the things you do that tease and wound me bad
But it's the way you do the things you do to me
I'm not the kind of girl who gives up just like that
Oh, no
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one, number one
Every girl wants you to be her man
But I'll wait my dear 'til it's my turn
I'm not the kind of girl who gives up just like that
Oh, no
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one, number one
Every girl wants you to be her man
But I'll wait my dear 'til it's my turn
I'm not the kind of girl who gives up just like that
Oh, no
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one, number one, number one
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one...
We fell in love down at the pier.
You were sunbathing, I was around.
Soon we were sharing a beer.
We fell in love at the pier.
I'm no sentimental slob so don't think I'm queer .
You got somethin' baby, and it ain't just my beer.
Well, maybe it's the hot pants, maybe the heat, or was it the sneakers you kicked of your feet?
I sat under my umbrella to keep my pearly skin.
You tanned your oily body looking like sin.
Well, soon I was sweatin' and I wanted to leave.
You slipped into the water from to much grease.
Well, I saw you yelling.
I just couldn't hear, so I screamed back at ya "Honey keep the beer!"
We never consummated our outside love affair.
Too much tar and water.
Too much hot air.
Oh, what a tragic end to love that was lost.
We would have stood a chance if we met in the frost, but...
We fell in love down at pier.
You were sunbathing, I was around.
Now I go to beaches with my girlfriend.
No more love splinters in my rear end.
I know I fucked up
It isn't like it's the first time it's happened
You didn't give me time for anybody else
I know I'm lazy
But this is how I'm wired
I know you don't trust me
But I won't say I'm sorry
I screwed up
I'll do it better on the flipside
I've gotta do it over
I've gotta do it over
I'll make it up
I'll do it better on the flipside
I screwed up
I screwed up
I got so wasted
I was blowing kisses at your mother
I thought that she was Johnny Depp in drag
I know I'm crazy
But I was so inspired
The memory is hazy
But I won't say I'm sorry
I screwed up
I'll do it better on the flipside
I've gotta do it over
I've gotta do it over
I'll make it up
I'll do it better on the flipside
I screwed up
I screwed up
Screw off
I'll bury my head in the sand
Screw off, screw off
Get lost
You call I won't come on command
Get lost, get lost
I screwed up
I'll do it better on the flipside
I've gotta do it over
I've gotta do it over
I'll make it up
I'll do it better on the flipside
I screwed up
I screwed up
I screwed up
I screwed up
I screwed up
I screwed up
Stars live in the evening, but the very young need the sun.
Pretty baby, you look so heavenly.
A neo nebula from under the sun.
I was forming, some say I had my chance.
The boys were falling like an avalanche.
Ya ya baby, "La Dolce Vita" is a magic dance.
No one was listening.
Pretty baby, petite ingenue, teenage starlet, I fell in love with you.
You, you with the comb... you look ok in every way.
Ah... I, I should have known you'd look at me and look away, oh.
Pretty baby, you look so heavenly.
A neo nebula from under the sun.
Eyes that tell me "incense and peppermints"
Your looks are larger than life.
Long live innocence.
Petite ingenue, I fell in love with you.
One way, or another, I'm gonna find ya
I'm gonna get ya get ya get ya get ya
One way, or another, I'm gonna win ya
I'm gonna get ya get ya get ya get ya
One way, or another, I'm gonna see ya
I'm gonna meet ya meet ya meet ya meet ya
One day, maybe next week
I'm gonna meet ya, I'm gonna meet ya, I'll meet ya
I will drive past your house
And if the lights are all down
I'll see who's around
One way, or another, I'm gonna find ya
I'm gonna get ya get ya get ya get ya!
One way, or another, I'm gonna win ya
I'll get ya! I'll get ya!
One way, or another, I'm gonna see ya
I'm gonna meet ya meet ya meet ya meet ya!
One day, maybe next week, I'm gonna meet ya
I'll meet ya! Ahhh...
And if the lights are all out
I'll follow your bus downtown
See who's hangin' 'round!
One way, or another, I'm gonna lose ya
I'm gonna give you the slip!
A slip of the hip for another
I'm gonna lose ya, I'm gonna trick ya!
I'll trick ya!
One way, or another, I'm gonna lose ya
I'm gonna trick ya trick ya trick ya trick ya!
One way, or another, I'm gonna lose ya
I'm gonna give you the slip!
I walked down the mall
Stand over by the wall
Where I can see it all
Or find out who ya call!
Lead you to the supermarket checkouts
Some specials and rat food
Get lost in the crowd
One way, or another, I'm gonna get ya
I'll get ya, I'll get ya get ya get ya get ya!
(Where I can see it all, find out who ya call)
One way, or another, I'm gonna get ya
I'll get ya, I'll get ya get ya get ya get ya!
(Where I can see it all, find out who ya call)
One way, or another, I'm gonna get ya
II'll get ya, I'll get ya get ya get ya get ya!
(Where I can see it all, find out who ya call)
One way, or another, I'm gonna get ya
I'll get ya, I'll get ya get ya get ya get ya!
(Where I can see it all, find out who ya call)
One way, or another, I'm gonna get ya
I'll getcha, I'll get ya get ya get ya get ya!
(Where I can see it all, find out who ya call)
One way, or another, I'm gonna get ya
I'll get ya, I'll get ya get ya get ya get ya!
(Where I can see it all, find out who ya call)
One way, or another
As I sit staring into this liquid amber, ripples move out to the edge of the glass.
Is that really your reflection in there?
I just wanna jump into the warm depths and be there with you, one more time!
Oh, alright.
Hit it boys!
My initials sprayed across a pavement cut into your private interview.
Talk to me now.
Step into my room, we'll have a word or two.
If I ever had a million dollars and if I didn't give it all to you would you lose interest?
Show me indifference?
Foot in another shoe?
Not very high heels.
Not wearing sneakers too.
A magazine ad, a printed canvas, a basic new shade blue suede shoe.
Thought I'd like to have a little party.
Thought I'd like to have a little do.
Sure I stopped drinking but for the moment, honey, here's looking at you!
I'll stop my drinking (give you my promise true), clean out the closet, be existential, and cast a vote for the president too.
But for the action of the moment, nothing does what it ought to do.
Instant depression, I learned my lesson, nothing that I'd rather do.
Come on over my place.
Can't see him sideways.
Honey, here's looking at you.
Heartache, heartache
Heartache from the best day ever
Breakup, makeup
Breakup, this will go on forever
Breakup, breakdown
Take a break and we get back together
Last day, last day
This is the last day
We get the best day ever
I hope it's enough to give my love
To get on with this breakup
Just leave me your heart as you walk out the door
I'll keep it on the tub
And don't turn around if you love me
You let me be, let me be, baby
And maybe we'll fight down the line
If we love ice it won't hurt too much
Don't cry, don't cry
Tonight, it was the best day ever
Goodbye, we cry
We're tired, tired of forever
Kiss me, miss me
Cut my, cut my tether
Last day, last day
Last day, make it the best day ever
I hope it's enough to give my love
To get on with this breakup
Just leave me your heart as you walk out the door
I'll keep it on the tub
And don't turn around if you love me
You let me be, let me be, baby
And maybe we'll fight down the line
If we love ice it won't hurt too much
I love my magnet we were taking out of time
That we should never met, never met, never met, never met
Thank God we met
I hope it's enough, oh, to give my love
To get on with this breakup
Just leave me your heart as you walk out the door
I'll keep it on the tub
And don't turn around if you love me
You let me be, let me be, baby
And maybe we'll fight down the line
If we love ice it won't hurt too much
And don't turn around if you love me
You let me be, let me be, baby
And maybe we'll fight down the line
If we love ice it won't hurt too much
The lines I have written that you read between
The lines on the pages
The lines on the screen
Of lines spoken - I say what I mean.
It's parallel lines that will never meet.
Ship in the desert
Ships in the night
Ships that pass in the night.
Evangeline stream - Evangeline's dream,
It's parallel lines that will never meet.
It's not the way that I want, it's just the way it is
Beyond the limit, beyond the limit
The landlord says he's gonna renovate the walls
Be prepared for a little noise but then the ceiling falls
So ya try to sleep with the pillow on your head
Toss, turn, start to burn, top floor lands in bed
You watch TV but there's nothing on the screen
Spotlight on the visual, nothing on the beam
Call the handy man to come fix your machine
He tells ya now your kitchen works but all your toast is green
That's the way it is, that's the way it really, really is
Beyond the limit, beyond the limit out there
That takes me away
Toe to toe
Dancing very slow
Barely breathing
Almost comatose
Wall to wall
People hypnotized
And they're stepping
Lightly
Hang each night in
Rapture
Back to back
Sacrailiac
Spinless movement
And a wild attack
Face to face
Sadly solitude
And it's finger
Popping
Twenty-four hour shopping
In Rapture
Fat fine Freddie
Told me everybody's high
DJ's spinnin'
Are savin' my mind
Flash is fast, flash is cool
Francois sez fas
Flashe' no do
And ya don't stop
Sure shot
Go out to the parking lot
And ya get in your car
And ya drive real far
And ya drive all night
And then ya see a light
And it comes right down
And lands on the ground
And out comes a man from Mars
And ya try to run
But he's got a gun
And he shoots ya dead
And he eats your head
And then you're in the man from Mars
You go out at night, eatin' cars
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercurys and Subarus
And ya don't stop
You keep on eatin' cars
Then, when there's no more cars
You go out at night and eat up bars
Where the people meet
Face to face
Dance cheek to cheek
One to one
Man to man
Dance toe to toe
Don't move too slow
'Cause the man from Mars
Is through with cars
He's eatin' bars
Yeah, wall to wall
Door to door
Hall to hall
He's gonna eat 'em all
Rapture
Be pure
Take a tour
Through the sewer
Don't strain your brain
Paint a train
You'll be singin' in the rain
I said don't stop
Do punk rock
Well now you see
What ya wanna be
Just have your party on TV
'Cause the man from Mars
Won't eat up bars
Where the TV's on
And now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race
And ya hip-hop
And ya don't stop
Just blast off
Sure shot
'Cause the man from Mars
Stopped eatin' cars
And eatin' bars
And now he only eats guitars
Get up!
1 2 3!
Down in Chinatown the year of the cock
He sold the silver belt, put it in hock
Fistful of money, mouth full of gold
Soon to be free of all armful of holes
She was a kung fu girl, kung fu girl
He got the address symbolized in Cantonese
Then asked a native, "Some assistance, please,"
She took him to the secret door
He was kissing the floor, don't know much more
She was a kung fu girl, kung fu girl
Heng lu Cindy Sue
Difo difong hacking hu
In a flash of recollection of oriental pride
She threw him to the side
Got the address, gave the door a knock
What happened next caused quite a shock
She was standing, looking out the door
He was kicked to the floor, don't know much more
She was a kung fu girl, kung fu girl
Kung fu
Cindy Sue
Oh, I wanna get close to you
You're my kung fu girl
You're my kung fu girl
Oh my oriental pearl
Kung fu
Cindy Sue
Oh, I wanna get close to you
You're my kung fu girl
You're my kung fu girl, get down
Far from day, far from night
Out of time, out of sight
In between earth and sea
We shall fly, follow me
Dry the rain, warm the snow
Where the winds never go
Follow me, follow me
Follow me
To a cave by a sapphire shore
Where we'll walk through an emerald door
And for thousands of breathless
Evermore my life you will be
Only you, only I
World farewell, world goodbye
To our home 'neath the sea
We shall fly, follow me
Only you, only I
World farewell, world goodbye
To our home 'neath the sea
We shall fly, follow me
Follow me
Follow me
Follow me
Follow me
Give 'em no hope, no tenderness, no holiness, no sensitivity, no love, no heart, no imagination, no compassion.
No talking just head!
I cannot be dead!
I will be in your head, you will be on your knees.
You'll be begging me, "please make it fucking stop!"
No peace of mind, no serenity, no mercy mild, no divinity.
You will give them no quarter, no inspiration.
Isolation.
No talking just head!
That's what I said.
I will be in your head and you'll be down on your knees begging me, "please..."
Sometimes I feel, sometimes I feel like a motherfuckingless child.
Grease it up good.
Work it back and forth.
You don't even know who I am.
Think of the good things, remember the bad.
No illusions.
No talking just head!
I cannot be dead!
When you pull the switch I will be in your head, greasin' it up good.
No talking just head!
You've been misled!
I will be in your head, workin' it back and forth like I knew that I would.
No tenderness, no compassion, no sensitivity, no love, no holiness, no spirituality, no imagination, no heart, no divinity, no charity, no mercy, no hope, no karma, no devotion, no immorality, no soul.
No talking just head!
I cannot be dead!
I will be in your head, you will be down on your knees and you'll be beggin' me, "please make it fucking stop!"
Every day you've got to wake up and disappear behind your makeup
Take away your calendar watch and you can't keep track until your heart attack
Hey, I'm living in a magazine, page to page in my submarine!
Hey now, Cindy, you can't get to me, need an elevator
Hey, I'll see you later, 'cause I'm not living in the real world
I'm not living in the real world
I'm not living in the real world, no more, no more
Yeah
I can be whatever I want to
I talk to me, I even agree
Every day's a holiday
You can look through the glass and take a photograph
You will never ever walk on the moon, leave your body and float through the room
You could never conquer me, 'cause I'm not here and you're not there
And, and I'm not living in the real world
I'm not living in the real world
I'm not living in the real world, no more, no more
Yeah
Didn't I ever tell you I was gone?
Didn't I ever tell you I was gone?
Bye bye!
I can do anything at all
I'm invisible and I'm twenty feet tall
Pull the plug on your digital clock and it all goes dark and the bodies stop
Hey, I'm living in a magazine, page to page in my teenage dream
Hey, now, Mary, you can't follow me, without a satellite
I'm on a power flight, 'cause I'm not living in the real world
I'm not living in the real world
I'm not living in the real world, no more, no more
I'm not living in the real world
I'm not living in the real world
I'm not living in the real world, no more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more
You can't create more time. You just make it.
If you want a new life, just take it.
And if you want to change the world, then speak real clear
And make sure someone's listening (listening)
And if you want to break my heart, then stay right here
Yeah don't go anywhere
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Everything comes in pieces
Do you love me yet?
Fucking prove it.
Try to ask yourself
Are you really different?
Know that your life is more frightening than writing a song.
It's an action of fractions you're passing along
And these oceans of emotion will crash once they hit the shore
I promise you
And it's the closest I will get to sincerity.
Every praise I make just looks so fake and crude to me
And it's the closest I will come to purity.
Simulations never follow me.
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
My heart is made up of pieces
Do you get it yet?
Can't you see through this?
You know all too well
You cannot make things perfect
No, I'll be shifting through lists of these possible loves
With this pain in my brain. It feels scattered like doves
Though the sky where my eyes have been drifting towards recently
And it's the closest I can be to egocentricity.
This overwhelming sense of rejection will sneak behind and tear at me
And it'll slam me to the ground into reality
And I'll deal with my disparity.
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Why don't you love me now?
Why don't you love me now?
This is where I fall down shattered on the floor
As I'm swept around with a million pieces more
Of myself I once learned to lose
Though it never helped me forget the truth
The truth
The truth
The truth...
This is where I fall down shattered on the floor
As I'm swept around with a million pieces more
Of myself I once learned to lose
Though it never helped me forget the truth
The truth
The truth
The truth...
O Don't ya know
Don't wanna see ya any more
Put up or shut up
Ya spell, ya read,
D.O.O.R.
Ya got a big mouth and I'm happy to see
Your foot is firmly entrenched where a molar should be
If you talk much louder you could get an award
From the Federal Communication Board
Don't be cruel
Be a thing - sweet thing
As a rule
Don't be sad
I left you in the street
You're pre-tab
I had to get away
Chorus:
Don't go away sad
Don't go pre-tab
Don't go be bad
Don't go away mad, just go away
O Don't ya know
Don't wanna see ya here no more
Pack it and move it
Ya spell, ya read, O.U.T. out
Don't be bad
A mad hatter's beret
Sometimes you look like you just made an escape
Don't be mad
Or lose your medicaid cool
Of course cool rhymes with fool
Don't go be bad
Cause you been had
Don't go away sad
Don't go away mad, just go away
O Don't ya know
Don't wanna see ya curse and pout
Pack it and move it
Ya spell, ya read, O.U.T. out
You got a big mouth and I'm happy to see
Your foot is firmly entrenched where a molar should be
Don't be mad or lose your medicaid cool
Of course cool rhymes with fool
Leaning in your corner like a candidate for wax
Sidewalk social scientist don't get no satisfaction from your cigarette
It's 10 to 10, time is running out
Lock up all your memories, get outta here, you know that we can run
Today can last another million years
Today could be the end of me
It's 11: 59, and I want to stay alive
Pumping like a fugitive in cover from the night
Take it down the freeway like a bullet to the ocean
Wait until the morning, take tomorrow by the hand
Take it down the highway like a rocket to the ocean, we can run
Today can last another million years
Today could be the end of me
It's 11: 59, and I want to stay alive
Hanging on a frequency, burning like a fire
Boy, you've got the motion down, it's getting late, I'm tired and I've lost control
Don't leave me here, time is running out
Take me down the highway like a rocket to the ocean, we can run
Today can last another million years
Today could be the end of me
It's 11: 59, and I want to stay alive
Clear as a bell and an echoing shell
Clear as a pane of glass
I realize, I can't revise
As clear as a big blue sky
Through and through and all
You're trying to stall
as clear as a crystal ball
As the facets are bold and platinum and gold
Clear as a flawless diamond
I'm hitting the wall
I know I'm gonna fall for you
Is it my fate or fatal attraction
Could it be a fait accomplit?
Oh! Is it doom or destiny?
Oh! Is it doom or destiny?
Dark as a winter's moonless night
Dark as a velvet cape
I realize, I can't revise
As dark as the other side
I can recommend but I can't defend
As dark as a deep sea trench
I was stuck in a tar pit having a shit fit
Dark as an angry inch
Ah, I can't wait you're are an out-of-state plate oh
It's creepy fate or fatal attraction
Could it be a fait accomplit?
Oh! Is it doom or destiny?
Oh! Is it doom or destiny?
Oh! Is it doom or destiny?
Oh! Is it doom or destiny?
Oh! Is it doom or destiny?
Oh! Is it doom or destiny?
Oh! Is it doom or destiny?
Oh! Is it doom or destiny?
In love with love.
In love with a passionate heart.
In love with love.
In love even when we're apart.
I wondered the difference of how it could last.
I heard the celebration of champagne in glass.
No wonder, it's no wonder why I'm in love with love.
In love with a passionate heart.
In love with love.
In love with the form of the art.
We love through the fighting of everyday life, of glass that gets broken and cuts like a knife.
I wonder and I wonder why I'm in love with love.
In love with a passionate heart.
In love with love then on with the delicate march.
Heart of fire.
House of fire.
In love with love.
In love with a passionate heart.
In love with love.
On fire with a passionate heart.
Ablaze with reflection, our hot house is set blazing with a flaming with a fire.
It's so passionately racing with a chaser.
it's so hard to keep my wits about me!
Ooh baby, I hear how you spend night-time:
Wrapped like candy in a pure blue neon glow.
Fade away and radiate.
Fade away and radiate.
Ooh baby, watchful lines vibrate soft in brainwave time.
Silver pictures move so slow.
Golden tubes faintly glow.
Electric faces seem to merge.
Hidden voices mock your words.
Fade away and radiate.
Fade away and radiate.
Beams become my dream.
My dream is on the screen.
The beams become my dream.
My dream is on the screen.
Dusty frames that still arrive
Die in nineteen fifty-five.
Fade away and radiate.
Fade away and radiate.
The beam becomes my dream.
My dream is on the screen.
Fade away and radiate.
Fade away and radiate.
Fade away and radiate.
Fade away and radiate.
When I gave up on you I took my time
Waiting for reasons to change my mind
But there were none
My fever won, so it was clear to me
That we should be done
Even though it was breaking my heart
You were perfect at the start
So right, that's why
Goodbye, so hard to say
And that's the reason
I hadn't known that he walked away
Away
When I gave up on you, I gave up slowly
Waiting for reasons to keep us going
But there were none
Not even one, so it was clear to me
That we should be done
Even though it was breaking my heart
You were perfect at the start
So right and that's why
Goodbye, so hard to say
And that's the reason
I hadn't known that he walked away
Away
I tried hard as I could
Sometimes people try harder than they should
Than they should
We were one in a million galaxies
One in a million wasn't good enough for me
We were one in a million and you know it's true
One in a million wasn't good enough for you
When I gave up on you I took my time
Waiting for reasons to change my mind
But there were none
But there were none
Goodbye, so hard to say
And that's the reason
I hadn't known that he walked away
Away
I tried hard as I could
Sometimes people try harder than they should
Than they should
Oh, I don't want you to go!
Oh, please don't leave me alone!
Oh!
No, I don't want you to go!
Oh, please don't leave me alone!
Oh!
Dear Annett,
Soon I'll be with you before they know, before the show.
I'm not a whore. I dance no more. I'll be with you across the border, dearest Anastasia. I'm leaving soon.
I'm sorry too, but burn this letter. Burn my picture. They won't know I've crossed the border.
Love, Victor.
Oh, I don't want you to go!
Oh, don't leave me alone!
Oh!
(Want to hear something else?)
Ooh, it's so good, it's so good, it's good, it's so good
Ooh, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm love, I'm in love
Ooh, I feel love, I feel love, I feel love, I feel love
I feel love
I feel love
I feel love
I feel
Ooh, I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel
Ooh, you and me, you and me, you and me
Ooh, I feel love, I feel love, I feel love, I feel love

I feel love
I feel love
I feel
Ooh, it's so good, it's so good, it's good, it's so good
Ooh, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm love, I'm in love
Ooh, I feel love, I feel love, I feel love, I feel love
I feel love
I feel love
I feel love
I feel
In the beginning, in the days before time, the light was alive with the essense of power.
And from that power were born beings who lived on the edge of eternity.
And they spread their wings and soared through the ancient air.
And the beating of their wings made the winds.
And from the winds came the seas.
And from the sea came the life of the earth.
Nature's cast upon the sea the winds of past, of promise be.
Waters deep uncover me.
A scheme of sleep as lovers three.
If you'll forgive me my ferocity, I won't forget your sweetness.
Pull down the night, lay it before me.
Gratify my head with curses.
Night recalls tranquility.
A curtain falls and sets it free.
Darkness calls eternity.
Down silent halls the shadows flee.
If you'll forgive me my ferocity, I won't forget your sweetness.
Pull down the night, lay it before me.
Satisfy my head with curses.
Forgive and forget.
Forgive and forget.
Forgive and forget.
Fates are cast upon the sea.
The winds of past of promise be.
Waters deep uncover me.
A scheme of sleep as lovers three.
Forgive and forget.
Forgive and forget.
Louie Louie
Oh no, so here I go
Louie, Louie
Oh baby, here I go
And my little boy is waiting for me
That's the boy, across the way
When he's waiting, he's all alone
When I see him I'm gonna take him home
Louie Louie
Oh no, so here I go
Louie, Louie
Oh baby, here I go now
And my little boy is waiting for me
That's the boy, across the way
When he's waiting, he's all alone
When I see him I'm gonna take him home
Louie Louie
Oh no, so here I go
Louie, Louie
Oh baby, here I go
Oh here I go
Uh-ah
Uh-ah
Well you know Louie Louie is a very traditional song
Ahhh?.
Louie Louie, fuck
Louie Louie one more time
Yeah, Louie Louie again
Louie Louie
Oh no, so here I go
Louie, Louie
Oh baby, here I go
Oh here I go
Here I go
(repeat)
Some days are all Mondays
Sort of time on ice
It seems like jet planes
On snowed in runways
Under clear blue skies
Who needs it?
Nothing is real but the girl
Nothing is real but her
Money goes to money
In a figure eight around me
Mommy
Who's gonna love me if I liquidate and drown me?
Nothing is real but the girl
Nothing else feels solid
We believe in love
We believe in little things
Like heaven up above and seven it's a lucky number
We believe that something lives inside every thing there is
Don't think about it much
I mean it
I believe it
I believe it
Wind down
Put your mind down
Like your missing school
You'll teach her to find out
While your dying
In your living room
How much you need her
Nothing is real but the girl
Only her eyes are solid
Nothing is real but her
Nothing is real but the girl
Love is a burning thing
It makes a fire ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell into, a ring of fire
Taste, my love sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Ohh, the fire went wild
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
The flame swept higher
And it burns, burns, burns
That ring of fire, that ring of fire
I've been running circles 'round a night that never ends
I've been chasing heartache, in a city and a friend
I've been with you so long, even seen you lose it, but who cares?
Racing down The Bowery, on a crowded afternoon
Tripping from The Davenport above your insecure typhoon
Can you even want me, or is this just a way to keep you safe?
Take me, then lose me, then tell them I'm yours
Are you, happy?
Does it take you a long time?
Does it make you upset?
Does it make you think everybody wants to be your friend?
I can give you a heartbeat, I can give you a friend
I can make you think everybody wants to be your friend
Drinking with your cell phone with a smile on your face
Happy in success, but still a thousand miles away
Is this what you wanted, is this everything you had in store?
Take me, then lose me, then tell them I'm yours
Are you, happy?
Does it take you a long time
Does it make you upset
Does it make you think everybody wants to be your friend
I can give you a heartbeat, I can give you a friend
I can make you think everybody wants to be your friend
Take me, then lose me, then tell them I'm yours
Are you, happy?
I've been running circles 'round a night that never ends
I've been chasing heartache, in a city and a friend
I've been with you so long, even seen you lose it, but who cares?
Does it take you a long time?
Does it make you upset?
Does it make you think everybody wants to be your friend?
I can give you a heartbeat, I can give you a friend
I can make you think everybody wants to be your friend
Take me, then lose me, then tell them I'm yours
Take me, then lose me, then tell them I'm yours
Take me, then lose me, then tell them I'm yours
Take me, then lose me, then tell them I'm yours
Uno, dos, uno dos tres quatro
Hey, now honey, I'm about to begin
Hear the intention near me again
Been to impatient and I'm ready to spill
So tired of waiting for my turn to thrill
Trying to fly, trying to get a break
A space to move and a movement to make
Triangle toes, two loves continue
Why in the world? I'm a circular girl
Ooh, baby I feel the spin
Turning me round and round
Taking me out of town
Ooh, I feel the spin
Messing me round and round
Making my madness drown
Hey, now honey, my rotations set in
To a driving dimension, do it again
Hey, I'm standing on top of the world
Grinning and spinning, free as a bird
I'm dizzy from pressure, I hold out for pleasure
A space to move and some music to make
I'm spellbound from watching your radio hula
Hips over me, oh, I'm a circular girl
Ooh, baby I feel the spin
Turning me round and round
Taking me out of town
Ooh, I feel the spin
Messing me round and round
Making my madness drown
Ooh, I feel the spin
Taking me round and round
Throwing me out of bounds
Ooh, I feel the spin
Throwing me around
I'm dizzy from pressure, I hold out for pleasure
A space to move and some music to make
I'm spellbound from watching your radio hula
Hips over me, oh, I'm a circular girl
Ooh, baby I feel the spin
Turning me round and round
Taking me out of town
Ooh, I feel the spin
Messing me round and round
Making my madness drown
Ooh, I feel the spin
Taking me round and round
Throwing me out of bounds
Ooh, baby I feel the spin
Throwing me around
Driving me out of town
Same old song and dance
I gave you another chance
Drama every night.
I don't wanna fight
Same old story again
You wanna be my friend
It's really gotta end
Same old story
You told me you were done with her
and I believed every word
and now I wonder what I heard... ooooh!
You told me you were done with her
and I believed every word
and now I wonder what I heard... ooooh!
The drama won't stop,
he says he called the cops
police don't care 'cause he's crazy
You keep calling me
I've heard it all before,
It's a total bore,
cat got out,
he came running back for more.
You told me you were done with her
and I believed every word
and now I wonder what I heard... ooooh!
You told me you were done with her
and I believed every word
and now I wonder what I heard... ooooh!
I told you I'd be cool
now I feel like a fool
I got sucked into your crazy
but it won't phase me
It's a total bore
I've heard it all before,
the cat got out, he came running back for more.
You told me you were done with her
and I believed every word
and now I wonder what I heard... ooooh!
You told me you were done with her
and I believed every word
and now I wonder what I heard... ooooh!
You told me you were done with her
and I believed every word
and now I wonder what I heard... ooooh!
You told me you were done with her
and I believed every word
and now I wonder what I heard... ooooh!
In love with love.
In love with a passionate heart.
In love with love.
In love even when we're apart.
I wondered the difference of how it could last.
I heard the celebration of champagne in glass.
No wonder, it's no wonder why I'm in love with love.
In love with a passionate heart.
In love with love.
In love with the form of the art.
We love through the fighting of everyday life, of glass that gets broken and cuts like a knife.
I wonder and I wonder why I'm in love with love.
In love with a passionate heart.
In love with love then on with the delicate march.
Heart of fire.
House of fire.
In love with love.
In love with a passionate heart.
In love with love.
On fire with a passionate heart.
Ablaze with reflection, our hot house is set blazing with a flaming with a fire.
It's so passionately racing with a chaser.
it's so hard to keep my wits about me!
Looking for your face where it could never be.
I'm following a trail that only I can see.
Raising waves of heat.
I press on in tiny bursts of speed.
Caught in my pursuit, I play the fetishist admission.
The longing that I feel drives me mad in no direction.
Nailed by something cute, I tear it out with microsurgical precision.
Incender.
Put some gas on the ember.
Lightning goes to ground.
Incender.
Crazy fool on a bender.
Striking the ground.
Burning me down.
Double take.
Left with an aftertaste.
I look again.
Was it your face?
Double take.
I'm in an altered state.
I look again.
Was it really you?
Another flash of face, igniting and familiar pulls me by the eye to the perimeter.
Riveting my gaze.
Is that your face in the crowd?
Incender.
Drop some gas on the ember.
I felt a slap on the face.
Incender.
Crazy fool on a bender.
Striking the ground, burning me down.
Double take.
Left with an aftertaste.
I look again.
Was it your face?
I fell awake.
I'm in an altered state.
I look again.
Was it really you?
Double take.
Left with an aftertaste.
I look again.
Was it your face?
Looking for your face where it could never be.
I'm following a trail that only I can see.
Double take.
I'm in an altered state.
I look again.
Was it really you?
I'm following a trail that only I can see.
I'm on E. I'm on E. I'm on E.
Got nothin' to say.
I used to have a car of my own
I'm on E. I'm on E. I'm on E for England.
Laid out for maybe a week
I've walked my feet to the bone
I'd give my life for a car of my own
I'm on E. I'm on E.
Two weeks ago Saturday I was on TV.
I'd like a show of my own
But you see I'm still on E even though everything is happening to me
So when you're drivin' on home
Don't regret your loan
I'm on E. I'm on E.
I gave my car to a guy named Vinnie.
I feel like gassin' my feet
They've totalled me and skipped a beat.
I used to have a car of my own
28 or 58. Walking to refrigerator
To the pump, do the bump
Still on E, I'll think of something
I'm on E and I'm on E
I'll never have to stop my feet
28 or 58
Walking to refrigerator
To the pump, do the bump
Still on E, I'll think of something
I'm on E and I'm on E
I'll never have to fill my feet up
First I was thinking that you're ok.
Then I was thinking you're far away.
Though how I might like to get to know you better.
I just got to got to get to know you mmm much much better!
I want you!
Made up my mind and I made my plans.
I'm onto you like a hardcore fan.
I got trackers and lookouts, electronic scanners.
Got you on my mind and it's mind over manners.
I've got the inside news.
I've got the latest point of view.
I'm looking to pursue any stories that I hear of you.
Packing my bag and I'm playing my hand.
He looks to me like the promised man.
Got no time for poses.
Set my explosives.
I'm gunning for you, I got power packed motives.
Daybreak comes alive when I'm with you, boy
Too late, can't survive without you in my world
Falling down like rain, I hear the thunder
I've thrown it all away to keep from going under
I gotta go back, back from the place that has no shame
I gotta go back to go where the past doesn't show
I'll take the blame, I can see clearly now
I can go all the way
I can see clearly now that you're near me
All left, gone away, open up your eyes
You've seen yesterday, now time to run and hide
(It comes as no surprise)
Country cousins stepping out on city sides
Want to warm you and wish you a lovely time
Dirty dozens gonna push their pistols, gonna pull their pride
Oh, so friendly flirties change their partners choose up sides
Buckle up your seat belt, baby
It's gonna be a bumpy ride
Buckle up your sweet self sugar
You drive me crazy, ya fly me high
Re re repercussions, echo and the reverbs sigh
Careless caution, it's not the case but what's inside
What can pass for safety measures?
You can tell 'em not to wreck your treasures
No this time, not ever, not next time
Make secure some sons and lovers
It's all made clear with see-through covers
We're too close, too close for comfort now
Buckle up that seat belt, baby
It's gonna be a bumpity bump
Buckle up your sweet self sugar
You drive me crazy and I jumpity jump
Yeah, you got to do it
Yeah there's nothing to it, it's the law
Pull over, coming up on some bad road
Uh, roy?
Yes deutch?
It's about my hats.
What about them? I mean, they bring something out in me. i...
I don't want that something, I want my hats back.
Why just... we're supposed to be friends... people who like each other want to see each other's lives enriched in some way...
You were seen last night in a restaurant havingdinnerwith one of my hats.
It's a small thing.
You know...
When I say you're a pork chop you best believe you're a pork chop.
P-o-r-k
C-h-o-p.
When a fella comes a callin' and you're waiting there til morning...
He's a pork chop.
Pork chop.
When he's whistlin his romances, and he's making other glances...
He's a pork chop.
Pork chop.
He's a running and a dancing while he paints the town a special blue.
Teaching roller skating to the missing farm, that's the way he do.
So I care about things.
He can play mysterioso and everybody knows so.
He's a pork chop.
Pork chop.
Gonna leave me at the altar reading comic books by faulkner.
He's a pork chop.
Pork chop.
He's dragging his ass round, promises he said he'd do
And I knew
He'd be ringin me this evening so suprised to hear me screaming "you're a pork chop!
Pork chop!"
I take issue.
You should try faulkner.
I should what!?
Try faulkner.
...soundsdirty.
Look. the thing is this: I am a doer.
Huh!
There are doers and there are don'ters.
Yes, yes...
I may not be there for you, but I am doing things.
Yes... uh huh...
That's a responsible person, a caring person, not what you say, a jambone de pork, whatever..
Wha... wait a second. just wait a second...
*muffled argument*
I try to tell my feelings, and he's looking at the ceiling.
He's a pork chop.
Pork chop.
On and on about abuses, and he's sitting being useless.
He's a pork chop.
(that's for sure!)
He's dragging his ass round, promises he said he'd do
And I knew
He'd be ringin me this evening so suprised to hear me screaming "you're a pork chop!
Pork chop!"
I am suprised! I don't know why...
*more obscured arguing to end*
When I was 17, I saw a magazine
It had those English boys, who had long hair
When I was on my own, they moved into my town
And I just called 'em up and they'd be there
In 1969, I had a lousy time
I listened to the songs, read letters sent from Nam
Now peace and love were gone, the tired soldiers home
Ideal society gunned down the seventies
Does it feel the same to you? Why do you act the way you do?
Pack it up or pack it in, there's no excuse
Could the hands of time reverse? Would we wake or take the ride
And again speak with one voice?
We knew each other well, although we never met
Messages passed to tell equal respect
Coincidence recurred, I had to laugh a lot
One week hung up superb, said maybe not
Does it feel the same to you? Why do you act the way you do?
Pack it up or pack it in, there's no excuse
Could the hands of time reverse? Would we wake or take the ride
And again speak with one voice?
Does it feel the same to you? Why do you act the way you do?
Pack it up or pack it in, there's no excuse
Call on me, oh call up, baby
Call on me, oh call
Call on me, oh call up, darling

I know where you're coming from

Cover of love's alibi
Call me!
(Call me!)
On the line
Call me, call me any anytime
Call me!

I'll arrive
When you're ready we can share the wine

Darkness falls like a black leather jacket and melts into the sidewalk like a sleeping drunk.
In the streets, the wind throws yesterday's headlines around.
Another night comes and goes.
So, for awhile back then there was someplace to go.
Somewhere more home than a house.
A family of choice, not an accident, but sometimes as soon as something gets started it's over.
Now the days are much shorter and the people from the good part of town all come around, but the something is missing even though there's more there now.
I shrug off my attempts to explain how a torn t-shirt made it all danger again.
I don't like flashbacks in movies.
I like the story to proceed.
I don't like talking about the old days except if it tells where the future will lead.
So we take a walk down this haunted hall or stumble through a shattered recall.
I know there's nothing to relive, it's just the shape of it all.
I don't want it different.
Don't want it again but value for value, now I'd never want it to end.
You think of the old friends and faces no more to be seen.
You think how much fun a line-up would mean.
And once that tape starts playing, it's too hard to make it rewind.
That one special face takes over your mind.
That end of the run.
We almost won.
The end of the run.
We had our fun.
The end of the run.
I knew it then.
It won't be back again.
We stood in the cold night, though we should be warm, in the back of the lot with me in your arms.
The sun was falling.
The grey rain was pouring.
The cars were all dirty and slow.
We both had our kiss and, out of the depths and darkness, with my eyes closed I still see you fine.
Cause that was the season we make our dreams come true.
There was no limit to what we could do.
The end of the run.
We almost won.
The end of the run.
We had our fun.
The end of the run.
I knew it then.
He won't be back again.
Once that tape starts playing it's too hard to make it rewind.
With my eyes closed I still see you fine.
That was the season we make our dreams come true.
There was no limit to what we could do.
The end of the run.
We almost won.
The end of the run.
We had our fun.
The end of the run.
I knew it then.
He won't be back again.

In a patent leather life
I was foolish, you were right
All night rookies pass the time
They're looking for somewhere to go
Shiny boots are up their thighs
Mother in the night
Calling you, calling you
Mother in the night
Where are you, where are you now?
Mother's left the building
We're the missing children
Mother in the night
Where are you, where are you tonight?
Mother, may I stay all night?
Lift your curfew like the light
Collars turned against the cold
I'm looking for someone to hold
In your patent leather night
Mother in the night
Calling you, calling you
Mother in the night
Where are you, where are you now?
Mother's left the building
We're the missing children
Mother in the night
Where are you, where are you?
Now that I can't remember
I need you more than ever
Why can't we be together always?
Mother in the night
Mother in the night
Mother's left the building
We're the missing children
Mother in the night
Where are you, where are you now?
Mother in the night
Calling you, calling you
Mother in the night
Where are you, where are you tonight?
All I get is rain.
Thunder clouds up above my head.
Storm warning's been posted.
Heavy weather predicted today.
There's a storm on outside.
I've been thinking about the day... it was in late september.
I thought that you would have changed my life but it's only rainy, rainy december.
I get caught in the, I get caught in the rain.
Rain rain go away, come again some other day.
Baby baby, unchain my heart!
Unchain my soul.
Let the sunshine back into my life.
Bring it on, let it roll.
Make the wind blow the clouds away, hey.
All I want is inspiration.
Let the voices within me speak.
But for now it's only rainy, rainy, rainy december.
I've had enough of this rain crying for my pain.
Let in some light again.
Make the day night again.
It's raining in my heart.
The sky is always dark.
The calm before the storm.
There was no time to warn.
Got to keep brewing on.
The water's coming in, into my heart before there was time to warn you.
I can't give up my reason, I love the change in season.
Maybe it's just a twist of light tonight, but the city's so bright, this whole town's in focus.
He'd always call me "baby strange."
He's hold my head and pray for rain.
Oh johnny, let me be your dog star girl.
Let me curl inside.
The fire's just right.
The fire's just right in focus.
But, then he said, "like, anything goes, baby."
But I don't know.
I just don't know.
Do you?
And how'd I ever get to this dead man's town where the rain, where the rain falls down, where the rain falls down forever?
And then he said, "so much for you, so much for me," but I don't see.
No, I don't see.
Do you?
And how'd I ever get to this dead man's town where the rain, where the rain falls down, where the rain falls down forever?
Forever.
Forever.
Forever.
Forever.
I'm just sitting here in my treetop
I'm just swing, swing, swinging away
Feel so magical, feel so lost
Will you catch me on my way down?
I drank your cherry cola
I let you win me over
You're nicer when you're sober
Please just tell me
What makes the world go 'round?
What makes the world go 'round?
What makes the world go 'round?
Is it love, oh
Is it love, oh-oh
Is it love, oh
Or is it gravity?
Is it love, oh
Is it love, oh-oh
Is it love, oh
Or is it gravity?
You chewed my heart and spat it out
Now you're run, run, running away
You didn't pick me off the floor
You didn't catch me on my way down
My pretty mouth is open
My words just keep on flowing
I'm nicer when I'm sober
Please just tell me
What makes the world go 'round
What makes the world go 'round
What makes the world go 'round?
Is it love, oh
Is it love, oh-oh
Is it love, oh
Or is it gravity?
Is it love, oh
Is it love, oh-oh
Is it love, oh
Or is it gravity?
Is it, is it gravity?
Or is it I Love You?
Is it gravity?
I've been sitting here in my treetop
For a long time now, I'm not coming down
You see, I've been sitting here in my treetop
I'm not coming down, I'm not coming down
You see, I've been sitting here in my treetop
For a long time now, I'm not coming down
You see, I've been sitting here, I've been sitting here, I've been sitting here
Is it love, oh
Is it love, oh-oh
Is it love, oh
Or is it gravity?
Is it love, oh
Is it love, oh-oh
Is it love, oh
Or is it gravity?
Is it gravity?
Is it gravity?
You look to me and you tell me things like a magazine.
And you fix on me with the secret eye like a submarine.
You camoflauge with your entourage.
You can disappear.
You look to me though I can tell where you've been and where you're going.
Ooh lalala la ah.
You can't look around, you can't look around, you know.
Why look up and down you can't look around you know know know know.
When you've been to half the world and when you go away,
When you've been to africa, when you've seen bombay,
You're looking down from a plane, looking down at your sector.
Take a look at the factories, they look just like transistors.
You can't look around, you can't look around, you know.
Don't look around you know.
Why look up and down?
You won't turn around and go go go go.
You don't look around, you can't look around, you know.
There's no one around to see that you're all alone.
Your perfect face in a perfect place.
Could this be a situation for me to see,
For me to see you standing like a statue?
And to the left and to the right lions waiting for the night.
Come down, don't explain, and don't you wonder.
Don't you wonder why.
Why.
Ooh, don't you wonder why.
Don't look.
Don't look no.
You can't look around, you can't look around, you know, you know.
Don't look around you know.
You can't look around, you can't look around.
You know.
You can't look around, you can't look around, you know.
Don't look around you know.
No no no.
Toe to toe, dancing very close
Barely breathing, almost comatose
Wall to wall, people hypnotized
And they're stepping lightly
Hang each night in rapture
Back to back, sacroiliac
Spineless movement and a wild attack
Face to face, sadly solitude
And it's finger popping
Twenty-four hour shopping in rapture
Fab Five Freddie told me everybody's fly
DJ's spinnin' are savin' my mind
Flash is fast, flash is cool
Francois sais pas, flashe' no do
And you don't stop, sure shot
Go out to the parking lot
And you get in your car and drive real far
And you drive all night and then you see a light
And it comes right down and lands on the ground
And out comes a man from Mars
And you try to run but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
And then you're in the man from Mars
You go out at night eatin' cars
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercurys and Subarus
And you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars
Then when there's no more cars
You go out at night and eat up bars
Where the people meet
Face to face, dance cheek to cheek
One to one, man to man
Dance toe to toe, don't move too slow
'Cause the man from Mars is through with cars
He's eatin' bars, yeah, wall to wall
Door to door, hall to hall
He's gonna eat 'em all
Rapture, be pure
Take a tour through the sewer
Don't strain your brain, paint a train
You'll be singin' in the rain
I said, "Don't stop, do punk rock"
Man to man, body muscular
Seismic decibel by the jugular
Wall to wall, tea time technology
And a digital ladder, no sign of bad luck in rapture
Well, now you see what you wanna be
Just have your party on TV
'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars
Where the TV's on
Now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race
And you hip-hop and you don't stop
Just blast off, sure shot
'Cause the man from Mars
Stopped eatin' cars and eatin' bars
And now he only eats guitars
Get up!
Some of my old friends say I'm self possessed
I hope you don't mind if I get something off my chest
Between you and me I only go out at night
Sunlight in my eyes just makes me uptight
In the backroom we be drinking all night
We be living in a vacuum
We be looking for a fight
In the backroom we be drinking all night
We be running out of headroom
We be looking for a fight
Crowd was thinning out
And he came through the door
I look right at him
He looks at the floor
Awkward glances catch the thread long ago
I'm seeing red
Does your sister dress you up
Does the devil know you're dead
I don't know if Gabriel keeps a place for me
I still want to go to heaven & see what I can see
I don't want to have St Peter close the gate on me
I still want to get to heaven & be what I can be
We had moved to the place
I heard them say 'Last Call'
I stepped over all of them
And walked on down the hall
The man says not to wait for judgment
It comes everyday
Absolution at a price
And we all have to pay
In the backroom we be drinking all night
We be living in a vacuum
We be looking for a fight
In the backroom we be drinking all night
We be running out of headroom
We be looking for a fight
I don't know if Gabriel keeps a place for me
I still want to go to heaven & see what I can see
I don't want to have St Peter close the gate on me
I still want to get to heaven & be what I can be
Shoo sha doo
Shoo sha doo
Shoo sha doo
Shoo sha doo
Shoo sha doo
Shoo sha doo
Shoo sha doo
Shoo
(We be drinking all night)
In the backroom we be drinking all night
We be living in a vacuum
We be looking for a fight
In the backroom we be drinking all night
We be running out of headroom
We be looking for a fight
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
I'm not the kind of girl who gives up just like that
Oh, no
It's not the things you do that tease and wound me bad
But it's the way you do the things you do to me
I'm not the kind of girl who gives up just like that
Oh, no
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one, number one
Every girl wants you to be her man
But I'll wait my dear 'til it's my turn
I'm not the kind of girl who gives up just like that
Oh, no
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one, number one
Every girl wants you to be her man
But I'll wait my dear 'til it's my turn
I'm not the kind of girl who gives up just like that
Oh, no
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one, number one, number one
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one...
Surrender my love to you? oh no. I won't surrender.
Surrender my love to you? oh no. I won't.
Before I surrender my love to you I'd rather lie down in the street and get hit by a big mack truck.
Surrender my love to you?
I'd rather sleep in a lion's den. maybe then I'll have better luck.
I get so mad thinking of the chance you had.
You had my love, but you didn't want it then.
So now before I give you my love I'll need a better excuse to take that abuse again.
Surrender my love to you? oh no. I won't surrender.
Surrender my love to you? oh no. I won't.
Before I surrender my love to you I'd rather jump into the sea and be eaten by a big fat shark.
Surrender my love to you?
Like a hunter you never miss your mark.
I think this time you are gonna find you want my love, you'll have to take it.
So now come on and shoot your best shot.
Come on, give me all you got.
Surrender my love to you? oh no. I won't surrender.
Surrender my love to you? oh no. I won't.
Maybe I'm lost
Watch while my mind starts to go
Maybe I dribble a little
Maybe I'm lost
I only put up a front
Losing the fear for the hunt
Address me as Madame Kluseau
People all tell me to go, to go, and jump off a bridge
Where's my house?
Maybe it's time to relax
Sell insurance and pack up your sax
Buy a chateau au sud de la Bronx
Maybe they're right
They say I should bolt
Take a train on the fifth of July
I'll pack some apples and eau de cologne
Hey, maybe I'll try, I'll try, I'll try and blow up a bridge
I'd be staring at tugboats in June
And what is the name of this tune
Turning tricks on the boat to Calais
I'd be Queen for a day then I'd settle for luck
Daily double at old Aqueduct
I'd fill my pockets with sheckles
And juice and put my winnings to use
And go and go and blow up a bridge
Where's my house? What's my name?
Where am I? Who are you?
Where's my house? What's my name?
Where am I? Who are you?
We took too long to park the car
Ran across the street into the bar
Your face said it was four O'clock
I closed my eyes and heard a shot
The traffic light were much too hot
I walked my eyes around the block
Purple shadows were so thin
I had close my eyes again
I didn't know they were important to you
I thought that faces were a poster
Natural things, scenery
You showed me your kind of madness
Soft sounds, slip out silently
Time passenger to future shock
I closed my eyes and saw you drop
I didn't know they were important to you
I thought that faces were a poster
Natural things, scenery
Ahhhhh

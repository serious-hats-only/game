This magic moment
So different and so new
Was like any other
Until I met you And then it happened
It took me by surprise
I knew that you felt it too
I could see it by the look in your eyes Sweeter than wine
Softer than a summer's night
Everything I want, I have
Whenever I hold you tight This magic moment
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever
Forever 'til the end of time So why won't you dance with me? Hey baby
Why won't you dance with me? This magic moment
So different and so new
Was like any other
Until I met you And then it happened
You know, it took me by surprise
I knew that you felt it too
By the look in your eyes Sweeter than wine
Ooh, softer than a summer's night
Everything I want, I have
Whenever I hold you tight
This magic moment
Sweeter than wine
Softer than a summer's night
So please, baby
So please, save the last dance for me This magic moment
So different and so new
Was like any other
Until I met you And then it happened
It took me by surprise
I knew that you felt it too
I could see it by the look in your eyes Sweeter than wine
Softer than a summer's night
Everything I want, I have
Whenever I hold you tight This magic moment
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever
Forever 'til the end of time So why won't you dance with me? Hey baby
Why won't you dance with me? This magic moment
So different and so new
Was like any other
Until I met you And then it happened
You know, it took me by surprise
I knew that you felt it too
By the look in your eyes Sweeter than wine
Ooh, softer than a summer's night
Everything I want, I have
Whenever I hold you tight
This magic moment
Sweeter than wine
Softer than a summer's night
So please, baby
So please, save the last dance for me Iced Honey Lyrics You can't put a butterfly in a jar
If the effort's too high no matter who you are
You can't catch the moon, or the sun or the stars
It doesn't matter who you are
Iced honey Now me I've tried a million tricks
To make life cold and make it stick
Not running heat that flames then out
But the proud piece of ice that always floats
Iced honey If I can't trap a butterfly or a bee
If I can't keep my heart where I want it to be
If no matter how much soul and heart
I put to the wood
If a flaming heart is not that good
Iced honey If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
If violence mars your final hour
If you make others feel like jam
Poured on a piece of charbroiled lamb If it's all mixed up and you cannot shout
And your oxygen starts to run out
If your final gasp has the recipe wrong
And instead of hello you say so long If your energy starts to leak out
And people wonder what you're all about
A heartbreaker with an unattached heart
The story of love gives them all a start And me, I've always been this way
Not by choice, just this way
I can't put my honey pot in a jar
Or a heart or a fist of some young boy If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
No wonder no need to wonder where you are
It might seem like hell, the River Styx
Your affection never sticks No matter what you say, no matter what you do
A butterfly heart flies right past you
There's nothing to say, nothing to do
See if the ice will melt for you
Iced honey I really care a lot although I look like I do not
Since I was shot there's nobody but you
I know I look blase, party andy's what the papers say
At dinner I'm the one who pays - for a nobody like you
Nobody but you, a nobody like you
Since I got shot there's nobody but you Won't you decorate my house
I'll sit there quiet as a mouse
You know me I like to look a lot - at nobody like you
I'll hold your hand and slap my face
I'll tickle you to your disgrace
Won't you put me in my proper place - a nobody like you Sundays I pray a lot, I'd like to wind you up
And paint your clock
I want to be what I am not - for a nobody like you The bullet split my spleen and lung, the doctors said I was gone
Inside I've got some shattered bone for nobody but you I'm still not sure I didn't die
And if I'm dreaming I still have bad pains inside
I know I'll never be a bride - to nobody like you I wish I had a stronger chin, my skin was good, my nose was thin
This is no movie I'd ask to be in - with a nobody like you
Nobody like you, a nobody like you, all my life -
It's been nobodies like you I think images are worth repeating
Images repeated from a painting
Images taken from a painting
From a photo worth re-seeing
I love images worth repeating
Project them upon the ceiling
Multiply them with silk screening
See them with a different feeling
Images, those images
Images, those images
Some say images have no feeling
I think there's a deeper meaning
Mechanical precision or so it's seeming
Instigates a cooler feeling
I love multiplicity of screenings
Things born anew display new meanings
I think images are worth repeating
And repeating and repeating
Images, those images
Images
I'm no urban idiot savant
Spewing paint without any order
I'm no sphinx, no mystery enigma
What I paint is very ordinary
I don't think I'm old or modern
I don't think, I think I'm thinking
It doesn't matter what I'm thinking
It's the images that are worth repeating
And repeating those images
Images
If you're looking for a deeper meaning
I'm as deep as this high ceiling
If you think technique is meaning
You might find me very simple
You might think the images are boring
Cars and cans and chairs and flowers
You might find me personally boring
Hammer, sickle, Mao Tse Tong, Mao Tse Tong
Those images
Those images, images
I think that it bears repeating the images upon the ceiling
I love images worth repeating and repeating and repeating
Images, images
Those images, those images Please
Come over to 81st street I'm in the apartment above the bar
You know you can't miss it, it's across from the subway
And the tacky store with the mylar scarves My skin's as pale as outdoors moon
My hair's silver like a tiffany watch
I like lots of people around me but don't kiss hello
And please don't touch It's a czechoslovakian custom my mother passed on to me
The way to make friends andy is invite them up for tea
Open house, open house I've got a lot of cats, here's my favorite
She's lady called sam
I made a paper doll of her - you can have it That's what I did when I had st.vitus dance
It's a Czechoslovakian custom my mother pased on to me
Give people little presents so they remember me
Open house, open house Someone bring the vegetables, someone please bring heat
My mother showed up yesterday, we need something to eat
I think I got a job today they want me to draw shoes
The ones I drew were old and used
They told me - draw something new
Open house, open house Fly me to the moon, fly me to a star
But there are no stars in the new york sky
They're all on the ground
You scared yourself with music, I scared myself with paint
It almost made me faint
Open house, open house When I see the way you paint your lips
and I smell your perfume
when I see the brand new color
that you've dyed your hair, too
I know, you know, it's more than physical
My love, my love, my love, love is chemical Well I know the saying goes
that all in love and war is fair
but I've never stood a chance
against your chemical warfare
The polish on your fingernails
mascara on your eyes
the lotion you rub on at night
to make sure your hands ain't dry
My love, my love, my love, love is chemical (My, my, my love is chemical)
(my, my, my love is chemical)
I know, I know, it's more than physical, hey baby
My love, my love, my love, love is chemical Well I hope that you won't take offense
it's not that you're not pretty
it's only that I feel like
I'm in love with test tube city
I know with you, I'm on the pinnacle
I'm on the pinnacle, babe
My love, my love, my love, love is chemical
we're not just talking physical desire here (My, my, my love is chemical)
(my, my, my love is chemical)
I know with you, it's more than physical
much more than just carnal lust
My love, my love, my love, love is chemical My, my love, oh, love is chemical
my, my, my love is chemical
It's so much more than physical, honey
it's much more than physical
My love, my love, my love, love is chemical My, my, my, my love is chemical
hey baby, my, my, my, my love is chemical
So much more than physical, honey, why don't you come here
my love is chemical
I'd like to communicate with you directly
my love is chemical So much more than physical Andy was a catholic, the ethic ran through his bones
He lived alone with his mother, collecting gossip and toys
Every sunday when he went to church
He'd kneel in his pew and say, "it's just work,
All that matters is work." He was a lot of things, what I remember most
He'd say, "I've got to bring home the bacon,
someone's got to bring home the roast."
He'd get to the factory early
If you'd ask him he'd tell you straight out
It's just work, the most important thing is work
No matter what I did it never seemed enough
He said I was lazy, I said I was young
He said, "how many songs did you write?"
I'd written zero, I'd lied and said, "ten."
"You won't be young forever
You should have written fifteen."
It's work, the most important thing is work
It's work, the most important thing is work "you ought to make things big
People like it that way
And the songs with the dirty words - record them that way"
Andy liked to stir up trouble, he was funny that way
He said, "it's just work, all that matters is work"
Andy sat down to talk one day
He said decide what you want
Do you want to expand your parameters
Or play museums like some dilettante
I fired him on the spot, he got red and called me a rat
It was the worst word that he could think of
And I've never seen him like that
It's just work, I thought he said it's just work
Work, he said it's just work Andy said a lot of things, I stored them all away in my head
Sometimes when I can't decide what I should do
I think what would andy have said
He'd probably say you think too much
That's 'cause there's work that you don't want to do
It's work, the most important thing is work
Work, the most important thing is work Jenny said, when she was just five years old
There was nothin' happening at all
Every time she puts on the radio
There was nothin' goin' down at all, not at all
Then, one fine mornin', she puts on a New York station
You know, she couldn't believe what she heard at all
She started shakin' to that fine, fine music
You know, her life was saved by rock'n'roll Despite all the imputations
You know, you could just go out
And dance to a rock'n'roll station
And it was all right, hey baby,
You know, it was all right Jenny said, when she was just about five years old
'You know, my parents are gonna be the death of us all
Two TV sets and two Cadillac cars
Well, you know, ain't gonna help me at all Then, one fine morning, she turns on a New York station
She doesn't believe what she hears at all
Ooh, she started dancin' to that fine, fine music
You know, her life was saved by rock'n'roll
Yeah, rock'n'roll Despite all the computations
You could just dance to that rock'n'roll station
And baby, it was all right, yeah
Hey, it was all right
Hey, here she comes now Jenny said, when she was just about five years old
'Hey, you know, there's nothin' happening at all, not at all
Every time I put on the radio
You know, there's nothin' goin' down at all, not at all
But, one fine morning, she hears a New York station
She couldn't believe what she heard at all, hey, not at all
She started dancing to that fine, fine music
You know, her life was saved by rock'n'roll
Yes, rock'n'roll Despite all the computations
You know, you could just dance to the rock'n'roll station All right
All right, all right, and it was all right
Oh, listen to me now, it was all right
Come on now, believe me, it was all right
it was all right
hey, it's all right now I remember you
I remember me
I remember
I remember how things used to be
I remember every word that you said
I remember, how could I forget
I remember, I remember you
(I remember, I remember) I remember you
I remember your old address
And I remember
How could I forget
I remember thinking how my luck changed
I remember being so amazed
I remember, I remember you
(I remember, I remember)
I remember, I remember you
(I remember, I remember) I remember you
I remember me
I remember
The way things used to be

... I wish I was the warrior king
In every language that I speak
Lord over all that I survey
And all that I see I keep
Power omnipresent
Undiminished uncontrolled
With a message violent fury
At the center of my soul I wish I was a warrior king
Inscrutable benign
With a faceless charging power
Always at my command
Footsteps so heavy that the world shakes
My rage instilling fear, ah, ha
Yet cautious firm but fair and good
The perfect warrior king I wish I installed angles
In every subject's house
Agents of my goodness
No one would be without
A steak on every plate
A car for every house
And if you ever crossed me
I'd have your eyes put out You don't exist without me
Without me you don't exist
And if logic won't convinced you
Then there's always this
I'm bigger, smarter, stronger, tough
Yet sensitive and kind
And though I could crush you like a bug
It will never cross my mind It wouldn't cross my mind to your neck
Or rip out your vicious tongue
It wouldn't cross my mind to snap your leg like a twig
Or squash you like some slug
You are a violent messenger
And I'm not above your taunts
And if you hit me you know I'll kill you
Because I'm the warrior king You've got the money, I've got the time
You want your freedom, make your freedom mine
'Cause I've got the style it takes
And money is all that it takes You've got connections and I've got the art
You like attention and I like your looks
And I have the style it takes
And you know the people it takes Why don't you sit right over there
We'll do a movie portrait
I'll turn the camera on and I won't even be there
A portrait that moves, you look great I think I'll put the Empire State Building on your wall
For 24 hours glowing on your wall
Watch the sun rise above it in your room
Wallpaper art, a great view I've got a Brillo box and I say it's art
It's the same one you can buy at any supermarket
'Cause I've got the style it takes
And you've got the people it takes This is a rock group called The Velvet Underground
I show movies on them, do you like their sound
'Cause they have a style that grates
And I have art to make Let's do a movie here next week
We don't have sound
But you're so great
You don't have to speak You've got the style it takes, kiss
You've got the style it takes, eat
You've got the style it takes, couch
You've got the style it takes, kiss Stupid man, hitch-hiking out of a good life

Stupid man Hey, some kinds of love
Margarita told tom
Between thought and expression
Lies a lifetime
Situations arise
Because of the weather
And no kinds of love
Are better than others
La-dee-ta-ta-ta Hey, some kinds of love
Now margarita told tom
Well of course, baby, you're a bore
But at that you're not charmless
Because a bore is a straight line
Finds a wealth in division
And no kinds of love
Mistaken for vision
La-dee-ta Some kinds of love
Now margarita told tom
They turn to division
Woh baby, you're not charming
Oh baby, .... And no kinds of love
Mistaken for vision
Put jelly on your shoulder
Oh baby, lies down upon the carpet
Put jelly on your shoulder
Let's do what you fear most
That from which you recoil
But still makes your eyes moist
Put jelly, baby, on your shoulder
Lies down, now baby, on the carpet, ooohhh
Ooohhh-ooohhh, ooohhh
Ooohhh-ooohhh-ooohhh, ooohhh-ooohhh Well some kinds of love
They're mistaken for vision Well I don't know, baby, what it's all about
Oh little baby, why don't you come back
Hey, la-dee-ta-ta-ta
Oh no lord, ta-li-ta-li-sha
Oh now baby, la-dee-ta-ta
Oh baby, la-dee-ta, ta-ti-ta-ti-ta
Da-ti-da-ti-ta, la-ta-ta When you're growing up in a small town
When you're growing up in a small town
When you're growing up in a small town
You say no one famous ever came from here
When you're growing up in a small town
And you're having a nervous breakdown
And you think that you'll never escape it
Yourself or the place that you live
Where did picasso come from
There's no michelangelo coming from pittsburgh
If art is the tip of the iceberg
I'm the part sinking below When you're growing up in a small town
Bad skin, bad eyes - gay and fatty
People look at you funny
When you're in a small town
My father worked in construction
It's not something for which I'm suited Oh - what is something for which you are suited?
Getting out of here I hate being odd in a small town
If they stare let them stare in new york city
As this pink eyed painting albino
How far can my fantasy go?
I'm no dali coming from pittsburgh
No adorable lisping capote
My hero - oh do you think I could meet him?
I'd camp out at his front door
There is only one good thing about small town
There is only one good use for a small town
There is only one good thing about small town
You know that you want to get out When you're growing up in a small town
You know you'll grow down in a small town
There is only one good use for a small town
You hate it and you'll know you have to leave It was a very cold clear fall night
I had a terrible dream
Billy name and brigid were playing under my stair case on the second floor about two o'clock in the morning I woke up because amos and archie had started barking
That made me very angry because I wasn't feeling well and I told them I was very cross the real me that they just better remember what happened to sam the bad cat that was left at home and got s
Nd went pussy heaven It was a very cold clear fall night
Some snowflakes were falling
Gee, it was so beautiful
And so I went to get my camera to take some pictures
And then I was taking the pictures
But the exposure thing wasn't right
And I was going to call fred or gerry
To find out how to get set it
I was too late
And then I remembered they were still probably at dinner
And anyway
I felt really bad and didn't want to talk to anybody
But the snowflakes were so beautiful and real looking
And I really wanted to hold them
And that's when I heard the voices
From down the hall near the stairs
So I got a flashlight
And I was scared and I went out into the hallway
There's been all kinds of troubles
Lately in the neighborhood
And someone's got to bring home the bacon and anyway
There were brigid and billy playing And under the stair case
Was a little meadow sort of like the park at 23rd street
Where all the young kids go and play frisbee
Gee, that must be fun
Maybe we should do an article on that in the magazine
But they'll just tell me I'm stupid and it won't sell
But I'll just hold my ground this time, I mean
It's my magazine, isn't it? So I was thinking that as the snowflakes fell
And I heard those voices having so much fun
Gee, it would be so great to have some fun
So I called billy
But either he didn't hear me or he didn't want to answer
Which was so strange
Because
Even if I don't like reunions I've always loved billy
I'm so glad he's working
I mean it's different than ondine
He keeps touring with those movies
And he doesn't even pay us and the film
I mean the film's just going to disintegrate and then what
I mean he's so normal off of drugs
I just don't get it And then I saw john cale
He's been looking really great
He's been coming by the office to exercise with me
Ronnie said I have a muscle
But he's been really mean since he went to aa
I mean what does it mean
When you give up drinking and then you're still so mean
He says I'm being lazy but I'm not
I'm just can't find any ideas
I mean I'm just not Let's face it
Going to get any ideas up at the office And seeing john made me think of the velvets
And I had been thinking about them
When I was on st. marks place
Going to that new gallery those sweet new kids have opened
But the thought I was old
And then I saw the old dom
The old club where we did our first shows
It was so great
And I don't understand about that velvet's first album
I mean I did the cover
I was the producer
And I always see it repackaged
And I've never gotten a penny from it
How could that be
I should call henry
But it was good seeing john
I did a cover for him
But I did in black and white and he change it to color
It would have been worth more if he'd left it my way
But you can never tell any body anything I've leaned that I tried calling again to billy and john
They wouldn't recognize me it was like I wasn't there
Why won't they let me in And then I saw lou
I'm so mad at him
Lou reed got married and didn't invite me
I mean is it because he thought I'd bring too many people
I don't get it
Could have at least called
I mean he's doing so great
Why doesn't he call me?
I saw him at the mtv show
And he was one row away and he didn't even say hello
I don't get it
You know I hate lou
I really do
He won't even hire us for his videos
And I was proud of him I was so scared today
There was blood leaking thought my shirt
From those old scars from being shot
And the corset I wear to keep my insides in was hurting
And I did three sets of fifteen pushups
And four sets of ten setups
But then my insides hurt
And I saw drops of blood on my shirt and I remember
The doctors saying I was dead
And then later they had to take blood out of my hand
'couse they ran out or veins
But then
All this thinking was making me an old grouch
And you can't do anything anyway so
If they wouldn't let me play with them in my own dream
I was just going to have to make another
And another
And another
Gee, wouldn't it be funny if I died in this dream
Before I could make another one up And nobody called And nobody came

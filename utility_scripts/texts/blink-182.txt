Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk...
I didn't mean to call you that
I can't remember what was said
Or what you threw at me Please tell me
Please tell me why
My car is in the front yard
And I am sleeping with my cloths on
I came in throught the window... Last night
And your... Gone
Gone It's no suprise to me I am my own worst enemy
Cuz every now and then I kick the living shit out of me
The smoke alarm is going offf and there a cigarette
Still buring Please tell me why
My car is in the front yard
And I'm sleeping with my clothes on
I came in throught the windo last night
And your gone
Gone Please tell me why
My car is in the front yard
And I am sleeping with my clothes on
I came inthrough the windo last night It's no suprise to me
I am my own worst enemy
Cuz every now and then I kick the livin' shit out of me Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk
I didn't mean to call you that I, I can't get you more pregnant
but if you're worried,
all I can take care of myself,
I can take care of myself. Remember the days
We would drink on the train
On our way to the show, Chicago
Naked Raygun live at the Cabaret Metro
Ten bucks to get into a fight you can't win
Boots and braces, yellow laces
Oxblood traces of the night before We are forgotten young suburbia
Loose on the streets of California
Underneath fluorescent lights
We'll waste the best nights of our life
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot
(Na, na na, na na, na na
Na, na na, na na, na na)
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot I can't wait 'til I'm off of work
I'll meet my friends at the Target curb
I rolled my ankle, Matt just broke his wrist
I climbed through your window at 3am
We listened to The Smiths and The Violent Femmes
Yeah, we both sang, "Why can't I get one kiss?" We are forgotten young suburbia
Loose on the streets of California
Underneath fluorescent lights
We'll waste the best nights of our life
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot We are the broken
No end in sight
We're the forgotten soldiers you left behind
There's no use trying
We lost the war
Now the dead and dying
Are back to even the score We are forgotten young suburbia
Loose on the streets of California
Underneath fluorescent lights
We'll waste the best nights of our life
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot
Na, na na, na na, na na
Na, na na, na na, na na
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot I'm a wreck, I'm out of time
I barely made it out alive
I'm not bent, I'm not cracked
I'm just broken
I watched the fire burn the sea
I wrapped my car around a tree
Hold me up, underneath
This heavy burden There's a halo in the distance
Salvation's barely out of reach Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone Tied up to a heart of stone
I screamed into a microphone
I burned the bridge, so I won't find my way home (find my way home) Lay with me, I can't sleep
Misery loves company
When I'm bent, when I'm cracked
When I'm broken There's a halo in the distance
Salvation's barely out of reach (out of reach) Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone Fifteen times a night, when the sun's gone down
In the dark awake and you're not around
And the closest thought is the edge of oblivion
Fifteen times a day when you check your phone
And I won't be there and you're all alone
'Cause we always lived on the edge of oblivion
Left to find our way through a Hitchcock film
In an empty bed with an hour to kill
'Cause it's only fun on the edge of oblivion (oblivion) Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone Hello there, the angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
We'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends
(I miss you, miss you)
(I miss you, miss you)
Where are you and I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick strange darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
And as I stared I counted
Webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight
Stop this pain tonight
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)
(I miss you, miss you)
(I miss you, miss you)
(I miss you, miss you)
(I miss you, miss you) (I miss you miss you) Hello there the angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends (I miss you I miss you)
(I miss you I miss you) Where are you and I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick strange darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
And as I stared I counted
The Webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop the pain tonight
Stop this pain tonight Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you) Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you) I miss you (miss you miss you)
(I miss you miss you) I took her out, it was a Friday night
I wore cologne to get the feeling right
We started making out and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty three
And I'm still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is A.D.D.?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again, what's my age again? Then later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a pay phone
I said I was the cops
And your husband's in jail
The state looks down on sodomy And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty three
And I'm still more amused by prank phone calls
What the hell is call ID?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again, what's my age again? And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty three
And you still act like you're in freshman year
What the hell is wrong with me?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again, what's my age again? That's about the time she broke up with me
No one should take themselves so seriously
With many years ahead to fall in line
Why would you wish that on me?
I never want to act my age
What's my age again, what's my age again? What's my age again? All the small things
True care truth brings
I'll take one lift
Your ride best trip
Always I know
You'll be at my show
Watching, waiting, commiserating Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na Late night, come home
Work sucks, I know
She left me roses by the stairs
Surprises let me know she cares Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
The night will go on, my little windmill Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
The night will go on
The night will go on
My little windmill Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cock-sucker,
Mother-fucker, tits, fart, turd, and twat. Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cock-sucker,
Mother-fucker, tits, fart, turd, and twat. Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cock-sucker,
Mother-fucker, tits, fart, turd, and twat. Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cock-sucker,
Mother-fucker, tits, fart, turd, and twat. I fucked your mom
I wunna suck my dad, and my mom too, oh is this thing on? (I miss you miss you) Hello there the angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
(The last train home)
(I'll take the last train home)
The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
(The last train home)

Just a small town girl
Livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train
Goin' anywhere
Just a city boy
Born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train
Goin' anywhere A singer in a smokey room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching
In the night
Streetlight people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time
Some will win
Some will lose
Some were born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching
In the night
Streetlight people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night [Instrumental interlude] Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlight people
Don't stop believin'
Hold on
Streetlight people
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlight people When the lights go down in the city
And the sun shines on the bay
Do I want to be there in my city?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh So you said, you're lonely
Well my friend I'm lonely too
I want to get back to my city by the rain
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh It's sad ohh, there's been mornings
Out of the world without you
Without your charm
Oh, oh, oh, nah, nah, nah, oh, oh When the lights go down in the city
And the sun shines on the bay
Do I want to be there in my city, oh oh?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh When the lights go down in the city
And the sun shines on the bay
Do I want to be there in my city
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Mmm, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Just a small town girl
Livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train
Goin' anywhere
Just a city boy
Born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train
Goin' anywhere A singer in a smokey room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching
In the night

Do I want to be there in my city
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Mmm, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Try and keep it simple
Not too far away
Movin' slow, so simple
Never felt this way Movin' sweet, so simple
Takin' time to say
The way to being, to being simple
Never felt this way Don't be lonely, oh my friends forget the past
Sweet as sugar, when you're movin'
When you're movin' slow at last
It's what I like to do How could it be so simple?
To forget the way
A way to being, to being simple
Never felt this way Oh don't be lonely
No, no, no, forget the past
Sweet as sugar when you're movin' slow
Your movin' slow at last It's what I like to do yes
It's what I like to do
It's what I like to do
It's what I like to do
(Don't be lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely) It's what I like to do
(Sweet as sugar, sugar, sugar)
It's what I like to do
It's what I like to do
(Movin' slow, movin' slow at last) It's what I like to do
It's what I like to do
(Don't be lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely)
It's what I like to do
It's what I like to do
(Oh sweet as sugar, sugar sugar) Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
She loves to laugh
She loves to sing
She does everything
She loves to move
She loves to grove
She loves the lovin' things
Ooh, all night, all night
Oh, every night
So hold tight, hold tight
Ooh, baby, hold tight
Oh, she said, Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
She said, Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it I was alone
I never knew
What good love could do
Ooh, then we touched
Then we sang
About the lovin' things Ooh, all night, all night
Oh, every night
So hold tight, hold tight
Ooh baby, hold tight
Oh, she said, Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
She said, Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it Do you feel me?
Do you feel me?
Do you feel me? Do you see the faces
'Round and 'round the places?
Are they people that you want to know? Do you see the faces
Runnin' 'round to different places?
Are they people that you want to know? Yes, I see their faces one by one
Yes, I see their joy and sadness
Every single face there lies a trace
Of sadness felt before Do you feel me?
Do you feel me? Do you see the faces
Runnin' 'round to different places?
Are you people that we want to know? We're the people
Goin' 'round and 'round to difference places
You're the people that we want to know Yes, you are the ones
You are the ones
Every word I say
I say, "True, yeah, true"
Every single face there lies a trace
Of sadness felt before Take a ride on a rocket
Take your mind, unlock it
You all know we can do it
If you put your mind to it Take your life as you feel it
Let no one deceive it
You all know we can do it
If you put you're mind to it Yes, I've seen
Yes, I've seen these lonely lonely places
Are we people that you want to know? Smilin' faces with long lasting traces
You're the people that we want to know
You're the people that we want to know
You're the people that we want to know So, take a ride on a rocket
Take your mind, unlock it
You all know we can do it
If you put your mind to it Take your life as you feel it
Let no one deceive it
You all know we can do it
If we put our minds to it This song is an instrumental.

[Pre-Chorus: Jacquees]
You got everything you want
You got everything you need
Yes I remember the times
When you caught me in lies
You knew other women wouldn't mind
So you stuck by my side
So everything [Chorus: Jacquees]
Everything you want and need
I'll comfort you, give you all of me
Cause everything you want and need
I'll be, I'll be [Post-Chorus: Jacquees]
It'll be you and me
For eternity
I give you my love everyday
I'ma be yours either way [Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
You and your niece, me and Jacquees
We can make love in between them sheets
All you can eat on me, it's a feast
Have fun wit' me while I run these streets
So sweet, so rough, so tough, so bad
Get whatchu want, throw it in the bag
Stayed down wit' me even when I did wrong
That's probably why I'm singin' this song
A boss hitta, a boss lady, that's you
Put your face on my right arm, tattoo
Met you, gotchu, get you, you're my angel, god bless you
Who am I in love with? Just you, float on the boat, just us two
Smokin' and strokin', just us two, this is splendid, flex it and bend it
Lay it out for ya, now let me play it out for ya
You get what she won't 'cause she don't compare
You get what you want 'cause you have been there for me
Carefully, prepared to lay down your life for me
My life would be nothin' wit' ouchu
And I ain't doin' nothin' wit' ouchu [Pre-Chorus: Jacquees]
You got everything you want
You got everything you need
Yes I remember the times
When you caught me in lies
You knew other women wouldn't mind
So you stuck by my side
So everything [Chorus: Jacquees]
Everything you want and need
I'll comfort you, give you all of me
'Cause everything you want and need
I'll be, I'll be [Post-Chorus: Jacquees]
It'll be you and me (that's all it will be)
For eternity (yeah)
I give you my love everyday
I'ma be yours either way (either way) [Verse 2: Dreezy]
He was gettin' money outta town (O.T.)
I was in the city 'bout mine (you know how I do)
And I knew he was a dog, had to put him on pause
But it happened at the right time (it worked out)
And I know you got drip, fast whips and the mansions
But you really need a girl who understands you (for real)
Like when you cash out, know I can too
Yeah I run through the money, I ain't ran through
And I keep it a hunnid
Good head, down bitch, let him get in my stomach (uh-huh)
First lady, still married to money
It was like a blind date 'cause I ain't see it comin'
Damn, I was on deep, he was still playin'
We was both young till I turned him into a man
Bitches do it for the 'Gram but this really who I am
If you get up in a jam, I'ma come through with the bands
Yeah, my type, no stereo (my nigga)
I love you like that woman that carried you
Back and forth, no merry-go, die for you like [?]
I ain't speakin' it up, just givin' you a scenario (just playin')
Yeah, I'm goin' to war if it's 'bout you (all day)
It ain't for me then it's not true (no it ain't)
I wanna be the last one you gotta lie to
I got everything I need if I gotchu [Pre-Chorus: Jacquees]
You got everything you want
You got everything you need
Yes I remember the times
When you caught me in lies
You knew other women wouldn't mind
So you stuck by my side
So everything [Chorus: Jacquees]
Everything you want and need (everything)
I'll comfort you, give you all of me (all of me)
Cause everything you want and need
I'll be, I'll be [Post-Chorus: Jacquees]
It'll be you and me
For eternity
I give you my love everyday
I'ma be yours either way [Intro]
Hey Snoop Dogg, can you give us a bedtime story?
Alright, hand me my backwoods, here we go [Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Just another day in my old neighborhood
Not bad meanin' bad but bad meanin' good
Time flies by with the boomin' system
Shot by my head, I popped back and I missed 'em
So I kept shootin' 'til I ran outta shots
Then I threw my gun at him and I ran up the block
Swang them hoes, bang them hoes
20 minutes later, I changed them clothes
For a disguise, east side niggas is back
Ain't heard your new shit 'cause you niggas is whack
I came to this party all by myself
But I won't leave by myself
I got his, hers and your bitch too
They all come through, it's sorta like a rendez-vous
I'm so true to this shit, never new to this shit
Kick back and watch your big homie do this shit [Chorus: Kokane]
Niggas weren't made to break me
'Cause all I just do is shine

Watch a nigga back one and dip it through with ease
7 little, 8 little, 9 little hoes
Wanna kick it, I suppose, gettin' tickets to my shows
10 to 11 but a dozen on the rose
Gave that bitch to my cousin 'cause he hard on the nose
Hey, you know how shit goes, make that bitch strike a pose
Triple O to the N so you know that bitch chose
So cold, make a nigga freeze, hoes down, nigga, Gs up [Chorus: Kokane]
Niggas weren't made to break me
'Cause all I just do is shine

Niggas gonna get real lenny

But lookin' back at it, young loc, Cuz, I'm on some other shit
Intellectual, misdirectional
Correct yourself so you can avoid correctional facilities
Mental stability, validity
Everythin' you look at ain't what it appear to be
Compellin' you, sellin' you, I'm tellin' you this
See poppin' this shit is like knockin' a bitch
I'm cold with it, rock roll with it, trick hoes with it
Nick Foles with it, get it, I be the backup, second in line
See when I get in, you ain't gettin' no more time
I'm free as a bird, C is the word, nigga, I did that, nigga
Never switchin' up, my nigga, let's get this shit back
True to this shit, never new to this shit
Kick back and watch your big homie do this shit [Chorus: Kokane]
Niggas weren't made to break me

With a fat dick
(Nate Dogg)
When I met you last night, baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for you lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give you a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over
And I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck that day baby
Just lay back and open your mouth Cause I have never met a girl That I love in the whole wide world
(Kurupt)
Well if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfucking indo to smoke
I gets loc'ed and loony
Bitch you can't do me
Do we look like BBD, you hoochie groupie
I have no love for hoes
That's something that I learned in tha Pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this ho just to lay this ho
I know the pussy's mine
So I'mma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it
There's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me And y'all know that bitches ain't shit to me I gives a fuck Why don't y'all pay attention
Approach her with a different proposition
I'm Kurupt ho
You'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
(Snoop Dogg)
Guess who back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
What you gon do
You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that ho
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch Knowing damn well I'm too caught up with my grip Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see it ain't no fun
If my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em
(Warren G)
Hey now you know
Inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, '64 -- red to be exact
With bitches on my side and bitches on my back
So back up, bitch, because I'm struggling
Just get on your knees and then start juggling
These motherfucking nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none 1, 2, 3 and to the 4
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door
Ready to make an entrance so back on up
(Cause you know we're about to rip shit up)
Give me the microphone first so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble
Ain't nothing but a G thang, baby
Two loc'ed out niggas so we're crazy
Death Row is the label that pays me
Unfadeable so please don't try to fade this (Hell yeah)
But um, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected, so I'mma let 'em understand
From a young G's perspective
And before me dig out a bitch I have to find a contraceptive
You never know, she could be earning her man
And learning her man (and at the same time burning her man)
Now you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it (Yeah)
And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield
And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
Well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff 
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
Dre, creep to the mic like a phantom 
Well I'm peeping and I'm creeping and I'm creep-in
But I damn near got caught, cause my beeper kept beeping
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax and strap on your seat belt
You never been on a ride like this before
With a producer who can rap and control the maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit
To add to my collection, the selection
Symbolizes dope, take a toke but don't choke
If you do, you'll have no clue
On what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do [Hook 2: Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg]
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and who gives a fuck about those
So just chill till the next episode You've got the feeling
To rock the other side
You've got the feeling
(Yeah, yeah) 
Falling back on that ass, with a hellafied gangsta lean
Getting funky on the mic like a old batch of collard greens
It's the capital S, oh yes I'm fresh, N double-O P
D O double G Y, D O double G, ya see
Showing much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimping hoes and clocking a grip like my name was Dolomite
Yeah, and it don't quit
I think they in the mood for some mothafuckin' G shit
(Hell yeah) so Dre (What's up Dogg?)
Gotta give them what they want (What's that, G?)
We gotta break 'em off something (Hell yeah)
And it's gotta be bumping, (City of Compton) 
Is where it takes place so, when asked, your attention
Mobbing like a motherfucker but I ain't lynching
Dropping the funky shit that's making the sucker niggas mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie: they all crumble
Try to get close, and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, cause if I slip then I'm slipping
But if I got my Nina then you know I'm straight tripping
And I'mma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if you bitches talk shit, I'll have to put the smack down
Yeah and you don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N and the city they call Long Beach
Putting the shit together
Like my nigga D.O.C., no one can do it better 
Like this, that and this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and who gives a fuck about those?

I was all in the club havin' a drink, blowin' on a sweet
When I peeped this little freak out I was all on the bar when drifter shawty redd came on
Then she hit the floor, now
With a see through dress, long hair, light brown eyes
Lookin' like Miss Bo Peep And a playa know if I take her home
With them real thick hips, you so right I'm gon' beat
So I approached the chick with the real pretty face
Nice curves on her with a lil? bitty waist I whispered in her ear, "Lil momma, what you drank?
I know that you're a freak
But you know I ain? t gon say shh"
See my game is outrageous
I got into the crib and exchanged some love faces
But it wasn't no need for me to rush to bust one
Cus I wanted her to have an eruption
Sensual seduction
Sensual seduction
Sensual seduction
Sensual seduction
Sensual seduction
(All the time, any time)
Sensual seduction
Sensual seduction Some of 'em lie about the shit they got
And what they do on the block
Some of 'em lie about the girls they pop
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
That's how it is for me 'cause I live a boss' life So many niggaz wanna play but still got dues to pay
Some of 'em gotta beg a bitch to stay
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
That's how it is for me 'cause I live a boss' life Now this is for the B's and the C's, and the D's and the H's
And the G's puttin' work in overseas
At ease with the Doggy and smoke some weed
Fuck it, if my nigga detoxin', it's more for me Baby, this is presidential really
A pocket full of women understandin' how I'm livin'
Show them hoes how you winnin'
It's the beginnin' with the pearls you're given
The world soft like linen and sweet like cinnamon But everyday like 50 say, it's 'Many Men'
They wanna take me out the spot
They want the pussy and the ends
But separate the paper and the Benz and the cribs
Then the hoes, then the clothes, I'ma have to let 'em go You know how the Dogg roll, don't get it twisted
'Cause he bang out the East just in case you wanna visit
A touch of the exquisite, mixed with somethin' pimpish
And it's comin' from the Beach where them niggaz is a beast But I just listen, all that shit is in my past
I'm connected to the purse first, nigga, the ass last
From Long Beach to Venice is the premise
Want the green like spinach and I'm strong to the finish See me, man, I'm nothin' like you
I got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to
Leanin' in my ride, fo' fifth, cock bangin'
Me, I'm ridin' by you on the corner, block slangin' I'm livin' that boss' life
The hoes come runnin' when they see me comin'
I'm livin' that boss' life
Can have anything, just don't fuck with my money This is for the West and the East and the Dirty South
Khaki's and them Tim's and them niggaz
With the platinum mouths
Thinkin' that they blessed by the actions that be comin' out
When you in Magic City, you be carryin' a lot of clout But trickin' ain't the route, that's even if you got it
There's a method to you holdin' it when they can't do without it
Just put the key up in it, nigga, if she 'bout it
You can have her and her partner, fuckin' with it for a dolla If she a balla, she gon' ride with a shot caller
Roll with the Bo$$ Dogg in the back of a blue Impala
And if she follow, then she gon' swallow
All the game you got to give her, be a different bitch tomorrow But I would never bother breakin' out 'Tha Doggfather'
'Less I knew that she was 'bout him, havin' diamonds on his collar
I'm just an author, spreadin' game to my partners
Walkin' on the blue carpet with the Doctor You see me man, I'm nothin' like you
I got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to
Leanin' in my ride, fo' fifth, cock bangin'
Me, I'm ridin' by you on the corner, block slangin' I'm livin' that boss' life
The hoes come runnin' when they see me comin'
I'm livin' that boss' life
Can have anything just don't fuck with my money Yeah, gotta say what's up to my nigga Slick Rick
For those who don't like it, eat a dick
But for those who with me, sing that shit
As it go a little something like this La Di Da Di, we likes to party
We don't cause trouble, we don't bother nobody
We're, just some niggaz who're on the mic
And when we rock up on the mic we rock the mic (right)
For all my Doggs keepin y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
Cuz it's cool when ya cause a cozy conditionin
Which we create, cuz that's our mission
So listen close, to what we say
Because this types of shit happens every-day
I woke up around 10 o'clock in the mornin
I gave myself a strech up, a mornin yawn and
went to the bathroom to wash up
I threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup
and said um "Mirror mirror, on, the wall
Who is the top Dogg of them all?"
There was a rubble dubble, five minutes it lasted
The mirror said, "You are you conceited bastard"
Well that's true, that's why we never have no beef
So I slipped off my khakis and my gold leaf
Used Oil of Olay, cuz my skin gets pale
And then I got the file, for my fingernails
I'm true to the style on my behalf
I put some bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath
Clean, dry, was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new Doggy underwear
for all the bitches I might take home
I got the Johnson baby powder and Cool Water cologne
Now I'm fresh, dressed, like a million bucks
Threw on my white sox, with my all blue chucks
Stepped out the house, stopped short, oh no
I went back in, I forgot my indo
Then I dilly (dally) I ran through an (alley)
I bumped into this smoker named (Sally) from the (Valley)
This was a girl playin hard to get So I said "What's wrong?" cuz she looked upset She said um It's all because of you, i'm feelin said and blue You went away, now my life is filled with rainy days
I love you so, how much you'll never know Cause you took your dope away from me
A-huh, a-huh, ahuh Damn, now what was I to do
She's cryin over me and she was feelin blue
I said, "Um, don't cry, dry your eye
And here comes your mother with those two little guys"
Her mean mother steps then says to me "Hi!!"
Decked Sally in the face and punched her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong, the kids was gone
Somethin was wrong I said, "What was goin on?"
I tried to break up, I said, "Stop it, just leave her!"
She said, "If I can't smoke none, she can't either!"
She grabbed my closely by my socks
So I broke the hell out, and I grabbed my sack of rocks
But um, they gave chase, they caught up quick
They started cryin on my shoes and grabbin my dick
and sayin... Why don't you give me a play
So we can brake it down the Long Beach way
And if you give me that okay
I'll give you all my love today
Doggy, Doggy, Doggy, can't you see
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways
Doggy Dogg, your love is here to stay And on and on and on she kept goin
The bitch been around before my mother's born!
I said, "Cheer up!" so I gave her a hit
I said, "You can't have me, I'm too young for you bitch!"
She said, "No you're not," then she starts cryin
I says I'm nineteen, she says, "Stop lyin!"
I says, "I am, go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy, I can't be your lover"

Fools don't respect nuttin but the gangbang (bang!) What's seen is what's saw, Dogg is the law
I have you niggas runnin like a marathon
Little G's tryna creep, on the East with it
Talkin 'bout they gon' get my chain and they gon' leave with it (nmm hmm!)
But they don't know once they get close It's Tic-Tac Toe, three motherfuckers laid on the floor (watch out!)
Yeah, this happened yesterday
On the West they spray - I heard the ese say, he said...
Vato, you won't believe what I saw I saw these pack of guys and they act real hard (and what they do?)
They twist the fingers and said, "You know who we are"
He said, "I don't give a fuck, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg" (uh huh!)
They keep buckin and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car (and what he get?) He got his gun and they start runnin' hard
He started firing and then he just charged

And smack ya neck back, ya drop off, fallin
I haven't seen my momma in a week
And she ain't even ran her mouth about me Fuck that, I ain't give a fuck about the law
Niggas say they wanna brawl, you would think that they were brawlers
Believing all the things that you never saw
In it y'all, been a Dogg, smoke you like a Menthol
You think you know? But this can't go You think you'll blow? On my door? What the fuck No!
See these niggas proceed to speed
So feel the need to leave or you'll hear my enemies goin...
Vato, you won't believe what I saw

And Snoop'll keep one foot on the streets
And leave 'em covered in sheets, run with them niggas with the heat
You never seen a thug like dis
You never seen a dub like me
And I ain't weak for wanting peace In fact I could be "Beast of the East" motherfucker!
I never hesitate to blaze (blaze!)
A nigga really tryna change his ways
We gotta move my team, cause my peoples Is screaming that we need more for fun or it's illegal
Put the bang on the song, make it feel like a drive-by (drive-by!)
It's a shame but somebody's gotta die (die!)
They see it happens state-to-state
But when I'm mobbin L.A., all I hear the ese's say - they go... Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack of guys and they act real hard (and what they do?)
They twist the fingers and said, "You know who we are"

A-hah, niggas be brown-nosing these hoes and shit
Taking bitches out to eat, and spending money on these hoes
Know what I'm saying?
I treat a bitch like 7-Up, I never have I never will
I tell a bitch like this: "Bitch, you without me is like Harold Melvin without Bluenotes You'll never go platinum!"
Hey Daz, give me a light nigga We'd like to welcome y'all to the fabulous Carolina West
I own this motherfucker and my name is Taa-Dow
Y'all niggas know who I am, y'all niggas tearin' up shit
But we got somethin' old, and somethin' new for y'all tonight
Put your hands together for Snoop Doggy Dogg
The Dogg Pound, and the fabulous Dramatics It's like everywhere I lizzook
And everywhere I go
I'm hearing motherfuckers trying to steal my flow
But it ain't no thang, cause, see, my homie Coolio
Put me up on the game when I stepped through the door Some of these niggas is so deceptive
Using my styles like a contraceptive I hope you get burnt Seems you haven't learnt
It's the knick-knack, patty-whack
I still got the biggest sack! So put your gun away, run away, cause I'm back Hit em up, get 'em up, spit 'em up
Now, tell me, what's going on?
It make me wanna holler, cause my dollars come in O-zones
Known for break off, shake off, now take off your
Clothes, and quit trying to spit at my motherfuckin' hoes!
Speaking of hoes, I'll get to the point
You think you got the bomb cause I rolled you a joint?
You'se a flea, and I'm the Big Dogg
I'll scratch you off my balls with my motherfuckin' paws
Y'alls niggas better recognize
And see where I'm coming from: it's still Eastside
Til I die. Why ask why?
As the world keeps spinning to the D-O-double G, Y It's a crazy, mixed-up world
It's a Doggy Dogg World Well if you give me 10 bitches then I'll fuck all 10
Seen the homie Snoop Doggy sipping juice and gin
Don't slip, I'm for the set-trip, to get papers
Styles vary, packing flavor like Lifesavers
Ain't that something?
Talk shit and I'm dumping
I had the fuckin' whole block bumpin'
Don't sweat, but check the technique. I'm unique like China
You'll never find a bomber rhymer than this nigga behind ya
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming through
1, 2, 3: you can't see me
I'm a G like that, strapped with hit-hard tactics
A fuckin' menace, using hoes like tennis rackets It's on again, It's on and popping All I see is green, so there ain't no stopping I wanna see some panties dropping
I'm coming from L.A
She used to chill with Dre up in Compton
(All I ever did was just use that ho Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)
I'm dishin out blues, I'm upsetting like bad news
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name's often marked for catchin slugs
And I smoke weed for the fuck of it
Ruff and rugged shit, it's unexplanatory how I gets wicked
But it's mandatory that I kick it
Check it, I'm runnin hoes in 94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin and movin
Prepare for a war, it's on, I'm head huntin
Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn
Peep, the massacre from a verbal assassin Murderin with rhymes packin Tec-9's for some action
You really don't know, do you, you fuckin wit a hog
You can't do me, I'm goin out looney like O-Dog Tha Dogg Pound rocks the party (all night long)
Til when? (Til the early morn')
And it don't stop, and it don't quit
For tha Dogg Pound clique to drop the cavi dough Diggity-Daz out of the motherfuckin' cut once more
So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow
I flip-flop and serve hows with a fat dick
Til I die, I'm still screaming out: "bitches ain't shit!"
Now I'm the mack daddy, had he not known about
The city where I'm from: Dum diddy dum
As you groove to the gangster shit
The D-O-double G, the P-O-U-N-D
The gangster clique
Now as the Pound break it down with the gangster funk
I can see and I can tell that's what the fuck you want

Peace...
Gz up, Hoes Down Nine in the mornin' feds at my door (my door)
Lou Cortez creakin' cross the hardwood floor (right)
Dippin' through the alley I made my escape
Didn't even get a chance to grab my Snoop Dogg tape
Man with no music but happy he's free
Bailin' fast as I can bail down 19th Street
I got my sacks in my pocket and at least a grand
Gold on my knuckle, my pistol's closed in hand
I'm a Dogg Pound Gangsta from the LBC
Remotely controlled by the bombity
But just livin' in big city is a serious task
Didn't know what the feds wanted, didn't have time to ask We're comin' with that G shit, that see shit that makin' niggas sick
How does it feel to see a G from your clique?
Wake up, jumped out of bed wit my grin on (why?)
Last night's dice game got my win on
About a G and a half is what I come with
But twenty five G's is what I left with
Teatley was the word I heard
I went deep in my pockets and threw my stars on the cone
Gimme the dice so I can break you niggas
I threw a see (C-I-X) so my point was the biggie
Seven-four-four-tre back to back
I sent two fools back to their lizzack See now I'm off to the graveyard shift
And I gots ta pay my dues to make my grip
But I chill 'cause my ho might call
Ain't no thang 'cause I sleeps all day and slang when night fall
And I takes a quick walk up the block
With my Glock cocked, ready to make a stop where I set up shop
On 59th and 8th Ave where all the homies be hangin'
That's where a nigga'll be slangin
I'm makin' a cool grip of shit, this ain't me
So I put my chips together and cops a quarter ki
And now the shops on deck
And everything that's mines I protect with a Tek, I don't half step
Now I got ends
And I'm rollin' a Lexus, fuck a Benz, and so many new friends
But I could only trust a few
And unawarely I trusted you
But if only G It's Snoop, homies from the motherfuckin get-go
Devoted and quotin', back in '84
I was thirteen, G was a year older
But I still wadn't afraid to throw him from his shoulders
Gettin' good on the hood was the anticipation
And yeah, King Park was the destination
Every nigga that I knew was at the Park that night
Even the smokers that be levellin' gettin' sparked tonight Back on the streets, straight blue and grey
'Cause I represent like every day
Nigga you can't tell me I don't be on the spot
When I can tell you all the homies that done get shot
From at least about five years ago
When I was in junior high goin' to Marshall
The homey use to come up to the school and rock
And leave and have the bitches flockin' his jock
Damn them was the days of the past
But since the Pizzound formed we been whippin' people's ass
And everybody a blast
And if you don't believe me nigga you can axe the homey Daz
And that's your ass
Fucked around and let Young Swoop take your cash (ha ha)
He didn't even run, he walked away (bust)
'cause I let it sit that day
I wished I was there I would've clowned
But that's why we axed your bitch ass from the Pound
'cause he wouldn't even squad back
Man we can't fuck with no niggas like that
He'll get us all cracked
If the police was behind us, he wouldn't even jump out with the strap
Now that's what I call a beeyatch! (Beeiyitch!)
I second the emotion you was dropped the clique (yeah yeah) Some of these nigga are bitches too
And some of these niggas look just like you
So if you've ever been toetone
Go out and get your roll on you punk ass nigga, you'll get stole on It's 5: 30 in the mornin', now I'm yizzawnin
Now as I perceive to get G to a tee
And before I bail to school you know I blaze up a sack
Another day, another dollar for the gangsta mack
Bitch act like you know, show me some sex and affection
And let me dial slow, flossin', tossin' a bitch (bitch)
Yeah Dogg, one more thing I forgot to mention
Shoot five niggas, shoot ten
Shoot the piece, slip to your fiends
Seven, goddamn it, when it deal
A '64 for the honeys, straight ho for the G
Young Daz, little nigga you can't fuck with me Now I knew that them niggas couldn't get at you
So what made them niggas try to spit at you
Disrespect a gang that snitch on you
Y'all punk ass niggas, man y'all some bitches too Who got some gangsta gangsta shit? (ha ha)
Swoop G, I heard somebody's speakin up on you
'Cause when I drop mines there was no more nickels and dimes
Just quarters, ounces, half ounces and quota
PC is the season and I don't smoke blunt
It sees the indo with skunk, I might as well get drunk
To smoke some stress, that shit'll put a hole in your chest
I only want another twenty dollar, sure got me fucked up
My hood is gettin' hot and niggas is tryin ta plottin'
Come up off a young nigga, call his shots
Swoop G ain't the one, I do its to be done (aah)
Al-ways have my gun and my G from 2-1
It's Cerritos but you don't hear me though 'cause you don't really know
About the you-know, I'm Cerritos, silly ho

Snoop dogg! snoop dogg! (snoop...) x4 [verse 2, snoop]
I see these rappers in this game be doin way too much
Actin tough with this east-west coast stuff
See me, I'm all about my money man
I stay fly and dry
I don't get caught up in the rain
'cause game (game) recognize game (game)
No matter where you from, we all can get dumb, insane
And turn the party out without a doubt
Unless you them fools who ain't got no clout
Lbc and beware of my crew
'cause uh, we out there stuck on the crazy glue
Upside ya head like oops, snoop's the lick
That you hear them bumpin in the hoops
You can't afford it homeboy, this is finished
I represented from v-a to venice
So when it's timid and cold outside
Rely on the d-o dub to put the heat in yo life Chorus.

It takes a whole lot, to be number one
I can't walk down the street without my gun
I can't trust these fools, fly, it ain't no fun
I'm sittin' up in court 'cause somebody got done
What really counts is how the crowd bounce
Go home and say snoop rocked the partay
Nobody got killed, it's what got annouced
I guess they got a chance to see dr. bombay
But I keep my heat in case brothas get cold
Warm you up with the sheet, zip you up and roll
Now, doggystyle records is now official
I'm gettin paper out the plizate with my initials
Shippin weapons overseas, I'm makin g's
With who you might call enemies
But i, see nothin funny about makin money
'cause uh, we all know it don't grow on trees
So i...
Gotta get what I gotta get when I? shake?
I'm up early in the morning with the homie nate
Burning rubber down to get a new car
So don't get jealous when you see me in the double r Chorus. [outro, snoop]
Now just ride to this, uh, bounce to this, uh, c-walk to this
Uh, whoo-ride to this, uh, eastside to this, uh, westside to this

Take it for granted, if ya wanna, cuz I'm gonna

Comin with a group of gangsta shit for ninety-three
So ninety-four's arrived nigga, back on up
And let me and my Dogg Kurupt fuck shit up
Now can't nobody see me here or there
wherever I bails, I put it down on the ground
Cuz ain't shit for sale in the Coupe
with the beat flossin off gold D's
And my cousin Snoop packs well, you know what I mean
And it don't take much, for the Dogg Pound to bust a cap
in your ass, for gettin us all fucked up
Now check it, it's a callin for niggaz like Doggs
who supposed to be the shit, but steadily bitchin like hogs
(Yes y'all) Walk the Doggs (yes y'all) Yiggy y'all
Stay full of that gin and juice and have a ball I packs a strap, like that, I kicks it like this
Now how many bitches must get dick?
Before they say, that Daz is that nigga from back in the day
Ya never ever thought I'd see him bustin with Dr. Dre
Cuz I grips mics, I rips mics in half
Hoes be comin to my flat so I can tap that ass Chorus Verse Three: Kurupt You're headed my way, nigga you best to hit a U-turn quick
So what's happenin? I'm cappin shit up like a Western flick

The run of the mill fool get broke off for tryin to serve

I smoke chronic everyday, so what have we
Another motherfucker, gettin served like some cavy
Now who, drops (ruff rhymes) I got full Juice like 2Pac
(plus I'm) rollin with two Glocks
Fly motherfuckers can't see Kurupt
Hellraisin like Pinhead, beware I'm tearin shit the fuck up
Slow your roll, like your legs was broken
Who's jokin? Rakim never joked, so why should I loc?
Now that's my idol, check the vital rhyme flow doe
Runnin em like Flo Jo, stranded on Death Row
Mediocre motherfuckers die cuz I'm servin it
They can't fuck with or see me I'm mass murderin
[Smokin indo, look out my window I suppose] Yeah
[Niggaz don't understand how we kicks diffrent flows]
(I'm raw like new footage) I'm rugged like a BF Goodrich
(Bring your whole set and get your hood lynched)
[Drop to your knees like a dog in heat]
Peep the murderous styles and the poetical techiques Chorus Verse Four: Rage Check it out, it's Rage, ready for the breakdown
Take down, when it comes to the mic I'm puttin my weight down
And that's 175 pounds of beed
beatin yo' ass down to the concrete
Fool, act like ya know
I'm stranded on Death Row with no where to go, so
What's a girl to do
Take out a crew, or two, a few, what you wanna do? [Snoop] Throw your guns in the motherfuckin air, we don't care
[Dogg Pound] Niggaz don't give a fuck nigga

Hey Snoop Dogg, can you give us a bedtime story?
Alright, hand me my backwoods, here we go [Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Just another day in my old neighborhood
Not bad meanin' bad but bad meanin' good
Time flies by with the boomin' system
Shot by my head, I popped back and I missed 'em
So I kept shootin' 'til I ran outta shots
Then I threw my gun at him and I ran up the block
Swang them hoes, bang them hoes
20 minutes later, I changed them clothes
For a disguise, east side niggas is back
Ain't heard your new shit 'cause you niggas is whack
I came to this party all by myself
But I won't leave by myself
I got his, hers and your bitch too
They all come through, it's sorta like a rendez-vous
I'm so true to this shit, never new to this shit
Kick back and watch your big homie do this shit [Chorus: Kokane]
Niggas weren't made to break me
'Cause all I just do is shine

Well, I watch out
Better get them starchild
That's the XO bottle
Leave shit with the model

Hangin' by the high school, blowin' in the trees
4 little, 5 little, 6 TCs
Watch a nigga back one and dip it through with ease
7 little, 8 little, 9 little hoes
Wanna kick it, I suppose, gettin' tickets to my shows
10 to 11 but a dozen on the rose
Gave that bitch to my cousin 'cause he hard on the nose
Hey, you know how shit goes, make that bitch strike a pose
Triple O to the N so you know that bitch chose
So cold, make a nigga freeze, hoes down, nigga, Gs up [Chorus: Kokane]
Niggas weren't made to break me
'Cause all I just do is shine
[?] bang bang boogie
Cross [?] by moi
S to the N, double O, P

Niggas gonna get real lenny
Guaranteed it'll blow your mind [Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
I did a whole lotta gutta shit
But lookin' back at it, young loc, Cuz, I'm on some other shit
Intellectual, misdirectional
Correct yourself so you can avoid correctional facilities
Mental stability, validity
Everythin' you look at ain't what it appear to be
Compellin' you, sellin' you, I'm tellin' you this
See poppin' this shit is like knockin' a bitch
I'm cold with it, rock roll with it, trick hoes with it
Nick Foles with it, get it, I be the backup, second in line
See when I get in, you ain't gettin' no more time
I'm free as a bird, C is the word, nigga, I did that, nigga
Never switchin' up, my nigga, let's get this shit back
True to this shit, never new to this shit
Kick back and watch your big homie do this shit [Chorus: Kokane]

I'm in the party low-key, blowin' an eighth of dro
I'm playful but I don't play Spinnin' the globe like the strobe
Like the club packed, my flow right the whole night
If I plan to go right, a cold night
In hell before I fail, I'm alright Man, I'm like a flash of lightnin'
Breath of fresh air, classic debonair
Glass of champagne, hold it in my right hand
Finger roll cold, Dogg the Ice Man Brazil to Iceland
I shine like a million lights, man
The talk of the town, believe it or doubt it
I don't need to shout it, you better read about it Snoop Dogg is out, you wanna be there partyin'
All night long until the break of dawn
Ooh wee, ooh wee, ooh

I love it when you dance, so sexy
I love it when you in that night mood
Slow motion movin' like ain't nothin' like you I'm feelin' good doin' what I like to
Suited up, pimp stripe, light blue
I let it do what it might do
Fresh and crispy, the rest a mystery I'm blessed with history
No less than best, catch the rest
Live in the flesh, smooth with the style I choose
Not off the stress, I'm hot off the press Snoop Dogg is out, you wanna be there partyin'
All night long until the break of dawn

If it ain't one thing it's a motherfuckin nother
Word to my granny and my daddy, and my mother
Whether standin on the corner, or bouncin in the six-deuce
When I was locked up, I couldn't wait to get loose
Cuz back in the days, on the side where it's at
A nigga had to have a fat stack
And I was a fool, don't make me have to grab my strap and go
rat-tat-tat-tat, nigga slap to a motherfucker face he fall
Can't none of y'all niggaz see the Doggy Dogg

Listen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg (pump pump) Verse Two: Snoop Now you can look to the Sun, and spot the moon

One rude bwoy comin with the darkness (blam!)
Close your eyes cuz you can't see me

Makes me wanna hit that ass up with the Dogg Pound Chorus Verse Three: Malik Now just back up, don't act up, I pack up much heat

Though I bossed up, it ain't hard to tell that I came up hard as Hell, check it out
I stayed sharp and played my part
All I had was a mic, a dream and some heart
Me and my moms wasn't getting along at this time And since pops was gone, I'm out grinding
Catch a nigga praying, swearing I ain't going back to jail
Judge about tired of a playa, I don't know about this bidness shit
But I'm good with this rapping, can I get a witness, what's happening That's about the time, I put down the rocks

I up my status, ain't no more Calvin Broadus World on my shoulder, but I can handle it
Now that I'm older, I'm sharper and colder
Can you remember when I slid in Deep Cover
And made niggas in the Beach love each other A street hustler, but I'm all set for the come up
Best kept secret so I'm want up
I've been acquitted up for 1-8-7
Yes, I'm blessed thank God in Heaven Now all I need is a push in the right direction
Weed and a mic now, I'm writing checks
And now the game ain't stopping
And can't nobody say my name ain't popping Started off young as a little-bitty buck
Now I'm ready for the world, and I got to give it up It's the one and only D-O double G
Do you want some of this
Top Dogg, bite 'em all, yeah, I'm burning it up
Aw naw, Big Snoop Dogg
You tuned in to the number one
Buck one, buck two, buck three, buck four
So get real fool, fool You in the presence of a motherfucking millionaire
Stop, look, listen, feel, yeah, I ain't tripping on shit
I worked hard as a motherfucker
Fuck Cuzz, and him too 'cause all y'all suckas Now with the savvy of a business man
I gave, new niggas a chance, to see what they was saying
And kept a spot on hot, West Coast on lock
Big Dizzel knocking down your block Never looking back, uh uh, a steady process
And leaving that way, 'cause see I'm blessed
It's like I'm happy now, 'cause I'm a family man
I fell in love with my kids and my wife again And these here are the files of a classic
It's my throne till I choose to pass it
Worldwide and the sun shine so bright
That's why I wear my yellow C's at night, nigga It's the one and only D-O double G
Do you want some of this
Top Dogg, bite 'em all, yeah, I'm burning it up
Aw naw, Big Snoop Dogg
You tuned in to the number one
Buck one, buck two, buck three, buck four
So get real fool, fool It's the one and only
It's the one and only
It's the one and only D-O double G

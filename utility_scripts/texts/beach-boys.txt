I'll be back in ten minutes There's a time a for joy
A time for tears
A time we'll treasure through the years
We'll remember always
Graduation day At the senior prom
We danced 'til three
And there you gave your heart to me
We'll remember always
Graduation day Though we leave in sorrow
All the joys we've known
We can face tomorrow
Knowing we'll never walk alone When the ivy walks
Are far behind
No matter where our paths may wind
We'll remember always
Graduation day We'll remember always
Graduation day Instrumental We-de-de-de, de-de-de-de-de de, we-um-um-a-way (drum fill)
We-de-de-de, de-de-de-de-de de, we-um-um-a-way A wimoweh, a-wimoweh a-wimoweh, a wimoweh

In the jungle the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight
In the jungle the quiet jungle the lion sleeps tonight Near the village the peaceful village the lion sleeps tonight
Near the village the quiet village the lion sleeps tonight (repeat wimoweh chorus)
Hush my darling, don't fear my darling. The lion sleeps tonight.
Hush my darling, don't fear my darling.The lion sleeps tonight INSTRUMENTAL A pirate with a tune on a Holiday.
Ol' lazy Mr. Moon want a getaway.
And isn't that a moon for a Milky Way?
A ukulele lady around a lei.
Rock, rock, roll...
Rock, rock. Roll Plymouth rock, roll over.
For a Holiday.
With a roundelay. (Abaft and forth!
A starboard course with North abeam,
Sherry of course!
The men will share some sport ah-now me hearty!
Not the rum of Carib' scum!
It's Port tonight, drink up and come!
Un-weigh the anchor YANK and we will party!) A shanty town, a chanty in Waikiki.
And juxtapose a man with a mystery.
A blue Hawaiian captures his melody.
And Liliuola Kalani will sing to me.
Rock, rock, roll...
Rock, rock. Roll Plymouth rock, roll over.
For a Holiday. Whisperin' wind send my wind chimes a-tinklin'. I'll be back in ten minutes There's a time a for joy
A time for tears
A time we'll treasure through the years
We'll remember always
Graduation day At the senior prom
We danced 'til three
And there you gave your heart to me
We'll remember always
Graduation day Though we leave in sorrow
All the joys we've known
We can face tomorrow
Knowing we'll never walk alone When the ivy walks
Are far behind
No matter where our paths may wind
We'll remember always
Graduation day We'll remember always
Graduation day

[spoken introduction:]
This is one that we didn't write, and you'll remember it. I say: 1, 2, 3, 4! Too many teardrops for one heart
To be cryin'
Too many teardrops for one heart
To carry on
Been way on top now
Since you left me
You're always laughin'
Way down at me
But watch out now
I'm gonna get him
And we'll be together
For just a little while
And then I'm gonna put you
Way down here
You'll start cryin'
In the sunshine
Ninety-six tears
Hey, cry
Cry
And be terrible
And cry
And feel terrible
And cry
Uh-huh, and cry
Uh-huh And when the sun comes up
I'll be on top
You'll be down here
Lookin' up
And I might wave
To come up here
I look for you
But I don't see you
Wavin' now
So I don't now
I'll just cry
I'll just cry
I'll just cry Too many teardrops for one heart
To be cryin'
Too many teardrops for one heart
To carry on
Well now
You're gonna shout it from the top, girl
I'll hear it from the bottom
You'll shout it from the album
And work out all night
I say, 96
And I say, night and day
I say, rock and roll, baby
Eh, move on out
I say, 96 tears
Let's take a three-year letter
I say, 1-2, 96, 1-2! When you get out of the hospital
Let me back into your life
I can't stand what you do
I'm in love with your eyes
And when you get out of the dating bar
I'll be here to get back into your life
I can't stand what you do
I'm in love with your eyes
Oh, I can't stand what you do
Sometimes I can't stand you
And it makes me think about me
That I'm involved with you
But I'm in love with this power that shows through in your eyes I go to bakeries all day long
There's a lack of sweetness in my life
And there is pain inside
You can see it in my eyes
Oh there is pain inside
You can see it in my eyes
Makes me think about me
That I've lost my pride
But I'm in love with this power that resides in your eyes You live in modern apartments
Well I even got scared once or twice
Last time I walked down your street
There were tears in my eyes
Well these streets
We all know
They help us cry when we're alone late at night
Don't you love them too?
That where you got your eyes?
Oh I can't stand what you do
Sometimes I can't stand you
And it makes me think about me
How I'm involved with you
But I'm in love with this power that shows through in your eyes Now... your world
It is beautiful
I'll take the subway to your suburb sometime
I'll seek out the places that must have been magic
to your little girl mind
Now as a little girl
You must have been magic
I still get jealous of your old boyfriends
in the suburbs sometimes
And when I walk down your street
Probably be tears in my eyes
(I knew it would happen)
I can't stand what you do
Sometimes I can't stand you
And it makes me think about me
That I'm involved with you
But I'm in love with this power that shows through in your eyes So... when you get out of the hospital
Let me back into your life
I can't stand what you do
But I'm in love with your eyes I called this number three times already today
But I. I got scared, I put it back in place (I put my phone back in place)
I still don't know if I, should have called up
Look... just tell me, why, don't you, if I'm. out of place
Cause here's your chance to make me feel awkward
And wish that I had never even called up this place I saw you though today
Walk by with Hippie Johnny
I had to call up and say
How I wanna take his place So this phonecall today concerns Hippie Johnny
He's always stoned
He's never straight I saw you today, you know
Walk by with Hippie Johnny
Look, I had to call up and say
I wanna take his place See, he's stoned
Hippie Johnny
Now get this: I'm straight.
And I want to take his place Now, look, I like him too, I like
Hippie Johnny
But I'm straight
And I want to take his place I said: I'm straight
I said I'm straight
I'm proud to say.
Well, I'm straight
And I want to take his place Now I've watched you walk around here
I've watched you meet
Boyfriends, you know, and you tell me how they're deep
But look, I think these guys.
If they're really so great
Tell me, why they can't they at least take this place
And take it straight? Why always stoned?
Like Hippie Johhny is
I'm straight
And I want to take his place
I'm certainly not stoned
like Hippie Johhny is
I'm straight
And I want to take his place
I said: I'm straight!
I said I'm straight!
I'm...
I'm straight
And I want to... I'm straight! (tell the world now!)
I'm straight (that's it!)
I'm straight (yeah)
I'm straight
And I want to take his place [spoken introduction:]

Whistle down the wind
Let your voices carry
Drown out all the rain
Light a patch of darkness
Treacherous and scary Howl at the stars
Whisper when you're sleeping
I'll be there to hold you
I'll be there to stop
The chills and all the weeping Make it clear and strong
So the whole night long
Every signal that you send
Until the very end
I will not abandon you my precious friend So try to stem the tide
Then you'll raise a banner
Send a flare up in the sky
Try to burn a torch
And try to build a bonfire Every signal that you send
Until the very end
I'm there So whistle down the wind
For I have always been
Right there Howl at the stars
Whisper when your sleeping
I'll be there to hold you
I'll be there to stop
The chills and all the weeping Make it clear and strong
So the whole night long
Every signal that you send
Until the very end
I will not abandon you my precious friend So try to stem the tide
Then you'll raise a banner
Send a flare up in the sky
Try to burn a torch
And try to build a bonfire Every signal that you send
Until the very end
I'm there So whistle down the wind
For I have always been
Right there. You ought to know about Mr. Mistoffelees the original Conjuring Cat.
(There can be no doubt about that.) Please listen to me and don't scoff.
All his inventions are off his own bat. there's no such cat in the Metropolis:
He holds all the patent monopolies,
For performing surprising illusions and creating eccentric confusions. The greatest magicians have something to learn
From Mister Mistoffelees Conjuring Turn.
And you'll all say:
Oh! well I never was there ever a cat so clever as Magical Mister Mistoffelees. He is quiet he is small he is black,
From his ears to the tip of his tail.
He can creep through the tiniest crack,
He can walk on the narrowest rail. He can pick any card from a pack,
He is equally cunning with dice.
He is always deceiving you into believing that he's only hunting for mice.
He can play any trick with a cork, Or a spoon and a bit of fish paste.
If you look for a knife or a fork
And you think it is merely misplaced;
You have seen it one moment and then it is gone,
But you find it next week lying out on the lawn. [Chorus: x2]
And we all say: Oh!
Well I never was there ever a cat so clever as Magical Mister Mistoffelees. My manner is vague and aloof,
You would think there is nobody shyer,
But my voice has been heard on the roof
When I was curled up by the fire, And I've sometimes been heard by the fire;
When I was around on the roof
(At least they all heard that somebody purred)
Which is incontestable proof Of my singular magical powers,
And I've known the family to call
Me in the garden for hours
While I was asleep in the hall. And not long ago this phenomenal cat
Produced seven kittens right out of a hat! [Chorus] And not long ago this phenomenal cat,
Produced seven kittens right out of a hat! [Chorus] Love, love changes everything
Hands and faces, earth and sky
Love, love changes everything
How you live and how you die Love can make the summer fly
Or a night seem like a lifetime
Yes love, love changes everything
Now I tremble at your name
Nothing in the world will ever be the same Love, love changes everything
Days are longer, words mean more
Love, love changes everything
Pain is deeper than before Love will turn your world around
And that world will last for ever
Yes love, love changes everything
Brings you glory, brings you shame
Nothing in the world will ever be the same Off into the world we go
Planning futures, shaping years
Love bursts in and suddenly
All our wisdom disappears Love makes fools of everyone
All the rules we make are broken
Yes love, love changes everyone
Live or perish in its flame
Love will never, never let you be the same Love will never, never let you be the same! Jesus I only want to say
If there is a way
Take this cup away from me
For I don't want to taste its poison
Feel it burn me
I have changed I'm not as sure, as when we started
Then, I was inspired
Now, I'm sad and tired
Listen, surely I've exceeded expectations
Tried for three years, seems like thirty
Could you ask as much from any other man? But if I die
See the saga through and do the things you ask of me,
Let them hate me, hit me, hurt me, nail me to their tree
I'd want to know, I'd want to know, my God
I'd want to know, I'd want to know, my God
Want to see, I'd want to see, my God
Want to see, I'd want to see, my God Why I should die
Would I be more noticed than I ever was before?
Would the things I've said and done matter any more?
I'd have to know, I'd have to know, my Lord
Have to know, I'd have to know, my Lord
Have to see, I'd have to see, my Lord
Have to see, I'd have to see, my Lord
If I die what will be my reward?
If I die what will be my reward?
Have to know, I'd have to know, my Lord
I'd have to know, I'd have to know, my Lord Why should I die? Oh why should I die?
Can you show me now that I would not be killed in vain?
Show me just a little of your omnipresent brain
Show me there's a reason for your wanting me to die
You're far to keen and where and how, but not so hot on why Alright, I'll die!
Just watch me die!
See how I die!
Then I was inspired
Now, I'm sad and tired
After all, I've tried for three years, seems like ninety
Why then am I scared to finish what I started
What you started, I didn't start it God, thy will is hard
But you hold every card
I will drink your cup of poison
Nail me to your cross and break me
Bleed me, beat me
Kill me
Take me, now!
Before I change my mind Who knows when love begins
Who knows what makes it start
One day it's simply there
Alive inside your heart It slips into your thoughts
It infiltrates your soul
It takes you by surprise
Then seizes full control Try to deny it
And try to protest
But love won't let you go
Once you've been possessed Love never dies
Love never falters
Once it has spoken
Love is yours Love never fades
Love never alters
Hearts may get broken
Love endures
Hearts may get broken
Love endures And soon as you submit
Surrender flesh and bone
That love takes on a life
Much bigger than your own It uses you at whim
And drives you to despair
And forces you to feel
More joy than you can bear Love gives you pleasure
And love brings you pain
And yet when both are gone
Love will still remain Once it has spoken
Love is yours Love never dies
Love never alters Hearts may get broken
Love endures
Hearts may get broken Love never dies
Love will continue
Love keeps on beating
When you're gone Love never dies
Once it is in you
Life may be fleeting
Love lives on
Life may be fleeting Love lives on You must be mistaken
It couldn't have been
You couldn't have seen him yesterday
He's doing some deal up in Baltimore now
I hate it when he's away You must be mistaken
I'm sure that you are
There's more than one car with stickers on
And lots of young guys wear corduroy pants
And I'd know if he hadn't gone Take that look off your face (take that look off your face)
I can see through your smile (I can see through your smile)
You would love to be right
I bet you didn't sleep good last night
Couldn't wait to bring all of that bad news to my door
Well, I've got news for you
I knew before If I'm not mistaken, it started last year
I'm not very clear how it began
I noticed a change but I just closed my eyes
As only a woman can No, I didn't dig deep (No, I didn't dig deep)
I did not want to know (I did not want to know)
Well, you don't interfere
When you're scared of the things you might hear
When he's back, you think I will end it right there and then
Well, my fair weather friend,
You're wrong again (Take that look off your face) take that look off your face
(I can see through your smile) I can see through your smile
You would love to be right
I bet you didn't sleep good last night
Couldn't wait to bring all of that bad news to my door
Well, I've got news for you
I knew before (Take that look off your face)
I can see through your smile (I can see through your smile)
You would love to be right
I bet you didn't sleep good last night
Couldn't wait to bring all of that bad news to my door
Well, I've got news for you
I knew before (Take that look off your face)
I can see through your smile (I can see through your smile)
You would love to be right
I bet you didn't sleep good last night
Couldn't wait to bring all of that bad news to my door
Well, I've got news for you
I knew before I don't know how to love him.
What to do, how to move him.
I've been changed, yes really changed.
In these past few days, when I've seen myself, I seem like someone else.
I don't know how to take this.
I don't see why he moves me.
He's a man. He's just a man. And I've had so many men before,
In very many ways,
He's just one more.
Should I bring him down? Should I scream and shout?
Should I speak of love,
Let my feelings out?
I never thought I'd come to this. What's it all about?
Don't you think it's rather funny,
I should be in this position.
I'm the one who's always been So calm, so cool, no lover's fool,
Running every show.
He scares me so.
I never thought I'd come to this. What's it all about?
Yet, if he said he loved me,
I'd be lost. I'd be frightened.
I couldn't cope, just couldn't cope. I'd turn my head. I'd back away.
I wouldn't want to know.
He scares me so.
I want him so. I love him so. CHRISTINE: Love's a curious thing
It often comes disguised
Look at love the wrong way
It goes un-recognized So look with your heart
And not with your eyes
A heart understands
A heart never lies Believe what it feels
And trust what it shows
Look with your heart
The heart always knows Love is not always beautiful
Not at the start So open your arms
And close your eyes tight
Look with your heart
And when it finds love
Your heart will be right Learn from someone who knows
Make sure you don't forget
Love you misunderstand
Is love that you'll regret GUSTAVE: Mother Look with your heart
And not with your eyes
The heart can't be fooled
Christine: The heart is too wise GUSTAVE: Forget what you think
CHRISTINE: Ignore what you hear
BOTH: Look with your heart
It always sees clear GUSTAVE: Love is not always beautiful
Not at the start CHRISTINE: But open your arms
And close your eyes tight
Look with your heart
And when it finds love
Your heart will be right No more talk of darkness,
Forget these wide-eyed fears;
I'm here, nothing can harm you,
My words will warm and calm you. Let me be your freedom,
Let daylight dry your tears;
I'm here, with you, beside you,
To guard you and to guide you. Say you love me every waking moment,
Turn my head with talk of summertime.
Say you need me with you now and always;
Promise me that all you say is true,
That's all I ask of you. Let me be your shelter,
Let me be your light;
You're safe, no one will find you,
Your fears are far behind you. All I want is freedom,
A world with no more night;
And you, always beside me,
To hold me and to hide me. Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime;
Let me lead you from your solitude.
Say you need me with you, here beside you,
Anywhere you go, let me go too,
Christine, that's all I ask of you Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime;
Say the word and I will follow you. Share each day with me,
Each night, each morning. Say you love me!
RAOUL
You know I do. Anywhere you go, let me go to
Love me, that's all I ask of you.
(they kiss) I must go
They'll wonder where I am
Wait for me Raoul! Christine I love you! Order your fine horses!
Be with them at the door! And soon you'll be beside me! You'll guard me and you'll guide me
(they hurry off and the phantom emerges from behind the statue) I gave you my music
Made your song take wing
And now how you've repaid me
Denied me and betrayed me
He was bound to love you when he heard you sing
Christine
Christine Say you'll share with me one love,
One lifetime say the word and I will follow you
Share each day with me, each night, each morning You will curse the day you did not do
All that the Phantom asked of you! Go! Christine:
Think of me
Think of me fondly
When we've said goodbye
Remember me
Once in a while
Please promise me you'll try When you find
That once again you long
To take your heart back and be free
If you ever find a moment
Spare a thought for me We never said our love was evergreen
Or as unchanging as the sea
But if you can still remember
Stop and think of me Think of all the things we've shared and seen
Don't think about the way things might have been Think of me
Think of me waking
Silent and resigned
Imagine me
Trying too hard
To put you from my mind Recall those days
Look back on all those times
Think of the things we'll never do
There will never be a day
When I won't think of you Raoul:
Can it be
Can it be Christine
Bravo!
Long ago
It seems so long ago
How young and innocent we were
She may not remember me
But I remember her Christine:
Flowers fade
The fruits of summer fade
They have their seasons
So do we
But please promise me that sometimes
You will think of me (Gustave)
Ooh (Christine)
Gustave, could you hand me those earrings
The diamond ones on the left?
There, how do I look? (Gustave)
You look so beautiful
So very beautiful
Like a queen in a book (Christine)
You too are beautiful
So very beautiful
Once this performance is through
We'll spend some time just us two
Won't that be fun? (Gustave)
Father, doesn't mother look lovely tonight? (Raoul)
Indeed she does
As lovely as she looked the very first time
I came to her dressing room door (Christine)
And look at you, Raoul
Huh?
You look just like that handsome boy in the opera box
The one who'd always toss me a single red rose (Raoul)
Please, Gustave, if you don't mind
Would you wait outside a while? (Gustave)
May I go exploring, by myself? (Christine)
Yes, but stay backstage, my dear
When I'm finished, meet me here (Gustave)
I will (Raoul)
Since our wedding day, things have gone astray
(Christine) Raoul
I'm not proud of the way that I've acted
(Christine) We've both been
The demands I've made, all the hopes mislaid
I'm aware of the price they've exacted Though I've no right to ask you to
There's one thing more I'd have you do
If you love me as I love you (Christine) Anything, darling
(Raoul)Don't sing the song, dear
(Christine) What?
But, Raoul
(Raoul) You have to know
Something's terribly wrong, dear (Christine) But I have to do this
It's what we agreed to
(Raoul) That hell-spawn demon
He's had us playing his game all along, dear
(Christine) Let me just get through this
Listen, please, I need to (Raoul)
You need so much, it's true
And I've denied you
You need the man you knew
Back here beside you You'll have him back, I vow
Just ask it of me
But we must leave here now
If you still love me (Christine) Do you mean it, Raoul, truly? (Raoul)
I've booked a passage for three
To Cherbourg on the Atlantic Queen, it leaves in an hour
We'll have just enough time, I beg you
Let's be on it for both our sakes
And the child's Leave this place behind (Phantom)
He knows his love is not enough
He knows he isn't what you need
He knows you're made of finer stuff
I think on that we're all agreed It's time to leave him in the dust
It's time to be who you should be
It's time to do now as you must
And set the music in you free In moments, mere moments
Drums will roll
There you'll stand just like before The crowd will hush
And then in one sweet rush
I will hear you sing once more And music, our music
Will swell and then unwind
Like two strands of melody at last entwined Fulfill us, complete us
Make us whole
Seal our bond forever more Tonight, for me
Embrace your destiny
Let me hear you sing once more (Stage)
Miss Daae, it's time (Christine)
Twisted every way
What answer can I give? I know I can't refuse
And yet I wish I could
Oh, God (Raoul)
Christine, Christine
Don't think that I don't care
(Phantom)
But every hope and every prayer
Rests on you now ANDRE:
Ludicrous!
Have you seen the score? FIRMIN:
Simply ludicrous! ANDRE:
It's the final straw! FIRMIN:
This is lunacy!
Well, you know my views ANDRE:
...Utter lunacy! FIRMIN:
But we daren't refuse ... ANDRE:
Not another
chandelier FIRMIN:
...Look, my friend, what
we have here ... ANDRE:
"Dear Andre,
Re my orchestrations:
We need another first bassoon.
Get a player with tone -
and that third trombone
has to go!
The man could not be deafer,
so please preferably one
who plays in tune!" FIRMIN:
"Dear Firmin,
vis a vis my opera:
some chorus-members must be sacked.
If you could, find out which
has a sense of pitch -
wisely, though,
I've managed to assign a
rather minor role to those
who cannot act!" CARLOTTA:
Outrage! FIRMIN:
What is it now? CARLOTTA:
This whole affair is
an outrage! ANDRE:
Now what's the matter? CARLOTTA:
Have you seen
the size of my part? ANDRE:
Signora, listen ... PIANGI:
It's an insult! FIRMIN:
Not you as well! PIANGI:
Just look at this -
it's an insult! FIRMIN:
Please, understand ... ANDRE:
Signor! Signora! CARLOTTA:
The things I have
to do for my art! PIANGI:
If you can call
this gibberish "art" ! CARLOTTA:
Ah! Here's our little flower! FIRMIN:
Ah Miss Daae,
quite the lady
of the hour! ANDRE:
You have
secured the largest role
in this "Don Juan". CARLOTTA:
Christine Daae?
She doesn't have
the voice! FIRMIN:
Signora, please! RAOUL:
Then I take it
you're agreeing. CARLOTTA:
She's behind this ... ANDRE:
It appears we have
no choice. CARLOTTA:
She's the one
behind this!
Christine Daae! CHRISTINE:
How dare you! CARLOTTA:
I'm not a fool! CHRISTINE:
You evil woman!
How dare you! CARLOTTA:
You think I'm blind? CHRISTINE:
This isn't my fault!
I don't want any
part in this plot! FIRMIN:
Miss Daae, surely ... ANDRE:
But why not? PIANGI:
What does she say? FIRMIN:
It's your decision
But why not? CARLOTTA:
She's backing out! ANDRE:
You have a duty! CHRISTINE:
I cannot sing it,
duty or not! RAOUL:
Christine ...
Christine ...
You don't have to ...
they can't make you ... GIRY:
Please, monsieur:
another note.
"Fondest greetings
to you all !
A few instructions
just before
rehearsal starts: ERIK:
Carlotta must be
taught to act ... ,"
... not her normal trick
of strutting round the stage.
Our Don Juan must
lose some weight -
it's not healthy in
a man of Piangi's age.
And my managers
must learn
that their place is in
an office, not the arts. As for Miss Christine Daae ...
No doubt she'll
do her best - it's
true her voice is
good. She knows, though,
should she wish to excel
she has much still
to learn, if pride will
let her
return to me, her
teacher,
her teacher ... GIRY:
Your obedient friend ...
"... and Angel ..." RAOUL:
We have all been
blind - and yet the
answer is staring us
in the face ...
This could be the
chance to ensnare our
clever friend ... ANDRE:
We're listening FIRMIN:
...Go on. RAOUL:
We shall play his
game - perform his
work - but remember we
hold the ace ...
For, if Miss Daae
sings, he is certain
to attend ... ANDRE:
We make certain
the doors are barred ... FIRMIN:
We make certain
our men are there ... RAOUL:
We make certain
they're armed ... ANDRE/FIRMIN/RAOUL:
The curtain falls.
His reign will end! GIRY:
Madness! ANDRE:
I'm not so sure ... FIRMIN:
Not if it works ... GIRY:
This is madness! ANDRE:
The tide will turn! GIRY:
Monsieur, believe me -
there is no way of
turning the tide! FIRMIN:
You stick to ballet! RAOUL:
Then help us! GIRY:
Monsieur, I can't ... RAOUL:
Instead of warning us ... RAOUL/ANDRE/FIRMIN:
Help us! GIRY:
I wish I could ... RAOUL/ANDRE/FIRMIN:
Don't make excuses! RAOUL:
Or could it be that
you're on his side? GIRY:
Monsieur, believe me,
I intend no ill ...
But messieurs, be careful -
we have seen him kill ... ANDRE/FIRMIN:
We say he'll fall
and fall he will! CARLOTTA:
She's the one behind this!
Christine!
This is a ploy to help,
Christine! PIANGI:
This is the truth!
Christine Daae! RAOUL:
This is his undoing! ANDRE/FIRMIN:
If you succeed
you free us all -
this so called "angel"
has to fall! RAOUL:
Angel of music,
fear my fury -
Here is where you fall! GIRY:
Hear my warning!
Fear his fury! CARLOTTA:
What glory can
she hope to gain?
It's clear to all
the girl's insane! ANDRE:
Christine sings
We'll get our man ... PIANGI:
She is crazy!
She is raving! FIRMIN:
If Christine helps
us in this plan ... RAOUL:
Say your prayers,
black angel of death! CHRISTINE:
Please don't ANDRE:
...If Christine won't,
then no-one can ... GIRY:
Monsieur, I beg you,
do not do this ... PIANGI/CARLOTTA:
Gran Dio!
Che imbroglio ANDRE/FIRMIN:
This will seal his fate! CHRISTINE:
If you don't stop,
I'll go mad!
Raoul, I'm frightened -
don't make me do this ...
Raoul, it scares me -
don't put me through this
ordeal by fire ...
he'll take me, I know ...
we'll be parted for ever ...
he won't let me go ...
What I once used to dream
I now dread ...
if he finds me, it won't
ever end ...
and he'll always be there,
singing songs in my head ...
he'll always be there,
singing songs in my head ... CARLOTTA:
She's mad ... RAOUL:
You said yourself
he was nothing
but a man ...
Yet while he lives,
he will haunt us
till we're dead ... CHRISTINE:
Twisted every way,
what answer can I give?
Am I to risk my life,
to win the chance to live?
Can I betray the man
who once inspired my voice?
Do I become his prey?
Do I have any choice?
He kills without a thought,
he murders all that's good . . .
I know I can't refuse
and yet, I wish I could . . .
Oh God - if I agree,
what horrors wait for me
in this, the Phantom's opera . . .? RAOUL:
Christine, Christine,
don't think that I don't care -
but every hope
and every prayer
rests on you now . . .
RAOUL:
So, it is to be war between us! But this time, clever
friend, the disaster will be yours! CHORUS :
Hide our sword now wounded knight!
Your vainglorious gasconnade
brought you to your final fight
for your pride, high price you've paid! CHRISTINE:
Silken couch and hay-filled barn
both have been his battlefield. PIANGI:
Those who tangle with Don Juan . . . REYER:
No, no, no! Please.
Don Juan, Signor Piangi - here is the phrase. "Those who tangle with Don Juan . . ."
If you please?
PIANGI:
Those who tangle with Don Juan . . .
REYER:
No, no. Nearly - but no.
"Those who tan, tan, tan . . ."
PIANGI:
Those who tangle with Don Juan . . .
CARLOTTA:
His way is better. At least he make it sound like
music!
GIRY:
Signora - would you speak that way in the
presence of the composer?
CARLOTTA:
The composer is not here. And if he were here, I
would . . .
GIRY:
Are you certain of that, Signora . . .?
REYER:
So, once again - after seven.
Five, six, seven . . .
PIANGI:
Those who tangle with Don Juan . . .
CARLOTTA :
Ah, piu non posso! What does it matter what notes
we sing?
GIRY:
Have patience, Signora.
CARLOTTA:
No-one will know if it is right or if it is wrong.
CARLOTTA:
Those who tangle
with Don Juan!
PIANGI:
Those who tan . . . tan . . .
Is right?
CHRISTINE:
Not quite, Signor:
Those who tan . . . tan . . .
REYER:
Ladies . . . Signor Piangi . . . if you please . . . ALL EXCEPT CHRISTINE:
Poor young maiden! For the thrill
on your tongue of stolen sweets
you will have to pay the bill -
tangled in the winding sheets! CHRISTINE:
In sleep
he sang to me,
in dreams
he came . . .
that voice
which calls to me
and speaks
my name . . . Little Lotte
thought of everything and nothing . . .
Her Father promised her
that he would send her the Angel of Music . . .
Her father promised her . . .
Her father promised her [Raoul - spoken]
Miss Giry, he's not Mephistopheles you know
When it comes down to it, he's just another circus freak
I'm not afraid of him
[Phantom]
Not afraid of me you say?
[Raoul]
Stay back, or I'll kill you, I promise
[Phantom]
Insolent boy
You think you own more of a soul than I do?
[Raoul]
She is my wife
Your music may speak to her
But her heart will always follow me [Phantom]
You think so?
You really think so?
Follow you?
With all your... "charms"?
(Singing)
Look at you, deep in debt
Stinking drunk, pitiful
Shall we two make a bet?
Devil take the hindmost [Raoul]
Look at you, foul as sin
Hideous, horrible
Call the stakes, deal me in
Devil take the hindmost [Phantom]
Our Christine shall choose tonight
(Let her choose)
Is she yours or mine?
(Draw the line) If she sings, you lose tonight
(I won't lose)
You leave from here
(Fine)
Disappear
(Fine) [Raoul]
And if she won't, if I win [Phantom]
All your debt's wiped away [Raoul]
Very well, let's begin [Together]
Devil take the hindmost You think you have the odds
(Our old game)
You think you're in control
(It's been changed) You think you've fixed the dice
(Every throw)
Well, I will gladly roll
(Riskier) I'll bet against the house
(All the rules)
I'll even double down
(Rearranged)
Fortune's on my side
(Fate has redesigned most) I won her long ago
(Cut the deck)
I won her from you then
(Let us play) I'll beat you even now
(You and I )
I'll win her back again
(Once again) (In the end)
And when the game is done
(Either way) [Together]
Devil take the hindmost Now Christine shall choose at last
Is she yours or mine? [Raoul]
We've a son, our bond's secure [Phantom]
Are you sure? [Raoul]
What? [Phantom]
Are you so sure? [Raoul]
What do you mean? [Phantom]
Such a child, strange to see, talented, musical [Raoul]
Huh? [Phantom]
Is he more you or me?
Which one do you find most? [Together]
You lie
(Yet you doubt)
No woman could
(Doubt your wife)
Or ever would
(Doubt your son)
Love such a man
(Everything)
You're insane
(Doubt your life) Now we play, for your life
(So now I play for my life)
Devil take the hindmost
Deal the cards
(I call your bluff)
Let them fall
(The game is on) Choose your hand
(And we will see)
Try your best
(Who wins out) He who wins
(Once and for all)
Wins it all
Devil take the hindmost [Phantom]
She walks, you leave together
Pockets full, debts paid
She sings, you leave alone
Devil take the hindmost [Raoul]
Dear God
What have I done?
I could lose her forever
My Christine! Meg: Tell me, did you watch? Tell me that you saw
Did you hear the crowd, the way they cheered, I hope you're proud
Did you like the new routine? Was it passable, I mean
I can change a thing or two, what should I do?
No, don't say it, I can guess, but I promise I'll progress The Phantom: Yes, of course. Whatever you feel is best Meg: Did the costume look okay? Too revealing, would you say?
People seemed to like the view Madame Giry: Meg, please... Meg: I could show a bit more skin, that would sure bring 'em in -- Madame Giry: Meg! Can't you see that the master's at work?
Can't you see that his mind's somewhere else?
Can't you see that obviously he's thinking of things more important than you? The Phantom: Careful, Madame. You're forgetting yourself. Madame Giry: Don't you see he forgot what this is?
Opening day, a big deal, what a fuss
Our success means not I guess compared to the things that the Master must do! The Phantom: That's quite enough! Madame Giry: Christine! Christine. Meg: Christine... Madame Giry: Meg, leave. Now!
In Paris, when the mob surrounded you, who was there? We were there.
Where was she when the low men hounded you? Gone, long gone. We stayed on.
Who concealed you safe away? Smuggled you up to Calet? Found a freighter out of France? The Phantom: I don't see the problem. This is ancient history. Madame Giry: And once here, when the side show hired you, who stood by? Meg and I
While they kept you on display, who kept working night and day?
Who gave you their very lives?
And who helped you buy that side show?
Who helped you finance you scheme? Who wouldn't quit 'till your act was a hit?
And your hit could become your dream?
Who played the politicians, lured investors and the press? No, not her
And who stayed with you, helped you and advised you?
We stayed with you, loved and idolized you
She betrayed you, shunned you and despised you!
She chose Raoul, chose his beauty and youth.
It's long past time you faced -- The Phantom: Enough! You'll be repaid as I promised you would. Now, if you've anything else left to say Oh Christine, my Christine, yes you've fled from my face once before
But Christine, what we shared, even you can't ignore!
My Christine, I'll be no longer denied; I'll have you back by my side, my sweet Christine!
And come what may, I swear, somehow, some way, I will hear you sing once more! Night time, sharpens, heightens each sensation,
Darkness stirs, and wakes imagination,
Silently the senses, abandon their defenses, Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender,
Slowly, gently night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender
Turn you face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before Softly, deftly, music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it, secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me Floating, falling, sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savor each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music of the night You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night Once upon another time
Our story had only begun
You chose to turn the page
And I made choices too Once upon that other time
We did what we thought must be done
And now we have no choice
We do what we must do We love, we live
We give what we can give
And take what little we deserve Once upon another time
I knew how our story would end
And maybe I was wrong
But now the moment's gone Were it still that other time
I'd make time itself somehow bend
But now I'm not that strong
And time keeps moving on We love, we live
We give what we can give
And take what little we deserve We love, we live
We give what we can give
And take what little we deserve Once upon another time They don't want me any more
They all say I'm through
Well it's time they knew With on look
I can break your heart
With one look
I play every part
I can make your sad heart sing
With one look you'll know
All you need to know With one smile
I'm the girl next door
Or the love that you've hungered for
When I speak it's with my soul
I can play any role No words can tell
The stories my eyes tell
Watch me when I frown
You can't write that down
You know I'm right
It's there in black and white
When I look your way
You'll hear what I say Yes, with one look
I put words to shame
Just one look
Sets the screen aflame
Silent music starts to play
One tear from my eye
Makes the whole world cry With one look
They'll forgive the past
They'll rejoice: I've returned at last
To my people in the dark
Still out there in the dark Silent music starts to play
With one look you'll know
All you need to know With one look
I'll ignite a blaze
I'll return to my glory days
They'll say Norma's back at last This time I'm staying
I'm staying for good
I'll be back
Where I was born to be
With one look
I'll be me Have you ever yearned to go
Past the world you think you know?
Been enthralled to the call
Of the beauty underneath? Have you let it draw you in
Past the place where dreams begin?
Felt the full breathless pull
Of the beauty underneath? When the dark unfolds its wings
Do you sense the strangest things?
Things no one would ever guess
Things mere words cannot express? Yes Do you find yourself beguiled
By the dangerous and wild?
Do you feed on the need
For the beauty underneath? Have you felt your senses surge
And surrendered to the urge?
Have been hooked as you looked at the
At the beauty underneath? When you stare behind the night
Can you glimpse its primal might?
Might you hunger to possess
Hunger that you can't repress? Yes
It seems so beautiful
So strange yet beautiful
Everything's just as you say And he's so beautiful
Perhaps too beautiful
What I suspect cannot be
And yet somehow, we both see
The very same way Is the music in your head
Have you followed where it led?
And been graced with a taste
Of the beauty underneath? Does it fill your every sense
Is it terribly intense?
Tell me you need it too
Need the beauty underneath When it lifts its voice and sings
Don't you feel amazing things?
Things you know you can't confess
Things you thirst for nonetheless It all so beautiful
Can it be?
Almost too beautiful
Do you see what I see? To him it's beautiful
My world is beautiful
How can this be what it seems?
All of my most secret dreams
Somehow set free You can feel the lift
(Yes)
Come closer
(Yes)
You've no fear of the beauty underneath You can face it
(Yes)
You can take it
(Yes)
You see through to the beauty underneath To the splendor
(Splendor)
And the glory
(And the glory)
To the truth of the beauty underneath
(The beauty underneath) You'll accept it
(Yes)
You'll embrace it
(Yes)
Let me show you the beauty underneath To the splendor
(Splendor)
And the glory
(And the glory)
To the truth of the beauty underneath
(The beauty underneath) You'll accept it
(Yes)
You'll embrace it
(Yes)
Let me show you the beauty under Monsieur Andre! Monsieur Firmin!
Dear Andre, what a splendid party
The prelude to a bright new year
Quite a night, I'm impressed Well, one does one's best
Here's to us
The toast for the city
What a pity that the Phantom can't be here Masquerade! Paper faces on parade
Masquerade! Hide your face so the world will never find you
Masquerade! Every face a different shade
Masquerade! Look around, there's another mask behind you Flash of mauve, splash of puce
Fool and king, ghoul and goose
Green and black, queen and priest
Trace of rouge, face of beast, faces Take your turn, take a ride
On the merry-go-round in an inhuman race
Eye of gold, true is false
Who is who? Curl of lip, swirl of gown
Ace of hearts, face of clown, faces
Drink it in, drink it up till you've drowned
In the light, in the sound but who can name the face? Masquerade! Grinning yellows, spinning reds
Masquerade! Take your fill, let the spectacle astound you
Masquerade! Burning glances, turning heads
Masquerade! Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you Masquerade! Seething shadows breathing lies
Masquerade! You can fool any friend who ever knew you
Masquerade! Leering satyrs, peering eyes
Masquerade! Run and hide, but a face will still pursue you What a night! What a crowd!
Makes you glad
Makes you proud
All the crème, de la crème Watching us, watching them
All our fears are in the past
Three months of relief
Of delight, of Elysian peace And we can breathe at last
No more notes, no more ghost
Here's a health, here's a toast
To a prosperous year To our friends who are here
And may the splendor never fade
What a blessed release
And what a masquerade Think of it, a secret engagement
Look, your future bride, just think of it
But, why is it secret? What have we to hide?
You promised me, no, Raoul, please don't, they'll see
Well then let them see, it's an engagement, not a crime Christine, what are you afraid of?
Let's not argue
(Let's not argue)
Please pretend
(I can only hope)
You will understand in time
(I'll understand in time) Masquerade! Paper faces on parade
Masquerade! Hide your face so the world will never find you
Masquerade! Every face a different shade
Masquerade! Look around, there's another mask behind you Masquerade! Burning glances, turning heads
Masquerade! Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you Masquerade!
Grinning yellows, spinning reds
Masquerade! Take your fill, let the spectacle astound you Sure I came out here to make my name
Wanted my pool my dose of fame
Wanted my parking space at Warners
But after a year Of one room hell
A Murphy bell
A rancid smell
Wallpaper peeling at the corners Sunset Boulevard
Twisting boulevard
Secret of the rich
A little scary
Sunset Boulevard
Tempting boulevard
Waiting there to swallow the unwary Dreams are not enough to win a war
Out here they're always keeping score
Beneath the tan
The battle rages
Smile a rented smile Fill someone's glass
Kiss someone's wife
Kiss someone's ass
We do whatever pays the wages Sunset Boulevard
Headline boulevard
Getting here is only the beginning
Sunset Boulevard
Jackpot boulevard
Once you've won, you have to go on winning You think I've sold out
Damn right I've sold out
I've just been waiting
For the right offer Comfortable quarters
Regular rations
Twenty four hour
Five star room service And if I'm honest
I like the lady
I can't help being
Touched by her folly I'm treading water
Taking her money
Watching her sun set
Well I'm a writer LA's changed a lot over the years
Since those brave goldrush pioneers
Came in their creaky covered wagons
Far as they could go
End of the line Their dreams were yours
Their dreams were mine
But in those dreams
Were hidden dragons Sunset Boulevard
Frenzied boulevard
Swamped with every kind of false emotion
Sunset Boulevard
Brutal boulevard
Just like you we'll wind up in the ocean She was sinking fast
I threw a rope
Now I have suits
And she is hope
It seemed an elegant solution One day this must end
It isn't real
Still I'll enjoy a hearty meal
Before tomorrow's execution Sunset Boulevard
Ruthless boulevard
Destination for the stony hearted
Sunset Boulevard
Lethal boulevard
Everyone's forgotten how they started
Here on Sunset Boulevard Don't know why I'm frightened
I know my way around here
The cardboard trees, the painted scenes, the sound here
Yes a world to rediscover
But I'm not in any hurry
And I need a moment The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways
The atmosphere as thrilling here as always
Feel the early morning madness
Feel the magic in the making
Why everything's as if we never said goodbye I've spent so many mornings
Just trying to resist you
I'm trembling now
You can't know how I've missed you
Missed the fairy-tail adventures
In this ever-spinning playground
We were young together I'm coming out of make-up
The lights already burning
Not long until the camera's will start turning
And the early morning madness
And the magic in the making
Yes, everything is as if we never said goodbye I don't want to be alone that's all in the past
This world's waited long enough
I've come home at last And this time will be bigger
And brighter than we knew it
So watch me fly, we all know I can do it
Could I stop my hand from shaking?
Has there ever been a moment with so much to live for? The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways
So much to say not just today but always
We'll have early morning madness
We'll have magic in the making
Yes, everything is as if we never said goodbye
Oh, please don't ever ever make me say goodbye Pie Jesu

Requiem In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name
And do I dream again?
For now I find
The phantom of the opera is there
Inside my mind Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you
Grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me
To glance behind
The phantom of the opera is here
Inside your mind Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear
It's me they hear My spirit and my voice
In one combined
The phantom of the opera is there
Inside my mind In all your fantasies you always knew
That man and mystery were both in you
And in this labyrinth
Where night is blind
The phantom of the opera is here
Inside my mind He's there
The phantom of the opera 5, 6, a-5, 6, 7, 8
Bathing beauty, on the beach
Bathing beauty, say hello
What a cutie, what a peach
Bathing beauty, watch her go
(Alright, Meg, take 5, girls, take it one more time)
Bathing beauty, on the beach Very nice, Meg
Do you think so, mother, really?
You've come a long way since the beginning of the season
Does he agree?
It's been three months, he never comes to see the show
Even a word from him, just one You may get more than that
He has been composing again, late at night
Not this cheap Vaudeville trash, something glorious
For, for me?
Continue to work hard
Make yourself useful to him Mother
Patience, Gustave, first I must find the stage manager
My dressing room, the musical director
Then we'll go look for our friend and go see the island?
I'm sure he'll send for you when he's ready
Well, excuse me, miss, would you mind? Heaven help me, could it be?
No, it couldn't possibly
Sorry, do I?
Yes, I think you do Have we?
Go on, take a guess
Wait, it can't be, is it?
Yes

You look the same My sweet old friend
Never thought we'd meet, old friend
Look at you, a star
And you, a wife And isn't life a splendid thing?
And here we are
To see the sights
And sing To sing?
And of course, as a treat for my son
Meg, meet Gustave
Who hired you to sing here? You
It can't be you
Is this a jest?
How can this be? We've come to work
At whose request?
The contract's here
I want to see My God, the price
It's rather high
Why, it's absurd
Oh, yes, I know Inform your boss
That by the by
The fee goes up
Or else we go My dear old friend
Here's how things appear, old friend
He who pays the bill
Times two or three
Be sure he will
And handsomely And dear old friend
Now that we are clear, old friend
That's all very well but till you're gone
You'll wait upon my boss' whim
Ah, yes, your boss and who is that?
It's him Sorry, did I hear you right?
Here to sing
Tomorrow night?
I'm afraid there must be some mistake You can't be performing
Why?
Mainly, dear 'cause so am I
I'm in fact the star, for heaven's sake What are you to sing?
Just one little thing, an aria
Please you needn't fret
I'm sure you will get your due Him?
That's what I said
You work for him?
Now so do you And my poor wife
We thought him dead
She'll be appalled
Unless she knew Darling, please, are you alright?
(Tell me now, that music, who was its creator?)
Darling, please don't squeeze so tight
(Something's going on here, I'll deal with you later) Did you know?
How could I know
Why would they come?
Why won't they go? My dear old friend
Can't believe you're here, old friend
Speaking as your host
As an artist
What a surprise
To say the least Yes, dear old friend
That's a happy tear, old friend
I can't conceal, try though I may
The way I feel so I pretend
I'm sure it's clear
To such a dear old friend You mustn't stay
Why would I leave?
Why are we here?
Don't play naive What dear old friends
Don't we all live here, old friends?
Nothing has been changed
And never will
Just rearranged
And yet we're still Such grand old friends
Such devoted and old friends
Words cannot suggest
What's in my heart
And for the rest
Why even start? My dear old friends
So much longer near, old friends
Back again at last
When everyone
Is doing great
Won't this be fun? With dear old friends
Utterly sincere old friends

Old friend Gustave, Gustave, Gustave?
Must we always be chasing after the boy?

No, I will look for him Break's over, Meg, back to work
A-5, 6, 7, 8
Bathing beauty, on the beach
Bathing beauty, say hello
What a cutie, what a peach
Bathing beauty, watch her go Do you remember the good years in Canaan?
The summers were endlessly gold
The fields were a patchwork of clover
The winters were never too cold We'd stroll down the boulevards together
And everything round us was fine
Now the fields are dead and bare
No joie de vivre anywhere
Et maintenant we drink a bitter wine Those Canaan days we used to know
Where have they gone, where did they go?
Eh bien, raise your berets to those Canaan days Do you remember those wonderful parties?
The splendor of Canaan's cuisine
Our extravagant, elegant soirees
The gayest the Bible has seen It's funny but since we lost Joseph
We've gone to the other extreme
No one comes to dinner now, we'd only eat them anyhow
I even find I'm missing Joseph's dreams Those Canaan days we used to know
Where have they gone, where did they go?
Eh bien, raise your berets to those Canaan days It's funny but since we lost Joseph
We've gone to the other extreme
Perhaps we all misjudged the lad
Perhaps he wasn't quite that bad
And how we miss his entertaining dreams Those Canaan days we used to know
Where have they gone, where did they go?
Eh bien, raise your berets to those Canaan days
Eh bien, raise your berets to those Canaan days One more
Oh, buddy, don't you think you've had enough?
It's practically morning already
One more, I said
Alright, alright My shift is over anyway, so let's settle the bill, okay?
Jeez, you're in a bad way ain't you?
Worse than most that end up here
Here's the morning shift, maybe he'll know what to do with you Yes, what to do with me
That's the question, isn't it?
That's always been the question
Ever since the beginning She looks for sympathy
I give her sorrow
She asks for honesty
I've none to borrow She needs my tender kiss
She begs it off me
I give her ugliness
Why does she love me? She yearns for higher things
Things I can't give her
The rush that music brings
I can't deliver And even when she sings
And soars above me
I try to clip her wings
Why does she love me? One more drink, sir
That's what I need
Don't you think, sir?
Leave the hurt behind Do you hear me?
Another drink She wants the man I was
Husband and father
At least, she thinks she does
She needn't bother Beneath this mask I wear
There's nothing of me
Just horror, shame, despair
Why does she love me? How 'bout you, sir?
Tell me what am I to do, sir?
Leave the hurt behind Morning, Bernie, coffee please
Hurry up before I freeze
I'll just take it black Mother said, I'd find you here
Miss Giry
Do you know where you are?
Hell, I imagine Around here they call it suicide hall
It's where people end up
When they don't know where else to go The hopeless, the desperate
The good place to step off the side
Of the pier and quietly vanish
You seem to be a regular
Me?
I come here to swim This town is coarse and cold and mean
It's hard to keep your conscience clean
Faceless in the crowd
Anything's allowed And so I come at dawn each day
Come to wash it all away
Sink into the sea, blue and cool and kind
Let it set me free, let the past unwind
Leave the hurt behind You should never have come to America
It's not a place for people like you and Christine
It's too easy to forget who you are and where you belong
That's why Mother says you must leave here
Now, take your wife and the boy and go Leave?
What about tonight?
The concert, the money?
Am I to just run away from him?
When the sun rises tomorrow
We can all start again, clean Sail across the sea
Put us out of mind
Close your eyes and flee
Let yourself stay blind
Leave this place behind Passarino - go away!
For the trap is set and waits for
Its prey! You have come here
In pursuit of
Your deepest urge,
In pursuit of
That wish,
Which till now
Has been silent,
Silent... I have brought you,
That our passions
May fuse and merge -
In your mind
You've already
Succumbed to me,
Dropped all defences,
Completely succumbed to me -
Now you are here with me:
No second thoughts,
You've decided,
Decided... Past the point
Of no return -
No backward glances:
The games we've played
Till now are at
An end...
Past all thought
Of "if" or "when" -
No use resisting:
Abandon thought
And let the dream
Descend... What raging fire
Shall flood the soul?
Which rich desire
Unlocks its door?
What sweet seduction
Lies before
Us...? Past the point
Of no return,
The final threshold -
What warm,
Unspoken secrets
Will we learn?
Beyond the point
Of no return... CHRISTINE
You have brought me
To that moment
Where words run dry,
To that moment
Where speech
Disappears
Into silence,
Silence... I have come here,
Hardly knowing
The reason why...
In my mind,
I've already
Imagined our
Bodies entwining,
Defenceless and silent -
And now I am
Here with you:
No second thoughts, I've decided,
Decided... Past the point
Of no return -
No going back now:
Our passion-play
Has now, at last
Begun...
Past all thought
Of right or wrong -
One final question:
How long should we
Two wait, before
We're one...? When will the blood
Begin to race,
The sleeping bud
Burst into bloom?
When will the flames,
At last consume
Us...? BOTH
Past the point
Of no return,
The final threshold -
The bridge
Is crossed, so stand
And watch it burn...
We've passed the point
Of no return... PHANTOM
Say you'll share with
Me one
Love, one lifetime...
Lead me, save me
From my solitude... Say you want me
With you,
Here beside you...
Anywhere you go
Let me go too -
Christine,
That's all I ask of... CARLOTTA
(spoken)
What is it? What has happened? Ubaldo! ANDRÉ
(spoken)
Oh, my God...my God... FIRMIN
(spoken)
We're ruined, André - ruined! GIRY
(spoken)
Monsieur le Vicomte! Come with me! CARLOTTA
(spoken)
Oh my darling, my darling...who has
Done this...? You! Why did you let this happen? GIRY
(spoken)
Monsieur le Vicomte, I know where they
Are. RAOUL
(spoken)
But can I trust you? GIRY
(spoken)
You must. But remember: your hand at
The level of your eyes! RAOUL
(spoken)
But why...? GIRY
(spoken)
Why? The Punjab lasso, monsieur. First
Buquet. Now Piangi. MEG
(spoken)
Like this, monsieur. I'll come with you. GIRY
(spoken)
No, Meg! No, you stay here! Come with me, monsieur. Hurry, or we
Shall be too late You were once
My one companion
You were all
That mattered
You were once
A friend and father
Then my world
Was shattered Wishing you were
Somehow here again
Wishing you were
Somehow near
Sometimes it seemed
If I just dreamed,
Somehow you would
Be here Wishing I could
Hear your voice again
Knowing that I
Never would
Dreaming of you
Won't help me to do
All that you dreamed
I could Passing bells
And sculpted angels,
Cold and monumental,
Seem, for you,
The wrong companions
You were warm and gentle Too many years
Fighting back tears
Why can't the past
Just die? Wishing you were
Somehow here again
Knowing we must
Say goodbye
Try to forgive
Teach me to live
Give me the strength
To try No more memories,
No more silent tears
No more gazing across
The wasted years
Help me say
Goodbye Pharaoh, he was a powerful man
With the ancient world in the palm of his hand
To all intents and purposes, he was Egypt with a capital E
Whatever he did he was showered with praise If he cracked a joke then you chortled for days
No one had rights or a vote but the king
In fact you might say he was fairly right wing
When Pharaoh's around, then you get down on the ground
If you ever find yourself near Ramses, get down on your knees A Pharaoh story, a Pharaoh story Down at the other end of the scale
Joseph is still doing time in jail
For even though he is in with the guards
A lifetime in prison seems quite on the cards
But if my analysis of the position is right At the end of the tunnel there's a glimmer of light
For all of a sudden indescribable things
Have shattered the sleep of both peasants and kings
Strange as it seems, there's been a run of crazy dreams
And a man who can interpret could go far, could become a star Could be famous, could be a big success Could be a star Ladies and gentleman
Mr.Y is pleased to present to you
His final surprise of the season
A command performance by Christine Daae
The most heavenly diva of this or any age But first, for those of you
Whose taste is a little more earth-bound
The sweet-heart of the midway
The Oolala Girl
The incomparable
Meg Giry I took a little trip to Coney Island
To get away from all the city sprawl
I couldn't bear to choose which bathing suit to use
So goodness me, I guess I brought 'em all But when at last I got to Coney Island
And found myself a spot upon the sand
I noticed something strange, there was no place to change
Uh, oh
And so I asked my friends to lend a hand Girls
Aah, ooh
Bathing beauty
Take a look at you Bathing beauty on the beach
Bathing beauty, say hello
What a cutie, what a peach
Bathing beauty, watch her go Posing under her parasol
She is what you call a real spectacle
Prim and proper with classic poise
But she's got the boys at the plaque to call Bathing beauty on the beach
See her practically glow
Wearing the smile and hitting Coney Island
Bathing beauty of a show Bathing beauty on the beach
Stripes
Ooh, what a cutie, what a peach
Spots Ooh, bathing beauty, bathing beauty
Checks, checks
Checks, checks, checks, checks
Oops Bathing beauty on the beach
See her practically glow
Taking the sun and see all the boys are running
Go and unclothe her and get a tan all over Wearing a smile and hitting Coney Island
The bathing beauty of our show
Bathing beauty, say hello Ladies and Gentlemen, these were the very, the 'Oohlala Girls'
In just a moment, Christine Daa
The worlds most celebrated
Will be making her American debut her at Phantasma
But first, performing fist, of miraculous, muscular strength
The mighty Ring out the old
Bring in the new
A midnight wish to share with you
Your lips are warm, my head is light
Were we in love before tonight? I don't need a crowded ballroom
Everything I need is here, if you're with me
Next year will be the perfect year No need to hear the music play
Your eyes say all there is to say
The stars can fade
And they can shine
Long as your face is next to mine I don't need a crowded ballroom
Everything I need is here, if you're with me
Next year will be the perfect year We don't need a crowded ballroom
Everything I need is here, if you're with me
Next year will be the perfect year It's New Year's Eve, and hopes are high
Dance one year in, kiss one goodbye
Another chance, another start
So many dreams to tease the heart We don't need a crowded ballroom
Everything I need is here, if you're with me
Next year will be the perfect year Bravi, bravi, bravissimi! Where in the world
Have you been hiding?
Really - you were perfect
I only wish
I knew your secret
Who is this new
Tutor? Father once spoke of an angel
I used to dream he'd appear
Now as I sing I can sense him
And I know he's here Here in this room he calls me softly
Somewhere inside, hiding
Somehow I know he's always with me
He, the unseen genius Christine, Christine you must have been dreaming
Stories like this can't come true
Christine, you're talking in riddles
And it's not like you Angel of music, guide and guardian
Grant to me your glory Who is this angel?
This Angel of music, hide no longer
Secret and strange angel He's with me even now Your hands are cold All around me Your face, Christine, it's white It frightens me Don't be frightened Please, Miss Giry
I want to go back
I want my mother The world is hard
The world is mean
It's hard to keep
Your conscience clean Please, you're hurting me The sea is calm
The sea is gray
It washes
Everything away I can't swim
Don't worry, it's almost over Sink into the deep
Blue and cool and kind
Then drift off to sleep
Let the past unwind
Leave the hurt behind Gustave
Mother
No, I'm not done yet Let go of the boy now
Not another step
Let go of him, girl, or I promise you
Not another word Always wondered
How to make you watch
Well, watch me now I took a little trip to Coney Island
I took a little trip because of you
I did as Mother said and followed where you led
And tried to do what little I could do Well, here's the way it works on Coney Island
They make you pay for every little crumb
I gave what they would take, I gave it for your sake
Now look at me and see what I've become Bathing beauty on the beach
Bathing beauty in her dressing room
Bathing beauty in the dark
On their laps, in their arms, in their beds Meg, my little Meg
What are you saying? Who helped you raise the money?
Who helped the permits come through?
Who greased the wheels of your high flying deals
Bought you time when the bills came due? Who swayed the local bosses
Curried favor with the press?
No, not her
And who kept singing, desperate for your favor
Who kept dancing, hoping you would save her
Who kept dying and this is what you gave her Now that I've got your attention at last
Here's the big finish and then you can go Give me the gun, Meg
Give me the hurt and the pain and the gun, Meg
Give me the blame for not seeing the things
That you've done, Meg Give me the gun, Meg
Give me the chance to see you clear at last
See me clear at last
You feel ugly, you feel used
You feel broken, you feel bruised Ah, but me, I can see all the beauty underneath
Yes
You've been robbed of love and pride
Been ignored and pushed aside
Even so, I still know there is beauty underneath
Yes Diamonds never sparkle right
If they aren't set just right
Beauty sometimes goes unseen
We can't all be like Christine Christine, Christine
Always Christine No, I didn't mean to
Mother, there, say something
Say anything
Giry, go get help, now Where's Papa?
He should be here
Where's Papa?
Your father, your real father Look with your heart and not with your eyes
The heart understands, the heart never lies
Believe what it feels and trust what it shows
Look with your heart, the heart always knows Love is not always beautiful
Not at the start
So open your arms
And close your eyes tight
Look with your heart
And when you find love No Once upon another time, our story had only begun
I had a taste of joy, the most I ever knew
Now there isn't any time and somehow our story is done
And what about the boy, what am I to do? Just love, just live
And give what we can give
And take the love that you deserve
Just love, just live
And give all that I have
And take what little I deserve Come closer, I beg you
Closer still
Remember love never dies
Kiss me one last time Close every door to me
Hide all the world from me
Bar all the windows
And shut out the light
Do what you want with me
Hate me and laugh at me
Darken my daytime
And torture my night
If my life were important I
Would ask will I live or die
But I know the answers lie
Far from this world Close every door to me
Keep those I love from me
Children of Israel
Are never alone
For I know I shall find
My own peace of mind
For I have been promised
A land of my own Close every door to me
Hide all the world from me
Bar all the windows
And shut out the light Just give me a number
Instead of my name
Forget all about me
And let me decay
I do not matter
I'm only one person
Destroy me completely
Then throw me away If my life were important I
Would ask will I live or die
But I know the answers lie
Far from this world Close every door to me
Keep those I love from me
Children of Israel
Are never alone
For we know we shall find
Our own peace of mind
For we have been promised
A land of our own *RAOUL*
Little Lotte let her mind wander
Little Lotte thought
Am I fonder of dolls or of goblins or shoes *CHRISTINE*
Raoul *RAOUL*
(laughs)
Or of riddles or frocks *CHRISTINE*
Those picnics in the attic *RAOUL*
Or of chocolates *CHRISTINE*
Father playing the violin *RAOUL*
As we read to each other
dark stories of the North *CHRISTINE*
No what I love best Lotte said
is when i'm asleep in my bed
and the angel of music sings songs in my head *BOTH*
The Angel of Music sings songs in my head *RAOUL*
You sang like an angel tonight *CHRISTINE*
Father said when i'm in heaven child
I will send The Angel of Music to you.
Well father is dead Raoul

I am your Angel of music
Come to me Angel of Music Coney isle
Glistening and glimmering
Rising bright
Drenched in light
See it smile
Beckoning and shimmering
All a-gleam
Like a dream
Every fantasy set free
Summer rising by the sea
Wonders and astonishments for your delectation
Phantoms and automatons for your fascination Marvels undreamt since the dawn of creation
Coney isle miracle on miracle
See the sound burning round
Mile by mile
Loud and lewd and lyrical
Dream on dream never seen
Welcome one and welcome all
Welcome to the master's hall
Welcome to the
Welcome to the
Welcome to the Oh, no, not he
How you can accuse him is a mystery?
Save him, take me
Benjamin is straighter than the tall palm tree I hear the steel drums sing their song
They're singing man you know you've got it wrong
I hear the voice of the yellow bird
Singing in the tree it is quite absurd Oh, yes, it's true
Benjamin is straighter than the big bamboo
No ifs, no buts
Benjamin is honest as coconuts Sure as the tide wash the golden sand
Benjamin is an innocent man
Sure as bananas need the sun
We are the criminal guilty ones Oh, no, not he
How you can accuse him is a mystery?
Save him, take me
Benjamin is straighter than the tall palm tree
La la, la la, la la, la la Oh, no, not he
How you can accuse him is a mystery?
Save him, take me
Benjamin is straighter than the tall palm tree Sure as the tide wash the golden sand
Benjamin is an innocent man
Sure as bananas need the sun
We are the criminal guilty ones Oh, no, not he
How you can accuse him is a mystery?
Save him, take me
Benjamin is straighter than the tall palm tree Oh no, not he
How you can accuse him is a mystery?
Save him, take me
La la, la la, la la, la la Gustave, it's alright, it's me
Gustave, please take him away
I'm so sorry
Please forgive him, he meant no harm How could you think I wouldn't guess?
What do you mean?
How could you think I wouldn't know?
Oh, no Do you have something to confess?
Please don't make me
I want the truth right now, if so Once upon another time
You went off and left me alone
But that's not all you did
You left me with a son Ever since that other time
I wished, how I wished you'd have known
I kept the secret hid, the secret my marriage forbid
What else could I have done? Just live
Our son
Just live
My son
Just give what I could give
And take what little I deserve My own flesh and blood
And even he recoils in horror from me
Just like his mother Forgive me, I beg you, if you can
I've brought you nothing but woe
Tomorrow night, I'll sing with all my might
Sing for you again, then we'll go From out of ugliness, such light
From out of darkness, such a flame
In him, my wrongness is made right
And yet he loathes me just the same So let him shun me in disgust
Let him flee this cursed face
If I must hide from him, I must
Yet shall he be my saving grace Oh, Christine, my Christine
If it's true, I've no reason to live
Then, Christine, then our boy
Shall have all I can give Ah, Christine
All I create on this earth
All that I'll never be worth
All shall be his Ten long years and he casts us aside
Ten whole years, this is how we're repaid
Ten dark years of toil and tears
And now what we've worked for will go to that child All our hopes were at last in our grasp
All the dreams and the plans that we laid
Everything is vanishing
And we get discarded, rejected, reviled All of the bonds in between is now torn
All of the love that we gave him was worn
All would be ours
If that bastard had never been born Gustave: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh.
Stage-Hands: Ready on the rail?
Ready on the rail!
Raoul: Will she sing? Will she flee? What is she thinking now? Is it him? Is it me? Devil take the hindmost.
Stage-Hands: Ready on the floor?
Ready on the floor!
Gustave(In the backround): Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh.
Raoul: Will she stay? Will she go?
Phantom: Obey your heart and sing for me! You want it so!
Raoul: Does she know? Even know?
Phantom: Stay and be mine eternally!
Raoul: Please Christine! Stop the show!
Raoul&Phantom;: Devil take the hindmost. Now, it's time so make your choice! Do it for our son! Use your head, no time to wait. Hesitate, we're all undone.
Stage-Hands: Ready in the pit?
Ready in the pit!
[[CHORUS 3X]]
Madam Giry: Perhaps she won't go on.
Phantom: Obey your heart
Raoul: Will she stay? Will she go?
Madam Giry: Perhaps her voice won't serve.
Phantom: And sing for me! And sing for me!
Raoul: Does she know?
Madam: Giry: And she will fail him now
Phantom: You, me, the child.
Raoul: Even now.
Madam Giry: and then my child and I
Phantom: Eternally
Raoul: Please Christine.
Madam Giry: Will get what we deserve!
Raoul: Stop the show!
Madam Giry&Raoul;&Phantom;: Devil take the hindmost!
Madam Giry&Raoul;&Phantom;: Now it's time, no turning back, all is on the line. Here it is, the final dance. One last chance, to get what's mine! Madam Giry: I hope Christine's worthy of you, and I hope her singing makes up for what your blindness has done to Meg and me.
Meg: Devil take the hindmost...
Stage-Hand: And curtian! [Che:]
Tell me before I waltz out of your life
Before turning my back on the past
Forgive my impertinent behavior
But how long do you think this pantomime can last? Tell me before I ride off in the sunset
There's one thing I never got clear
How can you claim you're our savior
When those who oppose you are stepped on
Or cut up, or simply disappear? [Eva:]
Tell me before you get onto your bus
Before joining the forgotten brigade
How can one person like me, say
Alter the time-honored way the game is played? Tell me before you get onto your high horse
Just what you expect me to do
I don't care what the bourgeoisie say
I'm not in business for them
But to give all my descamisados
A magical moment or two [Che and Eva:]
There is evil, ever around
Fundamental system of government
Quite incidental [Eva:]
So what are my chances of honest advances?
I'd say low
Better to win by admitting my sin
Than to lose with a halo [Che:]
Tell me before I seek worthier pastures
And thereby restore self-esteem
How can you be so short-sighted
To look never further than this week or next week
To have no impossible dream? [Eva:]
Allow me to help you slink off to the sidelines
And mark your adieu with three cheers
But first tell me who'd be delighted
If I said I'd take on the world's greatest problems
From war to pollution, no hope of solution
Even if I lived for one hundred years [Che and Eva:]
There is evil, ever around
Fundamental system of government
Quite incidental [Eva:]
So go, if you're able, to somewhere unstable
And stay there
Whip up your hate in some tottering state
But not here, dear
Is that clear, dear? Oh what I'd give for a hundred years
But the physical interferes
Every day more, oh my Creator
What is the good of the strongest heart
In a body that's falling apart?
A serious flaw, I hope you know that Ah, Christine, my Christine
What a triumph you gave me tonight
My Christine
All the dark silent years now set right
Ah, Christine The song was beautiful
It sounded beautiful
Every note, every word And it felt beautiful
And I felt beautiful
Lost in the music once more
Feeling it rise up and soar
Alive once again My dearest wife
Little Lotte, I beg you, forgive me
Raoul, no
Little Lotte
Ah, what fools we once were Long ago in our youth
In Paris at the opera
Romantic idiot
Those two people are gone Now I must go
Our choices are made
The opera is done
The last notes have been played May your angel of music
Watch over you now
And give you what I wish
I gave you somehow Yours, in regret
Raoul Who are you, where are you taking me?
I'm Miss Fleck
The Mighty Squelch
Doctor Gangle
At your service
And his Come along and follow us, come and follow faster
Come along and follow us, come and meet the master
Hurry up and follow us, hurry if you care to
Soon the dark will swallow us, follow if you dare to Is this where Mr. Y lives?
This is where he works
Step lively, child
He is waiting What is this place?
This is my realm, illusion's domain
Where music and beauty and art are first rate
Go look around while I finish my work May I?
Does the young Vicotme play?
What's this?
Just a song I have made
Go on I think it's beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful notes
Beautiful, beautiful sounds
Don't you agree?
It's beautiful This boy
So very beautiful
This music
Music that comes on control He plays like me
Floating and lovely and bold
He's just 10 years old
10 years old
My God, my God [FIRMIN]
"Mystery
after gala night,"
if says, "Mystery
of soprano's flight!"
"Mystified
baffled Surete say,
we are mystified -
we suspect foul play!"
Bad news on
soprano scene -
first Carlotta,
now Christine!
Still, at least
the seats get sold
gossip's worth
its weight in gold . . .
What a way to
run a business!
Spare me these
unending trials!
Half your cast disappears,
but the crowd still cheers!
Opera!
To hell with Gluck and Handel -
It's a scandal that'll
pack 'em in the aisles! [ANDRE]
Damnable!
Will they all walk out?
This is damnable! [FIRMIN]
Andre, please don't shout . . .
It's publicity!
And the take is vast!
Free publicity! [ANDRE]
But we have no cast . . . [FIRMIN (calmly)]
But Andre,
have you seen the queue?
Oh, it seems
you've got one too . . . [ANDRE]
"Dear Andre
what a charming gala!
Christine enjoyed a great success!
We were hardly bereft
when Carlotta left -
otherwise
the chorus was entrancing,
but the dancing was a
lamentable mess!" [FIRMIN (reading his)]
"Dear Firmin,
just a brief reminder:
my salary has not been paid.
Send it care of the ghost,
by return of post
P.T.O.:
No-one likes a debtor,
so it's better if my
orders are obeyed!" [FIRMIN/ANDRE]
Who would have the gall
to send this?
Someone with a puerile brain! [FIRMIN (examining both letters)]
These are both signed "O.G." . . . [ANDRE]
Who the hell is he? [BOTH (immediately realizing)]
Opera ghost! [FIRMIN (unamused)]
It's really not amusing! [ANDRE]
He's abusing
our position! [FIRMIN]
In addition
he wants money! [ANDRE]
He's a funny
sort of spectre . . . [BOTH]
. . . to expect a
large retainer!
Nothing plainer -
he is clearly quite insane! [RAOUL]
Where is she? [ANDRE]
You mean Carlotta? [RAOUL]
I mean Miss Daae -
where is she? [FIRMIN]
Well, how should we know? [RAOUL]
I want an answer -
I take it that you sent me this note? [FIRMIN]
What's all this nonsense? [ANDRE]
Of course not! [FIRMIN]
Don't look at us! [RAOUL]
She's not with you, then? [FIRMIN]
Of course not! [ANDRE]
We're in the dark . . . [RAOUL]
Monsieur, don't argue -
Isn't this the
letter you wrote? [FIRMIN]
And what is it, that we're
meant to have wrote?
(Realizing his mistake)
Written! [ANDRE]
"Do not fear for Miss Daae.
The Angel of Music
has her under his wing.
Make no attempt to see her again." [RAOUL]
If you didn't write it, who did? [CARLOTTA]
Where is he?
[ANDRE]
Ah, welcome back! [CARLOTTA]
Your precious patron -
where is he? [RAOUL]
What is it now? [CARLOTTA (to RAOUL)]
I have your letter -
a letter which I
rather resent! [FIRMIN (to RAOUL)]
And did you send it? [RAOUL]
Of course not! [ANDRE]
As if he would! [CARLOTTA]
You didn't send it? [RAOUL]
Of course not! [FIRMIN]
What's going on . . .? [CARLOTTA (to RAOUL)]
You dare to tell me,
that this is not the
letter you sent?! [RAOUL]
And what is it that I'm
meant to have sent?
(RAOUL takes the letter and reads it)
"Your days
at the Opera Populaire are numbered.
Christine Daae
will be singing on your behalf tonight.
Be prepared
for a great misfortune,
should you attempt
to take her place." [ANDRE/FIRMIN]
Far too many
notes for my taste -
and most of them
about Christine!
All we've heard since we came
is Miss Daae's name . . . [GIRY]
Miss Daae has returned. [FIRMIN (drily)]
I trust her midnight oil
is well and truly burned. [ANDRE]
Where precisely is she now? [GIRY]
I thought it best
that she went home . . . [MEG]
She needed rest. [RAOUL]
May I see her? [GIRY]
No, monsieur,
she will see no-one. [CARLOTTA]
Will she sing?
Will she sing? [GIRY]
Here, I have a note . . . [RAOUL/CARLOTTA/ANDRE]
Let me see it! [FIRMIN (snatching it)]
Please! [FIRMIN (Opens the letter and reads. The PHANTOM'S
voice gradually lakes over)]
"Gentlemen, I have now sent you several notes of the
most amiable nature, detailing how my theatre is to be
run. You have not followed my instructions.
I shall give you one last chance . . ." [PHANTOM'S VOICE (taking over)]
Christine Daae has returned to you,
and I am anxious her career
should progress.
In the new production of "Il Muto",
you will therefore cast Carlotta
as the Pageboy, and put Miss Daae
in the role of Countess.
The role which Miss Daae plays
calls for charm and appeal.
The role of the Pageboy is silent -
which makes my casting,
in a word
ideal.
I shall watch the performance from my normal seat in
Box Five, which will be kept empty for me. Should
these commands be ignored, a disaster beyond your
imagination will occur. [FIRMIN (taking over)]
"I remain, Gentlemen,
Your obedient servant, O.G." [CARLOTTA]
Christine! [ANDRE]
Whatever next . . .? [CARLOTTA]
It's all a ploy to help Christine! [FIRMIN]
This is insane . . . [CARLOTTA]
I know who sent this:
(pointing an accusing finger)
The Vicomte - her lover! [RAOUL (ironical)]
Indeed?
(to the OTHERS)
Can you believe this? [ANDRE (to CARLOTTA, in protest)]
Signora! [CARLOTTA (half to the MANAGERS, half to herself)]
O traditori! [FIRMIN (to CARLOTTA)]
This is a joke! [ANDRE]
This changes nothing! [CARLOTTA]
O mentitori! [FIRMIN]
Signora! [ANDRE]
You are our star! [FIRMIN]
And always will be! [ANDRE]
Signora . . . [FIRMIN]
The man is mad! [ANDRE]
We don't take orders! [FIRMIN (announcing it to EVERYONE)]
Miss Daae will be playing
the Pageboy - the silent role . . . [ANDRE/FIRMIN]
Carlotta will be playing
the lead! [CARLOTTA (waxing melodramatic)]
It's useless trying to
appease me!
You're only saying this
to please me!
Signori, e vero?
Non, non, non voglio udire!
Lasciatemi morire!
O padre mio!
Dio! [GIRY]
Who scorn his word,
beware to those . . . [CARLOTTA (to MANAGERS)]
You have reviled me! [GIRY]
The angel sees,
the angel knows . . . [RAOUL]
Why did Christine
fly from my arms . . .? [CARLOTTA]
You have rebuked me! [ANDRE/FIRMIN]
Signora, pardon us . . . [CARLOTTA]
You have replaced me! [ANDRE/FIRMIN]
Please, Signora,
we beseech you . . . [GIRY]
This hour shall see
your darkest fears . . . [MEG/RAOUL]
I must see her . . . [CARLOTTA]
Abbandonata!
Deseredata!
O, sventurata! [GIRY]
The angel knows,
the angel hears . . . [RAOUL]
Where did she go . . .? [CARLOTTA]
Abbandonata!
Disgraziata! [ANDRE/FIRMIN]
Signora, sing for us!
Don't be a martyr . . . [RAOUL/GIRY/MEG]
What new surprises
lie in store . . .? [ANDRE/FIRMIN]
Our star . . .! [CARLOTTA]
Non vo' cantar! (Che:)
Goodnight and thank you Huevo
She is in every magazine
Been photographed, seen, she is known
We don't like to rush, but your case has been packed
If she's missed anything, you could give her a ring
But she won't always answer the phone (Eva:)
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies
But we have pretended enough
It's best that we both stop fooling ourselves (Che:)
Which means... (Che and Eva:)
There is no one, no one at all
Never has been, and never will be a lover, male or female
Who hasn't an eye on, in fact they rely on
Tricks they can try on their partner
They're hoping their lover will help them or keep them
Support them, promote them
Don't blame them, you're the same (Che:)
Goodnight and thank you Emilio
You've completed your task
What more can we ask of you now?
Please sign the book on the way out the door
And that will be all, if she needs you she'll call
But I don't think that's likely somehow (Eva:)
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies
But when we were hot, we were hot
I know you'll look back on the good times we've shared
Which means ... (substituting "blame her" for "blame
Them", sung only by Che) (Eva:)
There is no soap, no soap like Zaz
No detergent, lotion, or oil with such power in the shower
It's the mother and father of luxury lather
The talk of the bath, the great ointment
One little frolic with new Zaz carbolic
You're scented, you'll be sent (Che:)
Goodnight and thank you Senor Jabon
We are grateful you found her a spot on the sound radio
We'll think of you every time she's on the air
We'd love you to stay but you'd be in the way
So do up your trousers and go (Eva:)
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies
The decline into silence and doubt
Our passion was just too intense to survive (Che:)
Which means ... (Lovers:)
This is a club I should never have joined
Someone has made us look fools
Argentine men call the sexual shots
Someone has altered the rules (Eva:)
Fame on the wireless as far as it goes
Is all very well but every girl knows (Che:)
She needs a man she can monopolize
With fingers in dozens of different pies (Lovers:) Love, love changes everything
Hands and faces, earth and sky
Love, love changes everything
How you live and how you die Love can make the summer fly
Or a night seem like a lifetime
Yes love, love changes everything
Now I tremble at your name
Nothing in the world will ever be the same Love, love changes everything
Days are longer, words mean more
Love, love changes everything
Pain is deeper than before Love will turn your world around
And that world will last for ever
Yes love, love changes everything
Brings you glory, brings you shame
Nothing in the world will ever be the same Off into the world we go
Planning futures, shaping years
Love bursts in and suddenly
All our wisdom disappears Love makes fools of everyone
All the rules we make are broken
Yes love, love changes everyone
Live or perish in its flame
Love will never, never let you be the same Love will never, never let you be the same! Wandering child, so lost, so helpless, yearning for my guidance Angel or father? Friend or phantom? Who is it there, staring? Have you forgotten your Angel? Angel, oh, speak! What endless longings echo in this whisper! Too long you've wandered in winter, far from my fathering gaze Wildly my mind beats against you You resist
Yet the (your) soul obeys Angel of Music! You denied me, turning from true beauty
Angel of Music! Do not shun me! Come to your strange Angel! Angel of Music! I denied you, turning from true beauty
Angel of Music! My protector! Come to me, strange Angel! I am your Angel of Music
Come to me, Angel of Music No, Christine! Wait! Raoul! Whatever you may believe, this man, this thing is not your father! Mother, did you watch?
Everything is sold
Mother, can't you tell the new routine
It went so well? I was worried just a touch
That it might have been too much
Just a bit, well, rather, free But just listen to that crowd
Why, they've never been so loud
Screaming only for me Meg And the master must have heard
Every note and every word
Mother, tell me, did he see? Meg, stop it Even he will now concede
I'm the only he'll need Mother, what's wrong? Meg, sweet fool
You did all that you could
Shining bright
And yet still not enough Wh-what do you mean? How you danced
They're all entranced
Yes, all but the one
Whose entrancement we sought He wasn't there? Where, poor girl
Do you think that he was?
Yes, that's right
In with her all along With Christine? Claiming of their son they love
Too smitten to spare you
One moment of thought But you said All that you gave him
It's all been a waste You were wrong All that you've done
It has all been a waste Don't say that Now he has them
As for us we have
Both been replaced No Jesus, what a crowd
Nervous?
Just a bit
Kid, look who you are
The headline act
A major star
You're already a hit
Got a match?
Wonder what he'll think
The boss?
Ha, if he's even here
Honey, please, he's here
And in just two days
He'll be there tossing you bouquets
At our gala premiere
Picture it
The cream of Manhattan
Celebrities, millionaires
Watching you
I'll be waiting in the wing
Wound up tighter than a spring
As the house begins to dim
And I'll practice every line
Hoping desperately to shine
Shining only for him
Just imagine how they'll cheer
At the moment you appear
Stepping out before the scrim
Let them whoop and let them call
I won't hear the crowd at all
No, it's only for him
Tell me how I look
Fine
Just fine?
What about my hair?
Beautiful
You swear?
Trust me, once the boss sees
How you put that song across
Hell, he ain't got a prayer
Oh, you mean it?
You'll stand proud into the light
Looking lovely
Burning bright
All vitality and vive
Aha, and I'll rapturously float
Through the melody he wrote
Singing only for him
And before the music dies
Up, the audience will rise
Nearly bursting at the brim
And you'll stand there in the glow
And perhaps, at last he'll know
Girls, hurry up, we're on
Where is she?
Look
(The center)
Just look at the poster
(There, the ooh-la-la girl)
Welcome, each and everyone
To our furvalent of fun
A buffet of bally-who
It's where Coney comes to play
And it's opening today
And it's only for you
And you
And you
And you
Entertainment day and night
Sure to dazzle and delight
And of course we'll be there too
Yooh
We're so happy that you're here
For this season's big premiere
And it's only for you
Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Megan Giri
The ooh-la-la girl
Five shows daily only here at Phantasma
And now the aerial [Incomprehensible]
Of the fabulous Miss Fleck
[Incomprehensible]
How was I?
Tell me
Meg, you were just perfect
And I say that not only as your mother but as your producer
Was he watching?
I'm sure he was, I'm sure he'll have much to say
About how much you've progressed
By the way, it seems you have an admirer, a certain Mr.Thompson
Is he important? Married Man Dreams of summer
Secret smiles between us
Our first meeting
You thought they had seen us
We first tried explaining
Then it started raining
Then you said "I love you, girl" and then
"I'm much too old to fall in love again" Time was golden
I felt I was falling
Waiting, smiling
Hoping you'd be calling
Loving eyes above me
Showing me you love me
I woke up beside you once and said
"I don't think I could fall in love again" Married man, you were happy and you let me know
As you run up the stairs to reach my door
But I cried every time you had to go
Should have said, "don't come here anymore" Winter's silence
Shadows on the ceiling
You said, "you're too young to know that feeling"
Then, your voice seemed colder
Then you said "I told her"
I said "well, she's older, but then
She's young enough to fall in love again" Though I tried to forget her as you live with me
But you cried when she begged you to return
You said "no, that's all over" but you lied
Married man, are you too old to learn? Spring can be a very cruel season
Help me, help me
Don't ask for a reason
Please you must believe me
I want you to leave me
One day if you're free
But not till then
I'm young enough to fall in love again
I'm young enough to fall in love again. Every time I look at you
I don't understand
Why you let the things you did
Get so out of hand
You'd have managed better
If you'd had it planned
Now why'd you choose such a backward time
And such a strange land? If you'd come today
You could have reached a whole nation

It was blue as ink
Or at least I think
I remember sky I remember snow
Soft as feathers, sharp as thumb tacks
Coming down like lint
And it made you squint When the wind would blow
And ice like vinyl on the streets
Cold as silver, white as sheets
Rain like springs and changing things
Like leaves I remember leaves
Green as spearmint, crisp as paper
I remember trees
Bare as coat racks
Spread like broken umbrellas And parks and bridges, ponds and zoos
Ruddy faces, muddy shoes
Light and noise and bees and boys
And days I remember days
Or at least I try
But as years go by
They're sort of haze And the bluest ink
Isn't really sky
And at times I think I would gladly die
For a day of sky C: Gustave, Gustave, Gustave.
P: What's wrong?
C: Gustave!
P: What's wrong?!
C: He should have been here. He was meant to be here!
P: It's that idiot Raoul. Why, I'll kill that drunken fool! That he dare touch that child. A child that isn't his. Mr. Squelch?!
M: Sir?
P: Seal the port, blockade each road. Call in every favor that I'm owed. I'll be damned if he leaves this isle!
M: The Vicomte de Chagny left here in a carriage, saw with my own eyes, sir. There was no one with him.
P: Are you quite certain he left here alone?
M: Sir, was there anyone else here backstage?
P: Yes, yes. Madam Giry, she was here, with her vicious little sneer and that comment she made. The ungratetful back biting snake! She's been greedious indeed. She'll get hers now guaranteed! Go now quickly! Bring her round! Bring the boy back safe and sound! Then I'll tear her limb from limb!
MG: What is the meaning of this? How dare your minions manhandle me in this fashion. I demand an answer.
P: The boy, woman. What have you done with him?
MG: The boy? You think I took the boy? Why would I do such a thing? You think I don't know who he is? All these years, who has been faithful more than I? No one!
P: Giry
MG: All these years, who could you think I'd hurt that child--
P: My patience is running dry--
MG: All these years, I've been mother to you and Christine as much as my daughter--
P: Enough!
MG: Do you think I don't know how it hurts to see one's child far too off?
P: Gustave, Gustave, Gustave.
F: Sir? I just passed Meg's dressing room. It was empty as a tomb, but her mirror was smashed all in pieces on the floor.
P: Meg?
MG: Oh my god.
F: And I saw her down the hall, pulling someone pale and small. And she looked all about and then scurried out the door.
MG: God I left her, so distraught. Please who knows just what she thought. I'm afraid she's come undone. But she won't hurt him. Meg would never hurt him. How could she hurt him?
P: I know where they've gone, but we must hurry!
MG: In that crowd? There are millions of people out there.
C: Gustave! My poor Gustave.
P: Theres no time to waist
C: Gustave!
(Crowd making noise)
C: Gustave, Gustave!
P: You there, stop!
C: It's not him.
MG: Meg.
P:I think I see them! This way!
C: Gustave! Is that... I'm so sorry.
MG: Meg, please.
P: To the pier! Sold. Your number, sir? Thank you.

Thank you, sir. A collector's piece indeed
Every detail exactly as she said
She often spoke of you, my friend
Your velvet lining, and your figurine of lead
Will you still play, when all the rest of us are dead? Lot 666, then, a chandelier in pieces.
Some of you may recall the strange affair of the Phantom of the Opera:
A mystery never fully explained.
We are told, ladies and gentlemen,
That this is the very chandelier which figures in the famous disaster.
Our workshops have repaired it and wired parts of it for the new electric light,
So that we may get a hint of how it may look when reassembled.
Perhaps we may frighten away the ghost of so many years ago with a little illumination, gentlemen? When your good nights have been said
And you are lying in bed
With the covers pulled up tight
And though you count every sheep
You get the feeling that sleep
Is gonna stay away tonight That's when you hear it coming
That is when you hear the humming
Of the midnight train
Here again
Can't explain that midnight train
That midnight train Starlight express, starlight express
Are you real? Yes or no?
Starlight express, answer me yes
I don't want you to go Come try to take me away
But bring me back before day
Light and fill the time between
Take me to everywhere
But don't abandon me there
Just want to say I've been I believe in you completely
Though I may be dreaming sweetly
Of the Starlight express, starlight express
Are you real? Yes, or no?
Starlight express, answer me yes
I don't want you to go And if your there
And if you know
Then show me which way
I should go Starlight express, starlight express
Are you real? Yes, or no?
Starlight express, answer me yes
I don't want you to go Starlight express, starlight express
Are you real? Yes, or no?
Starlight express, answer me yes
I need you to be here Daylight, see the dew on the sunflower
And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is Look
A new day has begun Little Lotte, let her mind wander? You remember that, too
Little Lotte thought, am I fonder of dolls or of goblins, of shoes?
Or of riddles, of frock? Those picnics in the attic, or of chocolates?
Father playing the violin as we read to each other dark stories of the north "No what I love best", Lotte said, "Is when Im asleep in my bed
And the Angel of Music sings songs in my head?
The Angel of Music sings song in my head?" Insolent boy! This slave of fashion basking in your glory!
Ignorant fool! This brave young suitor, sharing in my triumph!
Angel! I hear you! Speak, I listen, stay by my side, guide me!
Angel, my soul was weak, forgive me, enter at last, master! Flattering child, you shall know me, see why in shadow I hide!
Look at your face in the mirror, I am there, inside!
Angel of Music! Guide and guardian! Grant to me your glory!
Angel of Music! Hide no longer! Come to me, strange angel I am your angel, come to me Angel of Music
Whose is that voice? Who is that in there?
I am your Angel of Music come to me Angel of Music
Christine! Angel! That's the place that you ruined, you fool
What do you mean?
That's the world you destroyed with your greed
It wasn't my fault, I couldn't have known Don't you remember what happened back then?
When we, even we dared to walk among men?
When even a Phantom could dream
His dark dreams once again When I was a kid, I played on this street
I always loved illusion
I thought make-believe was truer than life
But now it's all confusion Please, can you tell me what's happening?
I just don't know anymore
If this is real, how should I feel?
What should I look for? If you were smart, you would keep on walking
Out of my life as fast as you can
I'm not the one you should pin your hopes on
You're falling for the wrong kind of man This is crazy, you know we should call it a day
Sound advice, great advice
Let's throw it away I can't control all the things I'm feeling
I haven't got a prayer
If I'm a fool, well
I'm too much in love to care I knew where I was, I'd given up hope
Made friends with disillusion
No one in my life, but I look at you
And now it's all confusion Please, can you tell me what's happening?
I just don't know anymore
If this is real, how should I feel?
What should I look for? I thought I had everything I needed
My life was set, my dreams were in place
My heart could see, way into the future
All of that goes when I see your face I should hate you
There I was, the world in my hand
Can one kiss, kiss away
Everything I planned? I can't control all the things I'm feeling
I'm floating in mid-air
I know it's wrong, but
I'm too much in love to care I thought I had everything I needed
My life was set, my dreams were in place
My heart could see way into the future
All of that goes when I see your face
This is crazy, you know we should call it a day Sound advice
Great advice
Let's throw it away I can't control all the things I'm feeling
We're floating in mid-air
If we are fools, well
We're too much in love to care
If we are fools, well
We're too much in love to care Hurry up!
You won't believe it
Take a look what's over here!
Who imagined just how big the place would be
The man called Mr Y put it up in just a year
It's a little slice of heaven by the sea Look, there's restaurants
A midway
A gigantic concert hall
The biggest fun house ever seen
A volcano that erupts each day at three
Wonders brought from round the world
The season's just begun and Mr Y has got it all
Crystal fountains, grand pavilions
Hell, it hust have cost him millions
It's a little slice of heaven by the sea Over here! The sights, the sounds
The lights, the smells
The wonder wheels, the carousels
The gardens and arcades
The marble collonades The rides (the rides), the shows (the shows)
The games (the games) of chance
The rush (the rush), the whirl (the whirl)
The sheer (the sheer) romance And the rumours
What about 'em
Things so odd you daren't doubt 'em
Freaks and monsters, abhorrations
With mechanical creations And the genius who designed it wears a mask
A mask, a mask But what's behind it?
What's behind it?
What's behind it?
What's behind it?
What's behind it? (instrumental) Fancy ballrooms
Altered spaces
Shoot the shoots and
Steeple chases A casino, a museum
Look, a Roman Colosseum
And a concert hall that's bigger than the Met What's inside it?
What's inside it?
What's inside it?
What's inside it? Whistle down the wind
Let your voices carry
Drown out all the rain
Light a patch of darkness
Treacherous and scary Howl at the stars
Whisper when you're sleeping
I'll be there to hold you
I'll be there to stop
The chills and all the weeping Make it clear and strong
So the whole night long
Every signal that you send
Until the very end
I will not abandon you my precious friend So try to stem the tide
Then you'll raise a banner
Send a flare up in the sky
Try to burn a torch
And try to build a bonfire Every signal that you send
Until the very end
I'm there So whistle down the wind
For I have always been
Right there Howl at the stars
Whisper when your sleeping
I'll be there to hold you
I'll be there to stop
The chills and all the weeping Make it clear and strong
So the whole night long
Every signal that you send
Until the very end
I will not abandon you my precious friend So try to stem the tide
Then you'll raise a banner
Send a flare up in the sky
Try to burn a torch
And try to build a bonfire Every signal that you send
Until the very end
I'm there So whistle down the wind
For I have always been
Right there. CROWD Hosanna

Nor the Romans, nor the Jews
Nor Judas, nor the twelve
Nor the priests, nor the scribes Nor doomed Jerusalem itself
Understand what power is
Understand what glory is
Understand at all, understand at all If you knew, all that I knew my poor Jerusalem
You'd see the truth but you'd live a lie
But you'd live a lie while you live
Your troubles are many Poor Jerusalem
To conquer death
You only have to die
You only have to die Once, you won't remember
If you said Hollywood, hers was the face you'd think of
Her face on every billboard
In just a single week, she's get ten thousand letters Men would offer
Fortunes for a bloom from her corsage
Or a few strands of her hair Today, she's half-forgotten
But it's the pictures that got small
She is the greatest star of all Then, you can't imagine
How fans would sacrifice themselves to touch her shadow
There was a maharajah
Who hanged himself with one of her discarded stockings She's immortal
Caught inside that flickering light beam
Is a youth which cannot fade Madame's a living legend;
I've seen so many idols fall
She is the greatest star of all It seems to me a strange thing, mystifying
That a man like you can waste his time
On such a concubine Yes, I can understand that she amuses
But to let her kiss you, stroke your hair
That's hardly in your line It's not that I object to her profession
But she doesn't fit in well
With what you teach and say It doesn't help us if you are inconsistent
They only need a small
Excuse to put us all away Who are you to criticise her?
Who are you to despise her?
Leave her, leave her, let her be now Leave her, leave her, she's with me now
If your slate is clean then you can throw stones
If your slate is not then leave her alone I'm amazed that men like you
Can be so shallow thick and slow
There is not a man among you
Who knows or cares if I came or go Save Judas
No you're wrong, you're very wrong
How can you say that?
Not one, not one of you Has the Persephone docked yet?
Yeah, the passengers are going through customs now
Here they come It's Mrs. Aster
Hey, Mrs. Aster, over here
Hey, how was the trip?
Is that the latest Paris style? Look, there's Colonel Vanderbilt
Hey, Colonel, enjoyed those French Pastries, did you?
There's nothing there we don't have
Bigger and better over here, I assure you
Thanks, Colonel There, that's Oscar Hammerstein, ain't it?
Hey, Mr. H, over here, this way
H-How was Europe?
Hey, there she is
Miss Daae, Miss Daae
Christine, Miss Daae Her name is Madame De Chagny
Now stand aside, stand aside please
No pictures, do you hear?
No pictures of my wife
No pictures of the boy Hey, hey Christine, why Coney Island?
Your first concert in years
Why aren't you singing it at the
The Countess has been engaged by a well known persona
Well known?
I have never seen the guy Hey, how do you lower great Christine Daa over here anyway
It's the money, right?
Yeah, all that American moolah?
Oh, hey, Christine, what you gonna sing, Yankee Doodle Moolah?
My wife is an artist, sir Yeah, and her art is payin' off your gamblin' debts
It's what they're sayin' in France
Is it true you left your entire fortune on a roulette table in Monte Carlo?
What an insult, how dare?
Father, not now, Gustave Hey kid, how's it feel to have a famous mother?
This your first time in America?
What do you plan do to here in Coney?
I, I want to learn how to swim
I said, leave the child alone
God's sake, didn't this Mr. Y send someone to receive us? Mother, look
Right over there
Across the square
What is it?
Strange, never seen anything like it Like yellow parchment is his skin
A great black hole serves as the nose which never grew You must be always on your guard
Or he will catch you with his magical lasso! Those who speak of what they know
Find too late, that prudent silence is wise
Joseph Buquet, hold your tongue
He will burn you with the heat of his eyes! Growltiger was a Bravo cat who travelled on a barge
In face he was the roughest cat that ever roamed at large
From Gravesend up to Oxford he pursued his evil aims
Rejoicing in his title of the 'Terror of the Thames'
His manners and appearance did not calculate to please
His coat was torn and seedy, it was baggy at the knees
Once ear was somewhat missing, no need to tell you why
And he scowled upon a hostile world from one forbidding eye
The cottagers of Rotherhithe knew something of his fame
At Hammersmith and Putney people shuddered at his name
The would fortify the hen house, lock up the silly goose
When the rumor ran along the shore: Growltiger's on the loose!
Woe to the weak canary that fluttered from it's cage
Woe to the pampered Pekeinese, that face Growltiger's rage
Woe to the bristly bandicoot, that lurks on foreign ships
And woe to any cat with whom Growltiger came to grips
But most to cats of foreign race his hatred had been vowed
To cats of foreign name and race no quarter was allowed
The Persian and the Siamese regarded him with fear
Because it was a Siamese had mauled his missing ear
Now on a peaceful summer night all nature seemed at play
The tender Moon was shining bright, the barge at Molsey lay
All in the balmy moonlight it lay rocking on the tide
And Growltiger was disposed to show his sentimental side
In the forepeak of the vessel Growltiger stood alone
Concentrating my attention on the Lady Griddlebone
And my raffish crew were sleeping in their barrels and their bunks
As the Siamese came creeping in their sampans and their junks
Growltiger had no eye or ear for aught but Griddlebone
And the lady seemed enraptured by my manly baritone
Disposed to relaxation and awaiting no surprise
But the moonlight sone reflected from a thousand bright blue eyes
And closer still and closer the sampans circled 'round
And yet from all the enemy there was not heard a soun
The foe was armed with toasting forks and cruel carving knives
And the lovers sang their last duet in danger of their lives
Then Genghis gave the signal to his fierce Monglian hordes
Abandoning their sampans, the Chinks they swarmed aboard
Abandoning their sampans, the pullaways, their junks
They battened down the hatches on the crew within their bunks
Then Griddlebone she gave a screech for she was badly skeered
I am sorry to admit it, but she quickly disappeared
She probably escaped with ease, I'm sure she was not drowned
But a serried ring of flashing steel Growltiger did surround
The ruthless foe pressed forward in subborn rank on rank
Growltiger to his vast surprise was forced to walk the plank
He who a hundered victims had driven to that drop
At the end of all his crimes was forced to go kerflip, kerflop
Oh there was joy in Wapping when the news flew through the land
At Maidenhead and Henley there was dancing on the strand
Rats were roasted whole in Brentford and Victoria Dock
And a day of celebration was commanded in Bangkok!
These modern productions are all very well
But there's nothing to equal from what I hear tell
That moment of mystery when I made history Jesus, I am overjoyed to meet you face to face.
You've been getting quite a name all around the place.
Healing cripples, raising from the dead.
And now I understand you're God,
At least, that's what you've said.
So, you are the Christ, you're the great Jesus Christ.
Prove to me that you're divine; change my water into wine.
That's all you need do, then I'll know it's all true.
Come on, King of the Jews.
Jesus, you just won't believe the hit you've made around here.
You are all we talk about, the wonder of the year.
Oh what a pity if it's all a lie.
Still, I'm sure that you can rock the cynics if you tried.
So, you are the Christ, you're the great Jesus Christ.
Prove to me that you're no fool; walk across my swimming pool.
If you do that for me, then I'll let you go free.
Come on, King of the Jews.
I only ask what I'd ask any superstar.
What is it that you have got that puts you where you are.
I am waiting, yes I'm a captive fan.
I'm dying to be shown that you are not just any man.
So, if you are the Christ, yes the great Jesus Christ
Feed my household with this bread.
You can do it on your head.
Or has something gone wrong. Jesus, why do you take so long?
Oh come on, King of the Jews.
Hey! Aren't you scared of me Christ?
Mr. Wonderful Christ?
You're a joke. You're not the Lord.
You are nothing but a fraud.
Take him away.
He's got nothing to say!
Get out you King of the,
Get out King of the,
Oh get out you King of the Jews!
Get out of here!
Get out of here you,
Get out of my life! I don't know how to love him
What to do, how to move him
I've been changed, yes really changed
In these past few days, when I've seen myself
I seem like someone else I don't know how to take this
I don't see why he moves me
He's a man. He's just a man
And I've had so many men before
In very many ways
He's just one more Should I bring him down?
Should I scream and shout?
Should I speak of love
Let my feelings out?
I never thought I'd come to this
What's it all about? Don't you think it's rather funny
I should be in this position
I'm the one who's always been
So calm, so cool, no lover's fool
Running every show
He scares me so I never thought I'd come to this
What's it all about?
Yet, if he said he loved me
I'd be lost. I'd be frightened
I couldn't cope, just couldn't cope I'd turn my head, I'd back away
I wouldn't want to know
He scares me so
I want him so I love him so (Judas)
There he is
They're all asleep, the fools (Jesus)
Judas, must you betray me
With a kiss? (Peter and Apostles)
What's the buzz
Tell me what's happening
Hang on Lord
We're gonna fight for you (Jesus)
Put away your sword
Don't you know that it's all over
It was nice but now it's gone
Why are you obsessed with fighting?
Stick to fishing from now on (Crowd)
Tell me Christ how you feel tonight
Do you plan to put up a fight?
Do you feel that you've had the breaks?
What would you say were your big mistakes?
Do you think that you may retire?
Did you think you would get much higher?
How do you view your coming trial?
Have your men proved all worthwhile? Come with us to see Caiaphas
You'll just love the high priest's house
You'll just love seeing Caiaphas
You'll just die in the high priest's house Come on God this is not like you
Let us know what you're gonna do
You know what your supporters feel
You'll escape in the final reel Tell me Christ how you feel tonight
Do you plan to put up a fight?
Do you feel that you've had the breaks?
What would you say were your big mistakes? Come with us to see Caiaphas
You just love the high priest's house
You just love seeing Caiaphas
You'll just die in the high priest's house Now we have him, now we got him
Now we have him, now we got him (Caiaphas)
Jesus you must realize
The serious charges facing you
You say you're the son of God
In all your handouts
Well is it true? (Jesus)
That's what you say
You say that I am Madame Giry: Phantasma
City of Wonders
Mr. Y presents
marvelous ,astonishments,
human prodities,
hm... the ooh la la girl,
Christine Daae,
spona for century
all...... all gone Fleck: yes, there's nothing left
nothing but ghosts

the freaks, the monsters, the bazaars,
where else could we resist but here?
and after the tragedy
after the master disappears with the child
after the fire consumed everything Madame Giry: in dream, from dream Fleck: remember how it was?? remember??
Coney isle ... glistering and glimmering
Rising bright
Drenched in light
See it smile
Beckoning and shimmering
All a-gleam
Like a Dream
Every fantasy set free
Summer rising by the sea Madame Giry: Coney isle miracle on miracle
See the sound burning round
Mile by mile
Loud and lewd and lyrical
Dream on dream never seen
all americ all was there
here next to billionare Madame Giry: in a vacate
a sensate and vondua
hall of fame
desperate in devastated noise
night and day
holding in by hundreds and thousands
swept away for everything
desire ...made for me Pharaoh said
Well, stone the crows
This Joseph is a clever kid
Who'd have thought that 14 cows
Could mean the things He said, they did
Joseph, you must help me further
I have got a job for you
You will help my through this crisis
You shall be my number two Pharaoh told his guards
To fetch a chisel from the local store
Whereupon he ordered them
To cut the chains that Joseph wore Joseph got a royal pardon
And a host of splendid things
A chariot of gold, a float
A medal, and some signet rings Joseph, Pharaoh's number two
(Joseph, Pharaoh's number two)
Joseph, Egypt looks to you
(Joseph, Egypt looks to you) Joseph, Pharaoh's number two
(Joseph, Pharaoh's number two)
Joseph, Egypt looks to you
(Joseph, Egypt looks to you)
Joseph Seven summers on the trot
Went perfect just as Joseph said
Joseph saw that food was gathered
Ready for the years ahead Seven years of famine followed
Egypt did not mind a bit
The recorded rationing
In history was a hit Joseph, how can we ever say
All that we want to, about you?
We're so glad that you came our way
We would have perished without you Joseph, we are the perfect team
Old buddies that's you and me
I was wise to have chosen you
You would be wise to agree Joseph, how can we ever say
All that we want to, about you?
We're so glad that you came our way
We would have perished without you We were in a jam
Would have baffled Abraham
But now we're a partnership
It's just a piece of cake Greatest man since Noah
Only goes to show ya
Anyone from anywhere can make it
If they get a lucky break This could be a happy ending
Perfect place to stop the show
Joseph after all has got
About as far as he could go But I'm sure that Jacob
And his other sons have crossed your mind
How the famine hit the family
Joseph left behind Stop, you robbers, your little number's up
One of you has stolen my precious golden cup
Joseph started searching through his brothers' sacks
Everyone was nervous, no one could relax
Who's the thief? Who's the thief? Is it Reuben? No, is it Simeon? No
Is it Naphtali? No, is it Dan? No
Is it Asher? No, is it Isaachar? No
Is it Levi? No, who's the man? Is it Zebulun? No, is it Gad? No
Is it Judah? No, is it him? Could it be
Could it be, could it possibly be Benjamin?
Yes, yes, yes Benjamin, you nasty youth
Your crime has shocked me to the core
Never in my whole career have I encountered this before
Guards, seize him, lock him in a cell
Throw the key into the Nile as well Each of the brothers fell to his knees
Show him some mercy, oh, mighty one, please
He would not do this, he must have been framed
Jail us and beat us, we should be blamed I will see you in a week or two
It's late, you better get going.
Take care of yourself and call anytime,
You feel, that you're missing me!
I can only say what I always say at these good-byes Come back with the same look in your eyes!
I know, you've got your work to do
And I know how much you love me.
But sometimes a friendly face can look good to you on a lonely night
If there comes a time, just remember,
I'm the kind that cries Come back with the same look in your eyes!
Everything, we want, we find in each other.
We would be fools to let love slip away.
Everything's so right,
I'm scared that we might lose it one day.
We could never keep things from one another,
You know all the feelings that are in my heart.
It's not easy, it's not easy when you have to be apart. So I'll see you in a week or two
It's late, you better get going.
You think that by now we know how to handle this
But we never will.
When you are away, everyday I pray
That nothing dies and you'll come back
With the same look in your eyes. Seven years of bumper crops are on their way
Years of plenty endless wheat and tons of hay
Your farms will boom, there won't be room
To store the surplus food you grow After that, the future doesn't look so bright
Egypt's luck will change completely over night
And famine's hand will stalk the land
With food, an all time low Noble king, there is no doubt
What your dreams are all about
All these things you saw in your pajamas
Are a long range forecast for your farmers And I'm sure it's crossed your mind
What it is you have to find
Find a man to lead you through the famine
With a flair for economic planning But who this man could be, I just don't know
Who this man could be, I just don't know
Who this man could be, I just don't know Thus all fairy stories end only an actress would pretend
Affairs of state are her latest play, eight shows a week, two matinees
My how the worm begins to turn, when will the chorus girl ever learn?
My how the worm begins to turn, when will the chorus girl ever learn? The chorus girl hasn't learned the lines you'd like to hear
She won't go scrambling over the backs of the poor to be accepted
By making donations just large enough to the correct charity
She won't be president of your wonderful societies of philanthropy
Even if you asked her to be as you should have asked her to be The actress hasn't learned the lines you'd like to hear
She won't join your clubs, she won't dance in your halls
She won't help the hungry once a month at your tombolas
She'll simply take control as you disappear Forgive my intrusion but fine as those sentiments sound
Little has changed for us peasants down here on the ground
I hate to sound childish, ungrateful, I don't like to moan
But do you now represent anyone's cause but your own?
Everything done will be justified by my foundation

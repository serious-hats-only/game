Fucked her in a helicopter, now she screamin' "Sky's the limit"
Fuck her in the drop top, now she screamin' "Sky's the limit"
Sent her back to who she with,

I spoke to Jay the other day, he's still the kingpin
He's still the only nigga that I woulda signed to
If I ain't sign to Wayne's perfectly designed crew
'Cause we the big 3, don't need a big speech
We made the biggest impact, check the spreadsheet

Niggas gettin' more cheese, kissy face

Won't shoot her but I will gun-butt the bitch
When we say "Fuck the bitch" dick-up the bitch
She was stuck-up so my niggas stuck up the bitch
Still draggin' her so don't pick up the bitch
Get the combination to the safe, drug the bitch

When it come to stealin' flows, these birds is fluent

Styled on 'em in this Burberry trench
These birds copy every word, every inch
But gang gang got the hammer and the wrench (brrr)
I pull up in that quarter milli off the lot
Oh, now she tryna be friends like I forgot
Show off my diamonds like I'm signed by the Roc (by the rock)
Ain't pushin' out his babies 'til he buy the rock [Chorus]
Ayo, I been on, bitch, you been corn

Box seats, bitch, fuck the gossip

Abstaining from sex had to zen my body

Gotta be king status to get in my body [Chorus] [Verse 2]
Put my blood, sweat and tears in perfecting my craft
Still every team's number one pick in the draft

Kobe, KD, Kyrie! Pick a K [Chorus] [Outro]
Aah, na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na, na

Yeah, that was a setup for a punchline on duct tape
Worried 'bout if my butt fake
Worry 'bout ya'll niggas, us straight
These girls are my sons, Jon and Kate plus eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of an update
Hut-hut one, hut- hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fuck with them real niggas who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is
These hoes couldn't test me even if they name was pop quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck wit', mad bitches we don't fuck wit'
I don't fuck wit' them chickens unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in like seasoning And tell them bitches, blow me, Lance Stephenson Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only Rich niggas only, independent bitches only Boss niggas only, thick bitches only I got my real niggas here by my side, only I never fucked Nicki cause she got a man
But when that's over then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought God damn, this is the perfect time
We had just come from that video
You know LA traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt
But I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low key or maybe high key
I been peeped that you like me, you know
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW, yea
Type to wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Claire Huxtable Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you The bad ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you
Oh, that's cause I believe in something, I stand for it And Nicki if you ever try to fuck
Just give me the heads up so I can plan for it I never fucked Nicki and that's fucked up
If I did fuck she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
Cause she act like she need dick in her life
But that's another story, I'm no story teller
I piss greatness like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend would beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mother's instead
You got the hiccups, you swallow the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, street beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' bout running in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes wit me, messed up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang take the B off behavior, my nigga
For reals if you mouth off I blow your face off
I mean pop-pop-pop then I take off, nigga
Now you see me, nigga, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
16 in the clip, one in the chamber
17 ward bully with 17 bullets
My story is how I went from poor me
To please pour me a drink and celebrate with me [Verse 1]
Ayo, look like I'm goin' for a swim
Dunk on 'em, now I'm swingin' off the rim
Bitch ain't comin' off the bench
While I'm comin' off the court fully drenched
Here, get some haterade, get ya thirst quenched
Styled on 'em in this Burberry trench
These birds copy every word, every inch
But gang gang got the hammer and the wrench (brrr)
I pull up in that quarter milli off the lot
Oh, now she tryna be friends like I forgot
Show off my diamonds like I'm signed by the Roc (by the rock)
Ain't pushin' out his babies 'til he buy the rock [Chorus]
Ayo, I been on, bitch, you been corn

Box seats, bitch, fuck the gossip

So they can get on their fucking keyboards!
And make me the bad guy, Chun-Li [Chorus]
Ayo, I been on, bitch, you been corn

All white top, all white belt
And all white jeans, body looking like milk
No time for games, she's full grown
My chick bad, tell your chick to go home [Chorus] [Ludacris - Verse 2]
Now your girl might be sick but my girl sicker
She rides that dick and she handles her liquor
She knock a bitch out aaaand fight
Coming out swinging like Tiger Woods wife
Yeah she could get a little hasty
Chicks better cover up there chests like pasty's
Couple girl friends and they all a little crazy
Coming down the street like a parade Macy's
I fill her up balloons
Test her and guns get drawn like cartoons
Doh, but I aint talkin bout homer
Chick so bad the whole crew wanna bone her [Chorus] [Nicki Minaj]
Yo, now all these bitches wanna try and be my besty
But I take a left and leave them hanging like a testi
Trash talk to em then I put em in a hefty
Running down a court I'm thuggin on them Lisa Lefty
It's going down, basement, friday 13th guess who's playing Jason
Tuck yourself in you better hold on to your teddy
It's nightmare on Elm street and guess who's playing Freddy
(My chick bad)
Chef cooking for me, they say my shoe game crazy
The mental Asylum looking for me
You a rookie to me
I'm in dat wam bam purple Lam' damn bitch you been a fan. [Chorus] [Chorus]
Work hard, just to get half back
Used to work hard, just to get half back
Now I'm gettin' to it that way
Straight up, straight up
I ain't coming through unless the bag straight
I used to work hard just to get half back
Used to work hard, just to get half back [Verse 1]
Ayo, just last week I told 'em to pick a side
I bust shots, don't duck if it don't apply
Bae out in Paris, he told me to pick a ride
Sike, made you look, I still didn't pick a guy
I'm the trophy of the game, everybody tryna win me
Me, Olivier, Jordan Dunn, my baby, Winnie
Partying in Paris, these bitches is embarassed
'Cause they know I'm the queen, I still didn't pick an heiress
Mirror, mirror, who's the fairest?
(You the motherfucking fairest, Nicki)
What I drop on this watch?
(I don't know, about a hundred-fifty)
I'm who they wishin' to be
These hoes is on the 'Gram, Nicki pitchin' the ki'
'Bout to cop Neverland, Michael up in the tree
You got bars and still broke? You might as well took the plea, uh
Be in the bando
Or would you rather move weight, Don Pablo?
Uh [Chorus]
Work hard, just to get half back
Used to work hard, just to get half back
Now I'm gettin' to it that way
Straight up, straight up
I ain't coming through unless the bag straight
I used to work hard just to get half back
Used to work hard, just to get half back [Verse 2]
Ayo, just last week I told 'em they run done
My legacy could never be undone
I'm a prodigy, R.I.P Thun-Thun
Got these bitches shook, they shocked, they stun-gunned
I'm the billy, billy goat, the goat, the goat's here
Vintage Hermes by Jean Paul Gaultier
Lagerfeld customize my gold chair
I run the point, you bitches just go cheer
Uh, look at my knockoffs, I told 'em knock it off
Anything that Nicki do, you know they knock it off
Put my crown on again, and I'ma knock it off
Anything with Nicki in it, they gonna pocket off
I mean profit off, my plug drop it off
You see them copyin' my hair, tell 'em "chop it off"
Uh, wad gyal with the top is off
And dem say 'em [?] when we drop 'em off
Uh, I ain't never played a ho's position
I ain't ever have to strip to get the pole position
Hoes is dissin'? Okay, these hoes is wishin'
You're in no position to come for O's position
I ain't movin' weight, but I'm in the dope position
I ain't movin' weight, but I'm in the dope position [Chorus]
Work hard, just to get half back
Used to work hard, just to get half back
Now I'm gettin' to it that way
Straight up, straight up
I ain't coming through unless the bag straight
I used to work hard just to get half back
Used to work hard, just to get half back [Outro]
W-w-w-w-w-work hard
W-w-w-w-w-work hard
J-j-just last week, I told 'em to pick a side
I-I-I bust shots, don't duck if they don't apply I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly
I wish today it will rain all day
Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away
Trying to forgive you for abandoning me
Praying but I think I'm still an angel away
Angel away, yeah strange in a way Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got their guns out aiming at me
But I become near when they aiming at me
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood They start coming and I start rising Must be surprising, I'm just summising
I win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher
More fire
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise To fly
To fly Everybody wanna try to box me in
Suffocating everytime it locks me in
Paintin' they own pictures then they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that can ever be defined I am not fly, I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear That is how I know that the time is near
So we become alive in a time of fear
And I ain't got no muthafucking time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard your nays become yays
Yankee Stadium with Jays and Kanyes
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly
Get ready for it Get ready for it
Get ready for it
I came to win
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
I came to win
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly Do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes
They only pretend, you would be mine
And you know how you made me, believe
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat
Balenciaga's on my boots with the python strap
You was caught up in the rush, and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before, I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, man you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'
Cause I was doing it for us, I told em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating
Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along I'mma ask on the song Do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes
They only pretend, you will be mine
And you know how you made me, believe
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved But do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed your bed of lies I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice em
If you had a heart, I was hoping you would've showed it some
What the fuck you really telling me, what you telling me
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along
I'mma ask on the song So does she know I've been in that bed before
A thousand count, and not a single threaded truth If I was just another girl
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me, when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself Do you ever think of me, when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes
They only pretend, you will be mine
And you know how you made me, believe
You had me caught in every web, that you weaved
But do you ever think of me, when you lie?

Never let a clown nigga try to play you
If he play you, then rule #2:
Fuck his best friends, then make 'em yes-men And get a dick pic, and then you press send
And send a red heart and send a kissy face
And tell him that his friends love how your pussy tastes
And that's rule #3, I'm the school T

Best flow in the game, this is not a lie
Tell them bitches cross they t's and dot they I

You know I still lead the league in scoring
You know I'm still bad and I'm still foreign
I'ma give bitches time to get hot Chill out at the game, New York, nigga buck
If they actually got bars, they could rock
But if not, I'ma destroy chicks a lot
But on the real, I'm album mode
Just dropped this freestyle 'fore these files get old
When I lay low, bitches be safe and sound
When I come back, they better not make a sound

Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair, right now? Uhh

I might kiss the baddest bitch, if you dare me
I ain't never need a man, to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this

You know, uhn, uhn, uhn) Uh, thinkin' out loud
I could be broke and keep a million dollar smile
LOL to the bank checkin' my account
Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account
Pretty ladies, are you here? Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low
You ain't gotta tell your friend that I eat it in the morning
Cause she gonna say "I know"
Can I hit it in the bathroom? Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub
Girl, this my new dance move
I just don't know what to call it
But bitch you dancing with the stars

I bought some cocaine, you can snort it
She became a vacuum, put it on my dick like carpet

Smallest regardless, largest in charge and born in New Orleans
Get killed for Jordans
Skateboard, I'm gnarly; Drake, Tunechi and Barbie
You know (You know) (Uhn, uhn, uhn
You know, uhn, uhn, uhn) He said he came from Jamaica
He owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was getting money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things
Ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to sing sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
5-year bid up, North on they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him
Put him on lock, seatbelt them
Took him out to Belgium, welcome!
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order
I call him Daddy like daughters He like it when I get drunk
But I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa
I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy
Then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone

She got a nigga at home and one on the side
Best friend is a dike, they fucked around a few times
Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight

I tell her: "bitch, you crazy, fück wrong with you?
And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hitting
And I say: "what about them niggas?"
She say: "what about them niggas?"
You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on something tight Don't judge me, I get life

Pussy like a oven too hot to put my tongue in
All I had to do is rub it
The genie out the bottle
Pussy so wet, I'm a need goggles

I tell her stop lying, mine and who else?

Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there will never be a sequel
And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful
As long as 7 years from now, I'm taking my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was '06
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I look down, yes I suppose
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'mma ride I'm with you still the night is young
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go
We wake back up and do it all again
We know, we know, say fuck the world, we ridin' til the end
When all is said and done, look at what we've become
I just want you to know, that I did it for you I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?
Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know that I love him
Family ties broken before me, niggas trynna kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me, yes I get it, I get it, it was all me
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes, the last day he saw me All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'mma ride I'm with you still the night is young
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go
We wake back up and do it all again
We know, we know, say fuck the world, we ridin' til the end
When all is said and done, look at what we've become
I just want you to know, that I did it for you Let me make this clear I'm not difficult, I'm just about my business
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself, and that's a fact
I'd give it all, if I could somehow, just rekindle that
She never understands, why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like, somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say "We did it!"
My child with Aaron, would've have been sixteen, any minute
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah, is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Yeah we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writing, this is The Pinkprint All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'mma ride I'm with you still the night is young
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go
We wake back up and do it all again
We know, we know, say fuck the world, we ridin' til the end

I'm a bad bitch and I fuck good Know a couple niggas that's down to ride for a homicide
When it's drama time
Run up on a nigga with the llamas flyin
Leave his loved ones all traumatized
One-fifty I'm really wit' it
I'll drop his ass and then forget it
I'm the man round my side of town Might see a bitch and forget I hit it I'm a young nigga I be getting money
Take your bitch from you
And these niggas get no respect
I'mma stay 100 till I'm 6 under
Matter fact I gotta keep it 150

Straight killers I can call so many

Shorties standing in the streets with tools
Where I'm from we don't play no games
Ain't no April fools, you will make the news
Where I hang we don't say no names
If you talk to cop I stay away from you
Keep your mouth shut in them investigations
You'll be out the station in a day or two
Dedication and a little patience
Leave the domination on my way to greatness
Don't put yourself up in a situation
Putting my relations in your conversations
Shoot a opposition with no hesitation
You get my position nigga better take it

Tryna leave the game but they never made it

(I just wanna be your favorite) Here we go again, it's the game we love
Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade, in your face, and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just planning a wedding, caught cagin' doves
You was just tellin' your mans, that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs Are you alone? Do you need someone?
Is it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?
Thousand words don't change a thing
Is it only three? Three words that you're missing? Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think I know Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o
We're 'bout to play here
We're 'bout to play here
Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o
We're 'bout to play
The crying game I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game Welcome to the crying game where you lose your soul
Where it ain't no easy cash, you got to use the toll
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?
Another slap to the face, another uppercut
I'm just abusive by nature, not cause I hate ya
Not cause I wanna, guess I wanna imitate ya
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin' or goin'?
I couldn't breathe and you ain't even know it
How come you never show it?
All this love you speak of
All I want is to love and to be loved
(To love and to be loved) I'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win
And I'm coming undone
Cause the tears don't end Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think I know Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o
We're 'bout to play here
We're 'bout to play here
Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o
We're 'bout to play
The crying game I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're 'bout to play here

Would you, would you give your
All for your all?
Would you, would you give your
Would you, would you give your
Would you, would you give your
All for your all?
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn her up, 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn her up, 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here
Crazy in here (Nicki Minaj)
I just had a epiphany,
I need to go to Tiffany's
Fendi on my slippers,
And my cookies always slippery
I don't need help,
I pay the bills on time
So I be yellin "fuck'em"
With a dildo sign
Five little mama, you a Three star
I aint sleepin when
I say I'm in my dream car
Oh did I stutta?
Harajuku hyphen,
Barbie... I'm hot
I think it's time to put the rice in
I was in the chair,
I was gluing my weave in
When you hit the stage
They was booin and leavin
Young money red flag,
No more auditions
Ask Lil Wayne who the 5 star bitch is! I can be selfish
Yeah, so impatient
Sometimes I feel like Marilyn Monroe
I'm insecure, yeah, I make mistakes
Sometimes I feel like I'm at the end of the road I can get low, I can get low
Don't know which way is up
Yeah, I can get high, I can get high
Like I could never come down Call it a curse
Or just call me blessed
If you can't handle my worst
You ain't getting my best
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt felt felt felt?
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt felt felt felt It's like all the good things
They fall apart like...
Like Marilyn Monroe Truth is we mess up
'Til we get it right
I don't want to end up losing my soul I can get low, I can get low
Don't know which way is up
Yeah, I can get high, I can get high
Like I could never come down Call it a curse
Or just call me blessed
If you can't handle my worst
You ain't getting my best
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt felt felt felt?
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt felt felt felt Take me or leave me
I'll never be perfect
Believe me I'm worth it
So take me or leave me
(So take me or leave me)
So take me or leave me
(So take me or leave me)
Call it a curse or just call
Me blessed if you can't handle
My worst you ain't getting my best
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt felt, felt?
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt?
must be how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt Maybe you died 'cause everybody asked me, "Where you at?"
I tried to channel you in hopes that I could stare back.
But it's like every intersection we just missed each other.
You got your fans waiting. Tell me you ain't 6 feet under.
And tell that you coming back and you just took a break.
Maybe I blamed you for everything - That was my mistake.
In hindsight, I loved your rawness and I loved your edge.
'Cause it was you who talked me down from jumping off the ledge.
Your earrings bamboo.
Your long nails, too.
Your BMW.
Every time you came through.
You was the brave heart.
You stole Wayne heart.
You never switched it up.
You played the same part.
But I needed to grow.
And I needed to know.
Were there some things inside of me that I needed to show?
So I just deaded you.
Left you in all black.
But dear, old Nicki
Please call back. You told me you'd come when I needed you.
And you said it so sweetly I believed you
But I'm standing here calling.
I can't see you.
But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that. Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamour?
Money, fame and power?
'Cause if so that will forever go down my lamest hour.
I should've kept you with me gettin' at them nameless cowards.
There was no match for you.
Couldn't defeat your prowess.
I had to make them changes - I hope you understood.
You see for every bad, I did a ton of good.
But you was underground and I was mainstream.
I live the life now, that we would daydream.
My only wish is you come enjoy it with me.
Get on them conference calls.
Go meet them lawyers with me.
The money came. Yeah.
Tripled and quadrupled it.
But I still miss us when we was just on some stupid shit.
And it still fucked the media.
They ridiculed you.
Never believed in ya.
They just deaded you.
Left you in all black.
But dear old Nicki.
Please call back. You told me you'd come when I needed you.
And you said it so sweetly I believed you.
But I'm standing here calling.
I can't see you.
But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that. And, yes. I'm holding you, holding you, holding you
And, yes. I'm holding you, holding you, holding you
And, yes. I'm holding you, holding you, holding you to that.
And, yes. I'm holding you, holding you, holding you
And, yes. I'm holding you, holding you, holding you
And, yes. I'm holding you, holding you, holding you to that.

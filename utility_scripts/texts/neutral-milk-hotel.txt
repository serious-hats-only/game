What a beautiful face
I have found in this place
That is circling all round the sun
What a beautiful dream
That could flash on the screen
In a blink of an eye and be gone from me
Soft and sweet
Let me hold it close and keep it here with me And one day we will die
And our ashes will fly from the aeroplane over the sea
But for now we are young
Let us lay in the sun
And count every beautiful thing we can see
Love to be
In the arms of all I'm keeping here with me What a curious life
They have found here tonight
There is music, there is sounds from the street
There are lights in the clouds Anna's ghost all around
Hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me
Soft and sweet
How the notes all bend and reach above the trees
Now how I remember you
How I would push my fingers through
Your mouth to make those muscles move
That made your voice so smooth and sweet And now we keep where we don't know
All secrets sleep in winter clothes
With one you loved so long ago
Now he don't even know his name
What a beautiful face
I have found in this place
That is circling all round the sun
And when we meet on a cloud
I'll be laughing out loud
I'll be laughing with everyone I see
Can't believe how strange it is to be anything at all Oh comely
I will be with you when you lose your breath Chasing the only
Meaningful memory you thought you had left
With some pretty
Bright and bubbly
Terrible scene that was doing her thing on your chest
But oh comely
It isn't as pretty as you'd like to guess
In your memory you're drunk on your awe to me
It doesn't mean anything at all
Oh comely
All of your friends are all letting you blow
Bristling and ugly
Bursting with fruits falling out from the holes
Of some pretty
Bright and bubbly
Friend you could need to say comforting things in
your ear
But oh comely
There isn't such one friend that you could find here
Standing next to me he's only my enemy
I'll crush him with everything I own
Say what you want to say and hang for your hollow ways
Moving your mouth to pull out all your miracles aimed
For me
Your father made fetuses with flesh licking ladies
While you and your mother were asleep in the
trailer park
Thunderous sparks from the dark of the stadiums
The music and medicine you needed for comforting
So make all your fat fleshy fingers to moving and
Pluck all your silly strings and bend all your notes for me
Soft silly music is meaningful magical
The movements were beautiful all in your ovaries All of them milking with green fleshy flowers
While powerful pistons were sugary sweet machines
Smelling of semen all under the garden
Was all you were needing when you still believed in me
Say what you want to say and hang for your
hollow ways
Moving your mouth to pull out all your miracles aimed
For me
And I know they buried her body with others her
Sister and mother and 500 families
And will she remember me 50 years later I
Wished I could save her in some sort of time machine
Know all your enemies
We know who are enemies are
Know all your enemies
We know who our enemies are
Goldaline my dear we will fold and freeze
together
Far away from here there is sun and spring and green forever
But now we move to feel for ourselves inside some stranger's stomach
Place your body here let your skin begin to blend
itself
With mine Two-headed boy
All floating in glass
The sun it has passed, now it's blacker than black
I can hear as you tap on your jar I am listening to hear where you are
I am listening to hear where you are Two-headed boy
Put on Sunday shoes
And dance 'round the room to accordion keys
With the needle that sings in your heart Catching signals that sound in the dark
Catching signals that sound in the dark We will take off our clothes
And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine
And when all is breaking everything that you could keep inside
Now your eyes ain't moving now, they just lay there in their climb Two-headed boy
With pulleys and weights
Creating a radio play just for two
In the parlor with a moon across her face And through the music he sweetly displays
Silver speakers that sparkle all day
Made for his lover who's floating
And choking with her hands across her face And in the dark we will take off our clothes
And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine
And when all is breaking everything that you could keep inside
Now your eyes ain't moving now, they just lay there in their climb Two-headed boy
There's no reason to grieve
The world that you need is wrapped in gold silver sleeves
Left beneath Christmas trees in the snow
And I will take you and leave you alone
Watching spirals of white softly flow
Over your eyelids and all you did
Will wait until the point when you let go Two
One, two, three, four The only girl I've ever loved
Was born with roses in her eyes But then they buried her alive
One evening 1945
With just her sister at her side
And only weeks before the guns
All came and rained on everyone
Now she's a little boy in Spain Playing pianos filled with flames
On empty rings around the sun
All sing to say my dream has come
But now we must pick up every piece Of the life we used to love
Just to keep ourselves
At least enough to carry on
And now we ride the circus wheel
With your dark brother wrapped in white Says it was good to be alive
But now he rides a comet's flame
And won't be coming back again
The earth looks better from a star
That's right above from where you are
He didn't mean to make you cry With sparks that ring and bullets fly
On empty rings around your heart
The world just screams and falls apart
But now we must pick up every piece Of the life we used to love
Just to keep ourselves
At least enough to carry on
And here's where your mother sleeps
And here is the room where your brothers were born
Indentions in the sheets
Where their bodies once moved but don't move anymore
And it's so sad to see the world agree
That they'd rather see their faces fill with flies
All when I'd want to keep white roses in their eyes What a beautiful face
I have found in this place
That is circling all round the sun
What a beautiful dream
That could flash on the screen
In a blink of an eye and be gone from me
Soft and sweet

Indentions in the sheets
Where their bodies once moved but don't move anymore
And it's so sad to see the world agree
That they'd rather see their faces fill with flies
All when I'd want to keep white roses in their eyes When you were young, you were the King of carrot flowers
And how you built a tower tumbling through the trees
In holy rattlesnake that fell all around your feet And your mum would stick a fork right into daddy's shoulder
And dad would throw the garbage all across the floor
As we would lay and learn what each others bodies were for And this is the room, one afternoon I knew I could love you
And from above you how I sank into your soul
Into that secret place where no one dares to go And your mom would drink until' she was no longer speaking
And dad would dream of all the different ways to die
Each one a little more than he could dare to try... When you were young you were the king of carrot flowers
And how you built a tower tumbling through the trees
In holy rattlesnakes that fell all around your feet And your mom would stick a fork right into daddy's shoulder
And dad would throw the garbage all across the floor
As we would lay and learn what each other's bodies were for And this is the room one afternoon I knew I could love you
And from above you how I sank into your soul
Into that secret place where no one dares to go And your mom would drink until she was no longer speaking
And dad would dream of all the different ways to die
Each one a little more than he could dare to try Your prettiness is seeping through
Out from the dress I took from you
So pretty
And my emptiness is swollen shut
Always a wretch - I have become
So empty
And please, please dont leave me I'm watching Naomi, full bloom
I'm hoping she will soon explode
Into one billion tastes and tunes
One billion angels come and hold her down
They could hold her down until she shines I'm tasting Naomi's perfume
It tastes like shit and I must say
She comes and goes most afternoons
One billion lovers wave and love her now
They could love her now and so could I There is no Naomi in view
She walks through Cambridge stocks and strolls
And if she only really knew
One billion angels could come and save her soul
They could save her soul until she shines So pretty And please, please don't leave me here. Jeff: "This is a Phil Spector song." I love how your eyes close
Whenever you kiss me
And when I'm away from you
I love how you miss me
I love the way your kiss is always heavenly
But darling most of all
I love how you love me I love how your heart beats
Whenever I hold you
I love how you think of me
Without being told to
I love the way your touch is always tenderly
But darling most of all
I love how you love me I love how your eyes close
Each time that you kiss me
And when I'm away from you
I love how you miss me
I love the way your kiss is always heavenly
But darling most of all
I love how you love me (Instrumental) Sweet communist, the communist daughter
Standing on the seaweed water
Semen stains the mountaintops
Semen stains the mountaintops With cocoa leaves along the border
Sweetness swings from every corner
Cars careening from the clouds
The bridges burst and twist around And wanting something warm and moving
Bend towards herself, the soothing
Proves that she must still exist
She moves herself about her fits And wanting something warm and moving
Bends towards herself
The soothing proves that she must still exist,
She moves herself about her fits. Sweet communist, the communist daughter
Standing on the seaweed water
Semen stains the mountaintops
Semen stains the mountaintops Ghost, ghost
I know you live within me
Feel as you fly
In thunder clouds above the city
Into one that I
Loved with all that was left within me
Until we tore in two
Now wings and rings
And there're so many waiting here for you
And she was born in a bottle-rocket
1929
With wings that rings around a socket
Right between her spine
All drenched in milk and holy water pouring from the sky
I know that she will live forever
She won't ever die
And she goes
And now she knows she'll never be afraid
To watch the morning paper blow into a hole
where no one can escape
(de de de de de)
And one day in New York City baby
A girl fell from the sky
From the top of a burning apartment building
fourteen stories high
And when her spirit left her body
How it split the sun!
I know that she will live forever
All goes on and on and on and
She goes
And now she knows she'll never be afraid
To watch the morning paper blow into a hole
where no one can escape
(de de de de de) Growing sleepy as the rain falls
As children draped in flowers form a chain
They sing a song with jelly jars and bird calls
As night falls into dusk and it's day again I'm not afraid of love parade in my daydream
Old men with kazoos and beating drums
But I awake and I see the streets are ice cream
It's just you and me and oh dear, our life has just begun Everything is beautiful here
It's spinning circles around my ears
I'm finally breaking free from fear
And it's fading Oh beautiful smiles, won't you stay awhile
We could close the door and sleep all day
It's a September sky with pretty pictures in my mind
That's lost its feeling of so afraid Everything is beautiful here
It's spinning circles around my ears
I'm finally breaking free from fear
And it's fading on Growing sleepy now as the rain falls
As children draped in flowers form a chain
They sing a song with jelly jars and bird calls
As night falls into dusk and it's day again
Everything is beautiful here
It's spinning circles around my ears
I'm finally breaking free from fear
And it's fading on, fading on
And it's fading on, it's fading on [instrumental] And the first one tore a picture
of a dead and hanging man
who was kissing foreign fishes
that flew right out from his hands
and when I put my arms around him
felt the blushing blood run through my cheeks
and an eerieness surrounded
when his tongue began to speak
and he said, "oh, boy, you are so pretty
enough to wrap tight in rice-paper string"
and when I finally kissed him
the whole world began to ring
lost like a bell that's tipping over
with two cracks along both sides
and I knew the world was over
so I took a look outside
and watched the fires that were reaching
up to the weather vanes and the tops of trees
and the waiting scene and the Sunday dream
they're all waiting here for me Deli markets with their flower stands
their pretty girls and their burning men
hanging out on the hooks
next to window displays
and I took out my tongue
twice removed from my face
across a bridge and across the mountains
threw a nickel in the fountain
to save my soul from all these troubled times
and all the drugs that I don't have the guts to take
to soothe my mind so I'm always sober
always aching, always heading towards
mass suicide, occult figurines
and wasted gas-station attendants
attending to their jobs
and a nice drive in the country
finds a nice cliff to drop off
oh, when this life just gets so grating
all the grittiness of life but don't take those pills your boyfriend gave you you're too wonderful to die
And the last one tore a picture
from the pornographic page
and all the pleasure points attacking
all the looks of love were staged
and it's a lie that you've been given
that just hurts you every day
so why should I lie here naked
when it's just too far away
from anything we could call loving
any love worth living for
so I'll sleep out in the gutter
you can sleep here on the floor
and when I wake up in the morning
I won't forget to lock the door
'cos with a match that's mean and some gasoline
you won't see me anymore. (instumental) I love you Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ I love you
Yes I do
I love you Jesus Christ Jesus Christ I love you
Yes I do
And on the lazy days The dogs dissolve and drain away
The world it goes
And always waits
The day we are awaiting
Up and over we go through the wave and undertow I will float until I learn how to swim
inside my mother in a garbage bin
until I find myself again again
Up and over we go mouths open wide and spitting still
And I will spit until I learn how to speak
up thru the dorway as the sideboards creek
with them ever proclaiming me me
Up and over we go the weight it sits on down and I don't know
I will shout until they know what I mean
I mean the marriage of a dead dog sing
and a synthetic flying machine, machine ohh ohh ohh ohh
ohh ohh ohh ohh
(okay) There is no dream
So wake up
Run your lips across your fingers till you find
Some scent of yourself that you can hold up high
To remind yourself that you didn't die
On a day that was so crappy
Whole and happy, you're alive And you seem so bruised
And it's beautiful as it's reflecting off from you as it shines
You're in the bathroom carving holiday designs into yourself
Hoping no one will find you but they found you
And they took you
And you somehow survived There is no dream
So wake up
And if the holidays don't hollow out your eyes
Then press yourself against whatever
You find to be beautiful and trembling with life
Because I'm so happy you didn't die "All I perceive is wasted and broken
Silvery streams, sacred when spoken
Slam into me and into the ditch of debris.
And you smoke in the park, you sleep in the greenery,
Everyone barks but all still believing
To tear out your heart would send all your secrets to me, But I let you down,
And swollen and small is where you'll find me now
With that silver stripping off
From my tongue you're tearing out,
And you'll never hear me talk. Your teeth believe that teeth are for tearing
Tear into me and the scent of you sweating
Smells good to me, as long as we keep in our clothes
And out in the dark, the world is still rolling,
Kids in their cars, cigarette smoking
And all that they are, just reeks with the sweetest belief. But I let you down,
And swollen and small is where you'll find me now,
With that silver stripping off
From my tongue you're tearing out,
And you'll never hear me talk. All I could want is silver and spinning
Out from your arms and into the pretty
Pit of your heart - so simply and softly we'd flow. But I let you down,
And swollen and small is where you'll find me now,
With that silver stripping off
From my tongue you're tearing out,
And you'll never hear me talk. Into you I will glow.
Into you." This song was recorded in Jeff's bedroom in Louisiana
when he was 17 years of age. Some of the sounds featured
are his sister playing piano, his mother hearing
sounds from space, the baby brother of Will Cullen Hart talking, a blender,
and the music of Ornette Coleman. Crawl across toward your window
I'm calling softly from the street
Always a lonely widow
half-awake and sleeping on my feet
I'm of age but have no children
No quarter phone booth calls to home
Just late night television
inside my bedroom all alone There is no use in waiting
offer up your steps so I can climb
Show me all your figure paintings
etched in the middle of the night
Let me stretch upon your carpet
let me hear the rain tap on your street
knowing I am safe on the inside
blankets wrapped and drifting off to sleep There are beads that wrap
Around your knees that crackle into the dark
Like a walk in the park, like a hole in your head
Like the feeling you get when you realize you're dead
This time we ride roller coasters into the ocean
We feel no emotion as we spiral down to the world
And I guess it's worth your time
Because there's some lives you live
And some you leave behind
It gets hard to explain
The gardenhead knows my name Leave me alone,
For you know this isn't the first time
In fact this is twice in a row
That the angels have slipped through our landslide
And filled up our garden with snow
And I don't wish to taste of your insides
Or to call out your name through my phone
For the glory boys at your bedside will love you
As long as you're something to own Follow me through a city of frost covered angels
I swear I have nothing to prove
I just want to dance in your tangles
To give me some reason to move
But to take on the world at all angles
Requires a strength I can't use
So I'll meet you up high in your anger
Of all that is hoping and waiting for you (instrumental) Cindy smiles in overcoats
She says, "Please stay a while
Like ice cream floats and dreams
And I will fill your heart with boats and bells
And beams and candy-appled everythings
Bells and beams and candy-appled everythings"
Cindy skips my trampoline
With toys and horns and bouncing things
And even the most silent must sing a song of love
Yes, even the silent they must sing a song of love
Oh, oh Unhappy girl, she's spinning
Through strings in her curls
And it's only the beginning
Of a trip around the world
Cindy, won't you smile?
Cindy, won't you sleep a while?
I feel I'm just a child
Sinking down one hundred million miles
Oh, oh Blistering Pree, all smiling and swollen
Makes babies to breathe
With their hearts hanging open
All over the sheets as soft as beets
In some brown dresser drawer
And with bees in her breath,
And the rest of her ringing
They'll sting through her chest
With a force hard and beating,
'Till wonderfully wet she will get
Until she's soaked inside her clothes.
And there is no sorry to be sorry for,
For a roll around the floor
Some afternoon so sound and soft,
It made her swallow all her sweat
With every bit of breath she coughs,
And when the day it came to pour
All her babies all across the bathroom floor
She will be swimming in them all forever more. Someone is waiting
To swallow all the halos out of you
As your face blows
Through my windows
Sending pieces flying all around the room And I love you
And I want to
Shoot all the superheroes from your skies
Watch them bleeding
From your ceiling
As their empty anger falls out from their eyes
All alone... x2
And on the lazy days the dogs dissolve and drain away,
The world it goes and always waits
The day we are awaiting. All i know
We go through the weight and undertow
I will float until i learn how to swim,
Inside my mother in a garbage bin,
Until i find myself again,
Again, oh. All i know
We go mouths open wide and spit in stuff
I will spit until i learn how to speak
Up through the doorway as the sideboards creak
With them ever proclaiming me, me, oh All i know
We go the way the steps fell down and i dont know,
I will shout until they know what i mean,
I mean the marriage of a dead dog sing
And a synthetic flying machine, machine, oh. Ok. Daddy, please hear this song that I sing
In your heart there's a spark that just screams for a lover to bring
A child to your chest that could lay as you sleep
And love all you have left like your boy used to be long ago, wrapped in sheets warm and wet Blister please with those wings in your spine
Love to be with a brother of mine, how he'd love to find
Your tongue in his teeth in a struggle to find
Secret songs that you keep wrapped in boxes so tight, sounding only at night as you sleep And in my dreams you're alive and you're crying
As your mouth moves in mine, soft and sweet
Rings of flowers 'round your eyes and I'll love you
For the rest of your life when you're ready Brother, see we are one in the same
And you left with your head filled with flames and you watched as your brains
Fell out through your teeth, push the pieces in place, make your smile sweet to see
Don't you take this away, I'm still wanting my face on your cheek And when we break, we'll wait for our miracle
God is a place where some holy spectacle lies
When we break, we'll wait for our miracle
God is a place you will wait for the rest of your life Two-headed boy, she is all you could need
She will feed you tomatoes and radio wires
And retire to sheets safe and clean
But don't hate her when she gets up to leave [instrumental] Crawl across toward your window
I'm calling softly from the street
Always a lonely widow
half-awake and sleeping on my feet
I'm of age but have no children
No quarter phone booth calls to home
Just late night television
inside my bedroom all alone There is no use in waiting
offer up your steps so I can climb
Show me all your figure paintings
etched in the middle of the night
Let me stretch upon your carpet
let me hear the rain tap on your street
knowing I am safe on the inside
blankets wrapped and drifting off to sleep My dream girl don't exist
And at the age of five she slit her wrists
She didn't know that i'de be hanging around
So her parents buried her in the ground
This day i can still hear the sound
Of a life in outer space My dream girl don't exist
It just you and i and this tv
And this illness seems to feel so strange
Like a hench man that's about to hang
The moon, up like a ball and chain And the weight is waiting off
Feel the world so real and strung My dream girl don't exist
Just a photograph in a history book
And i beleive she had a voice and name
Three children on the coast of maine
Her life was in a hurricane
Of love and real embrace My dream girl don't exist
And at the age of five she slit her wrists
She didn't know that i'de be hanging around
So one day she took a strole to town
And walked infront of a greyhound
Bound for new york central state And the weight is waiting off
And the weight is waiting off
Fell the world so real and strung
She know, and knows she knows
She'll never be afraid Sailing through
Your disease and you. your disease and you
Your body like a basket
Shivering in static for us in this place of angry tears
All those years you were alive inside the closet
But nobody in it there but me
But now you are coming
Life is off running
You're tearing yourself apart at the seams
And You are a liar You are a liar
You are a liar and you are a lie
You are a liar
You are a liar
Now I'm off sailing
Sickness inhaling
Every drop of blood you could bleed
The world is all coming
They're Coming of millions
The billions of people to sick to believe
And I really wanted just to be in your body
To be in your body
To be inside you
I really wanted to be in your body
To share in your sickness
The shield around you
You are a liar You are a liar
You are a liar and you are a lie
You are a liar You are a liar
You are a liar and you are a liar
Wrapped you up in masters
They Cover you in plaster
They Spit in your mouth and then say I love you
Is this supposed to save us
Is this supposed to break us
Into the toilet without faces removed
And I really wanted just be in your body
If i could only be in your body
If i could only be inside you
I really wanted to be in your body
Into the toilet with faces removed
You are a liar You are a liar
You are a liar and you are a lie
You are a liar You are a liar
You are a liar and you are a lie
You are a liar You are a liar
You are a liar and you are a lie
You are a liar you are a liar
And you are a liar Daddy please hear this song that I sing
In your heart there's a spark that just screams
For a lover to bring a child to your chest that could lay as you sleep
And love all you have left like your boy used to be
Long ago wrapped in sheets warm and wet Blister please with those wings in your spine
Love to be with a brother of mine
How he'd love to find your tongue in his teeth
In a struggle to find secret songs that you keep wrapped in boxes so tight
Sounding only at night as you sleep And in my dreams you're alive and you're cryin'
As your mouth moves in mine soft and sweet
Rings of flowers round your eyes and I love you
For the rest of your life in your Brother see we are one in the same
And you left with your head filled with flames
And you watched as your brains fell out through your teeth
Push the pieces in place, make your smile sweet to see
Don't you take this away, I'm still wanting my face on your cheek And when we break we'll wait for our miracle
God is a place where some holy spectacle lies
When we break we'll wait for our miracle
God is a place you will wait for the rest of your life Two headed boy, she is all you could need
She will feed you tomatoes and radio wires
And retire to sheets safe and clean
But don't hate her when she gets up to leave When you were young
You were the king of carrot flowers
And how you built a tower tumbling through the trees
In holy rattlesnakes that fell all around your feet And your mom would stick a fork right into daddy's shoulder
And your dad would throw the garbage all across the floor
As we would lay and learn what each other's bodies were for And this is the room
One afternoon I knew I could love you
And from above you how I sank into your soul
Into that secret place where no one dares to go And your mom would sink until she was no longer speaking
And dad would dream of all the different ways to die
Each one a little more than he could dare to try She comes to me
Whenever I am locked inside my room
Buried in the tune that I call love She sings to me, the words I cannot hear
But then, the melody's so clear it makes me cry
Her love is so beautiful
Her love is so real, it smells like glue She's leaving me to find a place she never will call home
I stand shaking like a stone
And smile inside She's calling me to come to her and curl inside her womb
I hear lies, acid too
But I won't die, the pain is so beautiful
The urge is so real, it smells like glue And I will scream, she hears me
I will tell myself she loves me
And all the lies and fears
Will stick to me like glue And I will scream, she hears me
I will tell myself she loves me
And all the lies and fears
Will stick to me like glue The lady is dying
She bends back like a wave
As her spirit is climbing
Through the hospital wall and away
Then I wanted to hold you
As you made your escape
But now I should have told you
When your eyes were alive and away
Always in life we all must make this bloodstain
And so I go it alone
And the pressure is great
I hold onto my own
Oh please oh don't go away
And I wanted to know you
Before you started to fade
But I gave everything to
A lie and a farce and a fake
Always in life we all must make this bloodstain
And so I go it alone
And the pressure is great
I hold onto my own
Oh please oh don't go away
I'd like to see you when all of these angry days blow away Speaker 1: I was off in a forest somewhere, I don't know where, but, somewhere and I was sitting on top of this huge tree and I don't know how I got there like that tree way over there that's just this little tiny twaint, and I was just sitting on it and I was afraid to move and I moved and the tree just bent with me and that was weird. Speaker 2: That's cool. Your love is like a building
Pushing up towards the sky
I just wanna climb your tower
To your dress like apple pie Oh I love you on a Tuesday
Oh I love you on a Tuesday moon
Let's dribble hand on my perfume I am changing colors daily
Jumping to my postbox
While everything's exploding baby
In your dress I'll sleep a while Oh its flying toward some Tuesday
Oh its flying toward some Tuesday moon
Into the air like a balloon
She's taking scissors to her wing
It's shrinking diesel through my room
With no arms and legs, can you dig?
Can you dig it? Your love is like a drunken stuper
Falling into push paper holes
Into my insides I scoop her
Burning up her real time flows Oh I love you on a Tuesday
Oh I love you on a Tuesday moon
Let's dribble hand on my perfume
Let's dribble hand on my perfume
Let's dribble hand on my perfume

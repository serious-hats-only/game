It could all be so simple
But you'd rather make it hard
Loving you is like a battle
And we both end up with scars
Tell me, who I have to be
To get some reciprocity
See no one loves you more than me
And no one ever will Is this just a silly game?
That forces you to act this way
Forces you to scream my name
Then pretend that you can't stay
Tell me, who I have to be
To get some reciprocity
See no one loves you more than me
And no one ever will No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't workin'
It ain't workin'
It ain't workin'
And when I try to walk away
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy
This is crazy
This is crazy
This is crazy I keep letting you back in
How can I explain myself?
As painful as this thing has been
I just can't be with no one else
See I know what we've got to do
You let go and I'll let go too
'Cause no one's hurt me more than you
And no one ever will No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't workin'
It ain't workin'
It ain't workin'
It ain't workin'
And when I try to walk away
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy
This is crazy
This is crazy
This is crazy Care for me, care for me
I know you care for me
There for me, there for me
Said, "You'd be there for me"
Cry for me, cry for me
You said, "You'd die for me"
Give to me, give to me
Why won't you live for me Care for me, care for me
You said, "You care for me"
There for me, there for me
Said, "You'd be there for me"
Cry for me, cry for me
You said, "You'd die for me"
Give to me, give to me
Why won't you live for me Care for me, care for me
You said, "You care for me"
There for me, there for me
Said, "You'd be there for me"
Cry for me, cry for me
You said, "You'd die for me"
Give to me, give to me
Why won't you live for me Care for me, care for me
You said, "You care for me"
There for me, there for me
Said, "You'd be there for me"
Give to me, give to me
Why won't you live for me
Cry for me, cry for me
You said, "You'd die for me" (Where were you) (When I needed you) [Tanya Blount:]
Why should I feel discouraged
Why should the shadows come
Why should my heart feel lonely
And long for heaven and home When Jesus is my portion
A constant friend is he
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know he watches over me
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know he watches me [Lauryn Hill:]
I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I'm free
His eye is on the sparrow And I know he watches
[Tanya:] He watches me

[Tanya:] I know he watches

One day you'll understand... zion
Unsure of what the balance held
I touched my belly overwhelmed
By what i had been chosen to perform
But then an angel came one day
Told me to kneel down and pray
For unto me a man child would be born
Woe this crazy circumstance
I knew his life deserved a chance
But everybody told me to be smart
"look at your career " they said,
"lauryn baby use your head."
But instead i chose to use my heart
Now the joy... of my world...
Is in zion! (zion, zion!)
Now the joy... of my world...
Is in zion! (zion, uhh, zion!)
How beautiful if nothing more
Than to wait at zion's door
I've never been in love like this before
Now let me pray to keep you from
The perils that will surely come
See life for you my prince has just begun
And i thank you for choosing me
To come through unto life to be
A beautiful reflection of his grace
See i know that a gift so great
Is only one god could create
And i'm reminded every time i see your face
That the joy... (joy) of my world... (world)
Is in zion! (is in zion) i said zion! (is in zion)

Singin' my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
telling my whole life with his words
killing me softly with his song
I heard he sang a good song
I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him
And listen for a while
And there he was this young boy
A stranger to my eyes
Strummin' my pain with his fingers
Singin' my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
telling my whole life with his words
killing me softly with his song
I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters
And read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on
Strummin' my pain with his fingers
(One time, one time)
Singin' my life with his words
(Two times, two times)
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song

Yo, my men and my women
Don't forget about the deen, Sirat al-Mustaqeem
Yo, it's about a thing
If ya feel real good wave your hands in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere! It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you ain't hear him, then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again Guys you know you'd better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men, come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (Like you got yen!)
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of they three or four kids
And they face a court case when the child support late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky, silent men
The punk, domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
Come again Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out Girls you know you'd better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about

Light of day The sweetest thing, I've ever known
Was like the kiss on the collarbone
Soft caress of happiness
The way you walk, your style of dress I wish I didn't get so weak
Ooh baby, just to hear you speak
Makes me argue just to see
How much you're in love with me
See, like a queen, a queen upon her throne It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know I get mad when you walk away
(Don't walk away)
So I tell you leave, when I mean stay
Warm as the sun dipped in black Fingertips on the small of my back
More valuable than all I own
Like your precious, precious
Precious, precious dark skin tone It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know It was the, ah, I tried to explain
Ah, but baby, it's in vain Speaking on my mother's phone
The touch that makes me think I'm grown
(You ain't grown) Sweet prince of the ghetto, your kisses taste like amaretto
Intoxicating, oh, so intoxicating
How sad, how sad that all things come to an end
But then again, I'm, I'm not alone It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know Ah, sometimes watch you in your sleep
Ah, excuse me if I get to deep
(Ha) It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know

I wanna give you some good, good loving Good, good, good loving
(I wanna give you some good loving) Take it down now
I loved hard one but the love wasnt in return
I found out the man i die for he wasnt even concerned
Time will turn you tried to burn like a perm
But my eyes saw the deception but ma' heart couldnt let me learn
For, some little mug was i
Every time he lied he would cry and then id die
My heart must of died a thousand deaths
Compare my self to Tony Braxton thought id never catch my breate
Nothing left you stole the heart beating from my chest
I tried to call the cops that type of thing they cant arrest
Pay supressed will lead to cardiac arrest
I must deserve it cus' he convinced me i was not blessed
But my people would protest told the line of buisness cus' ma s**t was complex
Mornings just a sex i was blessed but couldnt feel it like when i was caressed
I spent nights touching my breast overwhelmed by gods zest
I was god bleesed contimplating destistating mess
And no man has ever worked in paradise, no man has ever worked in paradise, And no man has ever worked in paradise Where were you when i needed you, when i needed you, when i needed you
Where were you when i needed you, when i needed you, when i needed you
oh do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do I get out
I get out of all your boxes
I get out
You can't hold me in these chains
I'll get out Father, free me from this bondage
Knowin' my condition is the reason I must change
Your stinkin' resolution is no type of solution
Preventin' me from freedom, maintainin' your pollution I won't support your lie no more, I won't even try no more
If I have to die, oh Lord, that's how I choose to live
I won't be compromised no more, I can't be victimised no more
I just don't sympathize no more 'Cuz now I understand, you just wanna use me
You say love, then abuse me
You never thought you'd loose me
But how quickly we forget that nothin' is for certain You thought I'd stay here hurtin'
Your guilt trip's just not workin'
Repressin' me to death 'cuz now I'm choosin' life, yo
I take the sacrifice, yo, if everything must go, then go
That's how I choose to live That's how I choose to live
No more compromises, I see past your diguises
Blindin' through mind control, stealin' my eternal soul
Appealin' through material to keep me as your slave But I get out
Oh, I get out of all your boxes
I get out
Oh, you can't hold me in these chains
I'll get out
Oh, I want out of social bondage
Knowin' my condition

Oh, and you ain't seen nothin' yet
Oh, I don't care if you're upset
I could care less if you're upset See, it don't change the truth and your hurt feeling's no excuse
To keep me in this box, psychological locks
Repressin' true expression, cementin' this repression
Promotin' mass deception, so that no one can be healed I don't respect your system
I won't protect your system
When you talk, I don't listen
Oh, let my Father's will be done And just get out
Oh, just get out of all these bondage
Just get out
Oh, you can't hold me in these chains
Just get out
All these traditions killin' freedom
Knowin' my condition
Is the reason I must change I just accepted what you said, keepin' me among the dead
The only way to know is to walk, then learn and grow
But faith is not your speed
Oh, you've had everyone believe That you're the sole authority
Just follow the majority
Afraid to face reality
The system is a joke Oh, you'd be smart to save your soul
Oh, and escape this mind control
You spent your life in sacrifice
To a system for the dead Oh, are you sure?
Where is the passion in this living?
Are you sure, it's God you servin'?
Obligated to a system, getting less than you're deserving Who made up these schools, I say?
Who made up these rules, I say?
Animal conditioning
Oh, just to keep us as a slave Oh, just get out
Of this social purgatory
Just get out
All these traditions are alive
Just get out
Superstition killing freedom

Just get out uh uh uh uh refugee camp, conspireacy theory, what what, yo You're just too good to be true
can't take my eyes off of you
you'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
at long last love has arrived
and I thank God I'm alive
you're just too good to be true
can't take my eyes off of you Pardon the way that I stare
there's nothing else to compare
the sight of you leaves me weak
there are no words left to speak
but if you feel like I feel
please let me know that it's real
you're just too good to be true
can't take my eyes off of you chorus:
I need you baby and if it's quite alright
I need you baby to warm the lonely nights
I love you baby, trust in me when I say:ok(its okaay)
Oh pretty baby, don't let me down, I pray
oh pretty baby, now that I've found you, stay
and let me love you, o baby, let me love you, o baby You're just too good to be true
can't take my eyes off of you
you'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
at long last love has arrived
and I thank God I'm alive
you're just too good to be true
can't take my eyes off of you chorus:
I need you baby and if it's quite alright
I need you baby to warm the lonely nights
I love you baby, trust in me when I say its ok
Oh pretty baby, don't let me down, I pray
oh pretty baby, now that I've found you, stay
and let me love you, o baby, let me love you, o babyy I need you baby and if it's quite alright
I love you baby, you warm the lonely nights
I need you baby, trust in me when I say its ok
Oh, oh pretty baby, don't let me down, I pray
oh pretty baby, now that I've found you, stay
and let me love you... (fades away) It's funny how money change a situation
Miscommunication leads to complication
My emancipation don't fit your equation
I was on the humble, you on every station
Some wan' play young Lauryn like she dumb
But remember not a game new under the sun
Everything you did has already been done
I know all the tricks from Bricks to Kingston
My thing done made your kingdom wan' run
Now understand L. Boogie's non-violent
But if a thing test me, run for me gun
Can't take a threat to me newborn son
L's been this way since creation
A groupie call, you fall from temptation
Now you wanna ball over separation
Tarnish my image in your conversation
Who you gon' scrimmage, like you the champion
You might win some but you just lost one You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one Now, now how come your talk turn cold
Gained the whole world for the price of your soul
Tryin' to grab hold of what you can't control
Now you're all floss, what a sight to behold
Wisdom is better than silver and gold
I was hopeless now I'm on Hope road
Every man wants to act like he's exempt
Need to get down on his knees and repent
Can't slick talk on the day of judgement
Your movement's similar to a serpent
Tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?
Consequence is no coincidence
Hypocrites always want to play innocent
Always want to take it to the full out extent
Always want to make it seem like good intent
Never want to face it when it's time for punishment
I know you don't wanna hear my opinion
But there come many paths and you must choose one
And if you don't change then the rain soon come
See you might win some but you just lost one You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one You might win some but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come
When it's all done did you really gain from
What you done done, it's so silly how come
You just lost one
Now don't you understand man universal law
What you throw out comes back to you, star
Never underestimate those who you scar
Cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard
You can't hold God's people back that long
The chain of Shatan wasn't made that strong
Trying to pretend like your word is your bond
But until you do right, all you do will go wrong
Now some might mistake this for just a simple song
And some don't know what they have 'til it's gone
Now even when you're gone you can still be reborn
And, from the night can arrive the sweet dawn
Now some might listen and some might shun
And some may think that they've reached perfection
If you look closely you'll see what you've become
Cause you might win some but you just lost one You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one You might win some but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come
When it's all done did you really gain from
What you done done, it's so silly how come

Consumerism [Hook] Yo heh heh tell him it's like uhh you know uhh
Sweet sweet SWEET tell him
Let me be patient let me be kind
Make me unselfish without being blind
Though I may suffer I'll envy it not
And endure what comes
Cause he's all that I got and
Tell him...
Tell him I need him Tell him I love him And it'll be alright
Background singing Telll himmm be alright be alright
Tell him tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
It'll be alright
Now I may have faith to make mountains fall
But if I lack love then I am nothin' at all
I can give away everything I possess
But left without love then I have no happiness
I know I'm imperfect & not without sin [& not without sin]
But now that I'm older all childish things end
And tell him...
Tell him I need him Tell him I love him And it'll be alright
Background singing Telll himmm be alright be alright
Tell him tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
It'll be alright
Bridge
I'll never be jealous
And I won't be too proud
Cause love is not boastful
Oooh and love is not loud
Tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
Everything's gonna be alright Ieee iee ieee iee iee iee iee iee
Now I may have wisdom and knowledge on Earth
But if I speak wrong then what is it worth?
See what we now know is nothing compared
To the love that was shown when our lives were spared
And tell him...
Tell him I need him Tell him I love him And it'll be alright
Background singing Telll himmm be allright be alright
Tell him tell him I need him

What is meant to be, will be
After winter, must come spring
Change, it comes eventually
Everything is everything What is meant to be, will be
After winter, must come spring
Change, it comes eventually
I wrote these words for everyone
Who struggles in their youth
Who won't accept deception
Instead of what is truth
It seems we lose the game,
Before we even start to play
Who made these rules? We're so confused
Easily led astray
Let me tell ya that Everything is everything Everything is everything
After winter, must come spring
Everything is everything
I philosophy
Possibly speak tongues
Beat drum, Abyssinian, street Baptist
Rap this in fine linen
From the beginning
My practice extending across the atlas
I begat this
Flippin' in the ghetto on a dirty mattress
You can't match this rapper / actress
More powerful than two Cleopatras
Bomb graffiti on the tomb of Nefertiti
MCs ain't ready to take it to the Serengeti
My rhymes is heavy like the mind of Sister Betty
L. Boogie spars with stars and constellations
Then came down for a little conversation Adjacent to the king, fear no human being
Roll with cherubims to Nassau Coliseum Now hear this mixture Where hip hop meets scripture
Develop a negative into a positive picture
Now, everything is everything What is meant to be, will be
After winter, must come spring
Change, it comes eventually
Sometimes it seems
We'll touch that dream But things come slow or not at all
And the ones on top, won't make it stop
So convinced that they might fall
Let's love ourselves then we can't fail To make a better situation
Tomorrow, our seeds will grow
All we need is dedication
Let me tell ya that,
Everything is everything Everything is everything
After winter, must come spring
Everything is everything
Everything is everything
What is meant to be, will be
After winter, must come spring
Change, it comes eventually When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)
When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)
Why's it feel so good? (when it hurts so bad)

When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)

Why's it feel so good? (when it hurts so bad)

I loved real real hard once
But the love wasn't returned
Found out the man i'd die for
He wasn't even concerned
I tried, and i tried, and i tried
To keep him in my life (to keep him in my life)
I cried, and i cried, and i cried
But i couldn't make it right
But i, i loved the young man
And if you ever been in love
Then you'd understand
That what you want might make you cry
What you need might pass you by
If you don't catch it (if you don't catch it)
(if you don't catch it)
And what you need ironically Will turn out what you want to be
If you just let it (if you just let it)
If you just let it (if you just let it)
See, i thought this feeling
It was all that i had
But how could this be love
And make me feel so bad? (gave up my power)
Gave up my power
I existed for you
But who-ever knew
The voo-doo you'd do
But i, i loved the young man
And if you ever been in love
Then you'd understand
What you want might make you cry
What you need might pass you by
If you don't catch it (if you don't, you don't)
(if you don't, you don't) And what you need ironically
Will turn out what you want to be
If you just let it (if you don't, you don't)
If you just let it (if you don't, you don't)
See what you want might make you cry
What you need might pass you by
If you don't catch it (if you don't, you don't)
(if you don't, you don't)
And what you need ironically
Will turn out what you want to be
If you just let it

So bad (when it hurts so bad)
(when it hurts so bad)
(when it hurts so bad) Yeah, yeah, yeah hey, yeah hey, yeah hey See the road to hell is paved with good intentions
Can't you tell the way they have to mention
How they've helped you out, you're such a hopeless victim
Please don't do me any favors, Mr Intentional All their talk is seasoned to perfection
The road they walk, commanding your affection
They need to be needed, deceived by motivation
An opportunity, to further situation Why they so important is without explanation
Please don't patronize me, Mr Intentional
Oh, oh, oh oh We give rise to ego by being insecure
The advice that we go desperately searching for
The subconscious effort to support our paramour
To engage in denial, to admit we're immature Validating lies, Mr Intentional, oh
Open up yours eyes, Mr Intentional Stuck in a system that seeks to suck your blood
Held emotionally hostage by what everybody does
Counting all the money that you give them just because
Exploiting ignorance in the name of love Stop before you drop because that's just the way it works
Please don't justify me, Mr Intentional
Oh one dimensional, Mr Intentional
Oh, oh don't you do me any favors
Oh, oh, oh oh Wake up you've been sleeping
Take up your bed and walk
Stop blaming other people
Oh it's nobody else's fault Accept the truth about you
You know that life goes on without you
And your expensive misinventions
Disguising your intentions Don't worship my hurt feelings, Mr Intentional
Oh, oh oh oh
See I know you can't help me, Mr Intentional The only help I need to live, is unprofessional
The only wealth I have to give, is not material
And if you need much more than that, I'm not available Please don't entertain me, Mr Intentional
Oh I don't need your sympathy, Mr Intentional
Stay away from me, Mr Intentional
So one dimensional, Mr Promotional, Mr Emotional, Mr Intentional
Oh oh, oh Hola! Soy Celia Cruz
Y estoy aqui con Wyclef, celebrando el Carnival
Azucar!
(singing) Guantanamera
(Wyclef) We out here in Miami just shining
(singing) Guajila, Guantanamera
(Wyclef) Worldwide
(singing) Guan-tana-mera
(Wyclef) Bout to bring it to you in stereo
(singing) Guajila, Guantanamera
Yo soy un hombre sincero
(Wyclef) That was then, this is now
Welcome to the Carnival, the arrival... c'mon! (Wyclef Jean)
Spanish Harlem! Oahh-eee-ohh!
Boogie Down Bronx! Oahh-eee-ohh!
Manhattan! Oahh-eee-ohh!
Back to Staten! Oahh-eee-ohh! (Wyclef sings, then raps)
Guantanamera
Hey yo I'm standing at the bar with a, Cuban cigar
Guajila, Guantanamera
Hey, yo, I think she's eyeing me from afar
Guan-tana-mera...
Guajila Guan-tana-mera... Verse One: Wyclef Jean Yo, I wrote this in Haiti, overlooking Cuba
I asked her what's her name, she said, 'Guantanamera'
Remind me of an old latin song, my uncle used to play
On his old forty-five when he used to be alive
She went from a young girl, to a grown woman
Like a Virgin, so she sex with no average mahn
Peep the figure, move like a caterpillar
Fly like a butterfly, let your soul feel her glide
Pac Woman better yet Space Invader
If your name was Chun-Li, we'd be playin Street Fighter
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for your kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me Chorus: Guantanamera
Hey yo, I'm standin at the bar with a, Cuban cigar
Guajila, Guantanamera
Yo, I think she's eyeing me from afar 
Guan-tana-mera...
Guajila Guan-tana-mera... (singing in Spanish, with Wyclef responses)
Soy una mujer, sincera
Do you speak English?
De donde crecen las palmas
Can I buy you a drink?
(man joins in) Soy una mujer, sincera
Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
De donde crecen las palmas
You killin me
Y antes de morir, yo quiero
Cantar mis versos del alma
Te quiero mama, te quiero! Guantanamera
Aiyyo I'm standing at the bar with a, Cuban cigar
Guajila, Guantanamera
Hey yo John Forte, she's eyeing me from far
Guan-tana-mera...
Guajila Guan-tana-mera Verse Two: Lauryn Hill Yo, she was a rose in Spanish Harlem, mamasita beg your pardon
Make stakes at a faster rate then she fornicates
Pure traits of genius, Goddess of Black Venus
Crab niggaz angry cause they can't get between us
to no sele-xion, smooth complex-ion
The lexicon of Lexington, parents came from Cuba
Part Mexican, pure sweet, dimes fell to her feet
She like Movado, and shook her hips like Delgado
And broke niggaz down from the Grounds to Apollo
and then some, she took her act sent it to? demp sum?
And waited patiently while the businessmen come
Call late on purpose, got even politicians nervous
And made plans to infiltrate the street secret service
This gentle flower, fertility was her power
Sweet persona, Venus Flytrap primadonna
Que sera que sera she turned dinero to dinera (Wyclef responds to singing again)
Guantanamera
Hey yo I'm standing at the bar with a, Cuban cigar
Guajila Guantanamera
Hey yo... I think she's eyein me from afar
Guan-tana-mera...
Guajila Guan-tana-mera... Black Rage
Founded on 2/3 a person
Rapings and beatings,
suffering worsens
Black human packages tied up in strings
Black Rage comes from all these types of things Black Rage founded on blatant denial
Scream economics, subsistent survival
Deafening silence, social control
Black Rage is founded on wounds in the soul When the dogs bite
When the bees sing
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember all these kind of things And then I don't fear so bad... Black rage is founded who fed us self hatred
Lies and abuse while we waited and waited
Spiritual treason
This grid and it's cages
Black rage was founded on these kinds of things Black rage is founded on draining and draining
Threatening your freedom
To stop your complaining
Poisoning your water
While they say it's raining
Then call you mad
For complaining, complaining
Old time bureaucracy
Drugging the youth
Black rage is founded on blocking the truth
Murder and crime
Compromise and distortion
Sacrifice, sacrifice
Who makes this fortune?
Greed, falsely called progress
Such human contortion
Black rage is founded on these kinds of things So when the dog bites
And the bee stings
And I'm feeling sad
I simply remember all these kinds of things
And then I don't fear so bad Free enterprise
Is it myth or illusion
Forcing you back into purposed confusion
Black human trafficking
Or blood transfusion
Black rage is founded on these kinds of things
Victims of violence
Both psyche and body
Life out of context is living ungodly
Politics, politics
Greed falsely called wealth
Black rage is founded on denying of self So when the dog bites
And the beatings
And I'm feeling so sad
I simply remember all these kinds of things
And then I don't feel so bad Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't As I look at what I've done
The type of life that I've lived
How many things I pray Father will forgive
One situation involved a young man
He was the ocean and I was the sand
He stole my heart like a thief in the night
Dulled my senses and blurred my sight (And i used to love him)
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't I chose a road of passion and pain
Sacrificed too much and waited in vain
Gave up my power ceased being queen
Addicted to love like the drug of a fiend Torn and confused wasted and used
Reached the crossroad which path would I choose
Stuck and frustrated I waited debated
For something to happen that just wasn't fated
Thought what I wanted was something I needed
When momma said no I just should have heeded
Misled I bled till the poison was gone
And out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't Father you saved me and showed me that life
Was much more than being some foolish man's wife
Showed me that love was respect and devotion
Greater than planets deeper than oceans
My soul was weary but now it's replenished
Content because that part of my life is finished I see him sometimes and I look in his eyes
Is one of a man who's lost treasures untold
But my heart is gold I took back my soul
And totally let my creator control
The life which was his to begin with Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
(Repeat to end) You all doin' alright? You ok? I'm not screamin at ya, I'm just askin you a question. Y'all givin' me a clap. A yes is fine (laughing) ok? (voice from audience "I love that song") Thank you. Praise God. I tell you, I know everybody's in the same mess. I'm telling you. We all are. I know that, you know, and I'm just, you know, I'll be the first to tell you, you know, I'm a mess and God is dealing with me everyday. And everyday I'm trying, you know, how I can be less of a mess. Cuz you know, he showed me, Look Lauryn, you know, You're the problem, ok, I'm going to show you how you're causing the problem, and now I want you to be the solution. And that's what all of these songs are about, just, problem, cause and solution. Free your mind. It's like, we all think that the gospel is join and church building, and that's deception, you know. The real gospel is Repent, which means 'let go of all that crap,' that's killin' ya. Life was supposed to be a pleasurable experience, not this torment, you know. And when I realized that I was tormenting myself, it was about my lust. It wasn't about things that I needed it was just, you know, all these security blankets. I mean, the more I acquired I became more of a prisoner. I mean, you know, forty people on staff, and you can't do nothing, and now creativity is impossible because all you can think about is all these folks that you know, you're supporting and carryin' and you know, it's not good. You know, everybody...a friend of mine says that every tub has to stand on it's own bottom, you know. And in that respect, we all get to do what our passion is. See that's what praisin God is all about, is doing your passion. You know, it's not useless, worthless ritual, you know, monotonous ritual, where we just show up and can't wait to see the game, you know. It's doing your passion and fulfilling your passion. You know. That's how we're thankful. That's how we say we appreciate the opportunity to be alive. And I'm just glad that I, you know, I don't have to slave anymore. You know, cuz I, music was my love, and because of everything I thought had to accompany my music it became my burden. It just got stolen from me. I said, What is this? How did this thing that I love so much so easily and so quickly turn to something I loath and hate? And so now, you know, I understand that it was because I was measuring myself or trying to compare myself to a standard that wasn't reality. It wasn't the standard at all, you know. There's a scripture in the Bible that we, what does it say, it says 'We compare ourselves amongst ourselves' you know. That's not the standard. You already are the standard. What are you trying to fit into a standard for? We were each created to be individual standards, you know. And we're trying to fit into a standard? It doesn't make any sense, you know. So now I'm just, you know, after all that, I'm just ready to be me. And it's a lot to work through, you know, because all of us have hidden in these little boxes purposely, because of parts of ourselves that we were unhappy about. And it's because we didn't understand, you know, because there's all this social doctrine that says, you know, that the infinite God, with all this expression, who created every single one of us, absolutely different, on purpose, wants everybody to fit into the same suit. But like, you know, that's deception. That's deception. (Talking to someone offstage) Ok, let me just, I think this is the wrong one (laughing) I don't think this is the right one. We took...we were in, um, Florida this weekend and we took the kids to Disneyworld, and um, you know we were going, they gave us a tour. They escorted us through the back. And when they escorted us through the back, we got to see how, you know, there all these people workin all hard, and it was like, real dirty back there, and of course, in the front it was all immaculately clean. And I said, I said, you know, People need to see the reality, they need to see, you know, how these people slave to maintain this illusion. And it felt like my life. I said, If people only knew what it was. It's like, you know, a bunch of musicians, listen, bustin' their 'mm' workin all hard to make it look easy. What's the point? You know, Oh, uh, I just threw this together, uh...(audience laughs). You know, it's like, you know what I'm sayin? I mean, you know. Slaving. Slaving to act like, you know, I wake up like this. And none of us do, you know, none of us do. None of us do. And reality is good cuz that means everybody could just exhale, let your belly out, you know, and chill. You know. But people get mad at me when I say, Look, let's stop frontin'. And I'm saying, you know, that's the blessing. Now we can go around and look at each other and say, Oh, you got one too?! And be free. And we want to defend the curse. I'll tell ya, that was not fun. Did it for a long time. Too long. (offstage) You didn't find it? It's another white one. But you see...in my purse. Or the, the other bag? Or the green one? Ghetto. You know, it's reality, ok (laughing)? One time, it came to me, you know, I was just told very concretely. You know, it was like that voice, the right one, said to me, he said, Lauryn, You know the real you is more interesting than the fake somebody else. I just want you to know that. Because we always thought we could get, you know, we could get reality by just putting on the clothes and wearin' the face and you know, lookin hard in the video. But, you know. Reality is.it's like I've always told to my husband, it's like, look, you know, we look at Bob Marley, you know, and we say Ok, let's just grow locks and wear the clothes and have the band and we have no many idea how many years of struggle and pain and suffering that made that content. You see what I'm saying? You can't get it from the outside in. Truth is from the inside out. You know, and the way we've been trying to heal and be healed is with these topical, surface, superficial, temporary solution. And I'm telling you, true healing is from the inside out. You know, we've been told to protect our outer man while our inner man is dying. (offstage) Oh, this is the one. Boy I'll tell ya, God made him for me. I'm something to put up with. And to endure that is amazing. I'll be the first to tell you, trust me. Y'all could clap cuz that's some real work (more clapping). I was in there in the room, you know, before we came out here, and he said to me, I said, Ro should I change? And he said, Yeah. So I looked at him, I said, Why did you tell me to change I was comfortable, man. But I asked him the question. So I went in the room and I tried on all these clothes and I was like, I feel like an idiot. So I pulled out all these clothes and I'm sayin, ok Ro, you know, Pack the bag neatly, you know, Could you put the clothes back in? And he's like, Alright. So he's trying to do this but then I'm like, No! Now take this out! Now put that back and take that out! Put that back, hold that, take, that, put, The orange shoe! The orange shoe! So I'm like. And then after awhile I just said, Ro baby, could you leave? Please get out the room. And I just put back on the clothes I came in. Ok, I was like...I'm just not there anymore. Nah, I'm telling you. It's like, uh (laughing). Hey you know he's learned. Because before we used to just beef and now he's like, Okay...I'm out. It's real. God gave us a brand new relationship, man, I mean, one in truth, you know. It's like, we date people, like let's say, you know, we're interested in somebody and we put on the perfume and dress up and then we do things that we will never ever ever do again! You understand what I'm sayin? It's like...And that's why so many marriages end up in divorce. It's because people wake up next to a stranger. They say, Who the hell are you? What are you doing in this bed? Where's that man that used to do 'du, dua, and du.' And I'm sayin let's give them reality from the door because...you're going to attract love, and the one that really loves you. And then you don't have to pretend and falcify, and you know, keep that posture. You know, you know, I can't, I'm just like... I'll never forget when I first met him I said to him, it was like, he saw me eating in front of him, and he told me, he was like, You eat like a man, you must not like me. You know, because, women, usually they keep that posture. And I said, Nah. I said it's not even that, you know. It's but, this is reality. This is, you know, and that's it, man, I mean, I'm just telling you, it's so wonderful to finally find...And trust me, it's a work in progress, it's not something that happens overnight. We all have to be introduced to each other. I'm telling you, I know that I'm up here and you see, Lauryn Hill, you came to see Lauryn Hill. But this is the first time y'all meet me. You see what I'm saying? Don't think you met me before, ok. And as I grow, you're going to meet me a little bit more. You're gonna be exposed to the real me a little bit more. I can tell you I had to reintroduce myself to everybody I know. My mother my father. Listen, y'all never knew me. I want to introduce you to me. I'm just getting to know me. And you know what, anything that's not growin is dead, so we better be changing. You know, people would say to me, they would hold me hostage. And they, seriously, emotionally hostage, and they'd say, Uh, she's changing. The money's changing her. And I'd say Listen, the money's not changing me, God's changing me. I'm changing, because that's a natural part of life. We're all supposed to change. Who wakes up and is the same way tomorrow and the day after that? Nobody is. Let the experience teach you and be real, man. And, um.there's gonna be warfare involved. Because there's some people who prefer deceptions, see. They say, uh, I don't like this new expression, and I say, what, you want two-thirds of me to stay outside? I'm a whole person. You can't say, you know, two-thirds of Lauryn, come in here. Only two-thirds is acceptable. I'm a whole person. You know. And that's everybody. You always talk about spiritual warfare and we did N't realize that it was in relationships. It's emotional warfare. Being able to tell the people we love the most the truth about ourselves. And when they say, Hey that doesn't fit into our box for you, we say, Well, I ain't in no box. Don't try to put me in one. I'm going to play a little bit of guitar with this one, but I might stop it's cuz I really want you to listen to the words, so if I stop, you understand why. I want you to really hear the words... Everybody knows that they're guilty
Everybody knows that they've lied
Everybody knows that they're guilty
Resting on their conscious eating their insides
Its Freedom

Its Freedom

Time to get free
Oh, give yourselves up now
Its Freedom Said, its freedom time yall
There's a war in the mind
For the territory over dominion
Who will dominate opinions
Schizims and isms
Keeping us in forms of religion
Conforming our vision
To the wolrd church's decision
Trapped in a section
Submitted to committee elections
Moral infection
Epidemic Lies and deception
Insurrection
Of the higest possible order
Distorting our tape recorders
From hearing like under water
Beyond the borders
Finding sin in disorder
Bound by the strategy
And systemic depravity
Heavy as gravity
Head first in the cavity
Without a bottom
A fate worse than Sodom
What's got 'em drunk off the spirit?
Truth comes and we can't hear it
And you've been programmed to fear it
I had a vision
I was falling in indecision
Appalling
Calling religion some program on television
How can dominant wisdom
Be recognized in a system
Of anti-christs and majority rules
Intelligent Fools
PhDs of ilusions
Masters of mass confusion
Bachelors of Past illusions
Now, who you choosing?
The head or the tail?
The Bloodshed or the Male?
Or confidence in the veil?
Conferences at Yale
Discussing Doctrines at Baal (pronounced Bale)
Causing People to Fail
Keeping A third in jail
His word is nailed, everything to the tree
Severing all the me
From all I used to be
Formless and void
Totally paranoid
Enjoyed darkness as lord
Keeping me from the sword
Blocked from mercy
Bitter than Ceres
Hungry and thirsty
For good meat, we would eat
And still dine at the table of deciet
How incomplete
From confrontation to retreat
We belong to true enemy's defeat
Destitute a necessity
Causing desperation to get the best of me
Punishment 'till there was nothing left of me
Realizing the inescapable death of me
No options in the valley of decision
The only option supernatural circumsicion
Inwardly
only water can purge the hearts from words
The firey darts
Thrown by the workers of the arts
Iniquity
shaping in
there's no escaping when
Your whole philosiphy is paper thin
In vanity
The wide road is insanity
Can it be all of humanity
Picture that
Scripture that
The origin of man's heart is black
How can we show up for
an invisible war
Preoccupied with a shadow
Making love with a whore
Aching in sores
Babylon the great mystery
Mother of human history
System of social socercery
Our present condition needs serious recongnition
Where's there's no repentance there can be no remission
And that sentence more serious than Vietnam,
the atom bomb and Sudam and Minister Farakhan
What's going on
What's a priority to you
By what authority do we
Majority hasn't a clue
We majored in curses
Search the chapters check the verses
Recapture the land remove the mark off our hands
So we can stand
In agreement with his commands
Everything else is damned
Let them with ears understand
Everything else is damned
Let them with ears understand Its Freedom
Said, its Freedom Time now
Its Freedom
Said its Freedom Time now
Its Freedom
I'm a be who I am
Its freedom time
Said, its freedom time
Everybody knows that they lied
Everybody knows they perpertrated inside
Everybody knows that thier guilt is
Resting on their conscious eating thier insides
Get free
Be who you're supposed to be
Freedom
Said its freedom time now
Freedom

Not even if my boss should call
The world it seems so very small
'Cause nothing even matters at all Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters at all See I don't need no alcohol
Your love makes me feel ten feet tall
Without it I'd go through withdrawal
'Cause nothing even matters at all Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters at all These buildings could drift out to sea
Some natural catastrophe
Still there's no place I'd rather be
'Cause nothing even matters to me Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters to me
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters to me You're part of my identity
I sometimes have the tendency
To look at you religiously
'Cause nothing even matters to me Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters to me
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters to me Now you won't find me at no store
I have no time for manicures
With you it's never either or
'Cause nothing even matters no more Nothing it don't matter
Nothing even matters no more
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters no more Now my team could score
And make it to the Final Four
Just repossess my 4x4
'Cause nothing even matters no more Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters no more
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters no more Adam lives in theory
Trying to turn stone into bread
Masquerading like he got it figured out
Cut off from the sunshine, only smart in his own head
Leaving his descendants to hope and doubt
Left to his devices, those worthless sacrifices
Praying to the alter of himself
Making pilgrimages, thinking he's religious
Like he's got all the light, and no one else He takes the unsuspected
Cuz he knows they're not connected
And he shows them how to be just as he is
Virtually real, and commercially appealed
To the lust of all the people where he lives Eve was so naive, blinded by the pride and greed
Wanting to be intellectual
Drifting from the way she got turned down one day
And now she thinks that she's bisexual Caught up in emotion
Burning up in her devotion
To the king of exploitaion in the field
She handed him her virtue
Cuz he told her "I won't hurt you"
So she lay with him to see how good it feels Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now
Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now Now after the sensation, and the empty fornication
She brought affection home into her bed, quickly multiplying
Now the 3 of them are dieing by the poison she perceived to be good bread
Now Eve and her husband are perverted in their judgment
Cuz everything appears to be the same
They entertain suggestion,
Next time just use protection Desiring to cover up their shame
But much to their demise, poor decision closed their eyes
To the very antidote to their dilemma
Burning in their lust,
Both of them adulterous
Destroying the original agenda
Praying to the sky, in order to maintain a lie
They exhausted every possible conclusion,
They can't even entertain the solution,
In a brain filled with vain information and pollution Hiding from the truth,
He provided an excuse to explain away his desperate situation
When confronted, blamed his wife
Giving birth to carnal life
Refusing to acknowledge what he done Now if we can't agree with who created us to be
Who says we're guilty everyone before his eyes
Making no exceptions, since the day of our conception
Predisposed to hating truth, and loving lies Then can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now
Then can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now Stop walking in pride, let the thief be crucified
Un-learn everything you know, and let him teach you
Line upon line, every step upon pre-step, say goodbye,
To this decaying social system
He wants to know, how far we're willing to go
If we love him like we say we do,
He will try us Just don't regress,
Or slip into hopelessness
Once he's satisfied his love,
He won't deny us, And then he'll tell us,
What, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now And then he'll tell us,
What, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now spoken: Like Fungus Among Us
I treat this like my thesis.
Well-written topic
Broken down into pieces.
I introduce then produce
Words so profuse.
It's abuse how I juice up this beat
Like I'm deuce.
Two people both equal.
Like I'm Gemini
Rather simeon.
If I Jimmy on this lock I could pop it.
You can't stop it.
Drop it.
Your whole crew's microscopic
Like particles while I make international articles.
And on the cover
Don't discuss the baby mother business.
I been in this third LP you can't tell me, I witness.
First handed, I'm candid.
You can't stand it.
Respect demanded
And get flown around the planet.
Rock Hard Like granite or steel.
People feel like Lauryn Hill from New-Ark Israel.
And this is real.
So I keep makin' the street's ballads
While lookin' for dressin' to go with your tossed salad.
You can get the money.
You can get the power.
But keep your eyes on the final hour.
You can get the money.
You can get the power.
But keep your eyes on the final hour.
I'm about to change the focus
From the richest to the brokest.
I wrote the opus
To reverse the hypnosis.
Whoever's closest
To the line's gonna win it.
You gonna fall tryin' to ball
While my team win the pennant.
I'm about to be in it.
For a minute.
Then run for the senate.
Make a slum lord be tenant.
Give his money to kids to spend it.
And then amend it.
Every law that ever prevented.
Our survival since our arrival
Documented in the Bible.
Like Moses and Aaron.
Things gon' change, that's apparent.
And all the transparent gonna
Be seen through.
Let God redeem you.
Keep your deen true.
You can get the green, too.
Watch out what you cling to.
Observe how a queen do.
And I remain calm readin the 73 Psalm.
'Cause wit all this on I got the word in palm.
You can get the money.
You can get the power.
But keep your eyes on the final hour.
You can get the money.
You can get the power.
But keep your eyes on the final hour.
Now I be breakin' bread sippin'
Manichevitz wine.
Pay no mind party like it's 1999.
But when it comes down to ground beef like Palestine.
Say your rhymes, lets see if that get you out your bend.
Now I'm gonna get the mozarella like Rockefeller.
Still be in the church of Lalibela.
Singing hymns a cappella.
Whether posed in Maribella in Couture
Or collectin' residuals from off The Score.
I'm makin' sure
I'm with the 144.
I've been here before this ain't a battle this is war.
Word to Boonie
I makes a lot like Sunni.
Get diplomatic immunity in evety ghetto community.
Had opportunity went from
Hoodshock to Hood-chic
But it ain't what you cop
It's about what you keep.
And even if there are leaks
You can't capsize this ship.
'Cause I baptize my lips every time I take a sip.
You can get the money.
You can get the power.
But keep your eyes on the final hour.
You can get the money.
You can get the power.
But keep your eyes on the final hour.
You can get the money.
You can get the power.
But keep your eyes on the final hour.
You can get the money.
You can get the power.
But keep your eyes on the final hour.
You can get the money.
You can get the money.
Get the money.
Get, get the money.
Tyou can get the money. You can get the money.
You can get the money.
The final hour.
But keep your eyes,
keep your eyes
keep your eyes
on the final hour.
Now you can get the money
and you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the final hour.
Final hour
Final hour
Final hour. Oh Jerusalem yeah, oh Jerusalem, oh Jerusalem, oh Jerusalem... Realizing that there's no place else to go
And there's nobody I know who can help me
Text book solutions are so improbable
Cuz everybody you know is just as empty
Naked as the day that I was born, I tried to hide
...behind education and philosophy
But it's a hopeless explanation to describe the situation
I can't see because the world's on top of me
Oh wretched man that I am, who will deliver me
From the body of this death
Freeing me from dust, and the superficial trust
Of an enemy that seeks to take my breath
Failing to connect, cuz I'm morally defect
By reason of the god inside my head
Causing me to see, only what pertains to me
Believing I'm alive when I'm still dead
Limited to earth, unable to find out my worth
Cuz I... can't see past my own vanity
If I'm not included, then I just have to remove it
From my mind because it has to be in sanity
Oh wretched man that I am, who will deliver me
From the body of this death
Can I even factor, that I've only been an actor
In this staged interpretation of this day
Focused on the shadow, with my back turned to the light
Too intelligent to see it's me in the way
What a paradox, having God trapped in a box
All this time professing to be spiritual
Naturally pretending, that I'm actually defending
God thru my facade only material Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long, shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee
Oh Jerusalem, keeping thee from perfection Submit to truth, leave the deception of thy youth
So we could walk in the council of authority
Forget the proof, a generations so aloof
Only followin' the steps of the majority
Trust in the Lord, with all thine heart
And lean not to thine own understanding in all thy ways
Acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths
Be not wise in thine on eyes,
Or you can't follow Him
We judge and condemn, just as ignorant as them
Who religion tells us that we should ignore
Perpetrating we're in covenant with Him
Exposed by the very things that we adore
We grin and shake hands, then lay ambush for the man
Who has a different point of view then us
Infuriated cuz he doesn't understand
Bringing up those things we don't want to discuss
Why still do evil, when we don't know how to do good
Walking on in darkness running from the light, ey
Led to believe, because we live in neighborhoods
Telling us what's going on will be alright
Oh so repressed, so convinced that I was blessed
When I played with my game of monopoly
Oh to suggest, that my life is still a mess
Will reveal the pride I'm hiding is what's stopping me Oh Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long, shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee
Oh Jerusalem providing you no protection. Abide in Me and I in you, as the branch cannot bare
...fruit of itself except in the vine
I am the Vine, ye are the branches,
He that live in Me and I in him,
The same bring forth much fruit
For without me, you can do nothing
Oh Jerusalem, you're traditions have deceived you
I've chosen you, you haven't chosen Me
Do whatsoever, you asking My Name He may give to you
But in vain they call My Name
teaching doctrines just the same
Justified among themselves
But God know knoweth the heart,
what man esteemed as smart
Is an abomination to Emmanuel
Just repent, turn from selfish motivation
So iniquity will not cause your demise
Make you a new heart and a new spirit
...for why would you die
Oh Jerusalem, please tell me why I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth(sp?)
Says the Lord God where forth turn yourselves and live
It's not the talkers, but the walkers and His word
Are the only ones the Father will forgive Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou may be saved from thy deception
How long, shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee
Oh Jerusalem, providing you no protection Oh Jerusalem... (fade) We're living in a joke time, metaphorical coke time

Fling, skind, grin while dem plotting fah you
True, Ah Who? Forgive them father for they know not what they do
Forgive them father for they know not what they do Beware the false motives of others
Be careful of those who pretend to be brothers
And you never suppose it's those who are closest to you, to you
They say all the right things to gain their position
Then use your kindness as their ammunition
To shoot you down in the name of ambition, they do Forgive them father for they know not what they do
Forgive them father for they know not what they do Why every Indian wanna be the chief?
Feed a man 'til he's full and he still want beef
Give me grief, try to tief off my piece
Why for you to increase, I must decrease?
If I treat you kindly does it meant that I'm weak?
You hear my speak an think I won't take it do the streets
I know enough cats that don't turn the other cheek
But I try to keep it civilized like Menelik
And other African czars ovserving stars with war scars
Get yours in this capitalistic system
So many caught or got bought you can't list them
How you gonna idolize the missing?
To survive is to stay alive in the face of opposition
Even when they comin' gunnin'
I stand position
L's known the mission since conception
Let's free the people from deception
If you looking for the answers
Then you gotta ask the questions
And when I let go, my voice echoes through hate ghetto
Sick of men trying to pull strings like Gepetto
Why black people always be the ones to settle
March through these streets like Soweto
Like Cain and Abel, Caesar and Brutus, Jesus and Judas
Backstabbers do this Forgive them father for they know not what they do
Forgive them father for they know not what they do It took me a little while to discover
Wolves in sheep coats who pretend to be lovers
Men who lack conscience will even lie to themselves, to themselves
A friend once said, and I found to be true
That everyday people, they lie to God too
So what makes you think, that they won't lie to you Forgive them father for they know not what they do
Forgive them, forgive them
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
Forgive them, forgive them Gwan like dem love while dem rip yuh to shreds
Trample pon yuh heart and lef yuh fi dead
Dem a yuh fren who yuh depen pon from way back when
But if yuh gi dem yuh back den yuh mus meef yuh end
Dem noh know wey dem do
Dem no know, dem no know, dem no know
Dem no konw, dem no know wey dem do The Conquering Lion The conquering lion shall break every chain

The conquering lion he's gonna break all of those chains if you just let him
Give Give him the victory again and again and again and again...
Oh, give him the victory Nothing can be done against the truth
No matter how we remain in denial (yeah)
Wasting time
Replacing time
With each empty excuse
But that'll only work a little while
Coping with despair
Knowin' you're not there
Ashamed to just admit
I've been a fool
So I blame it on the son
Run away from everyone
Hoping to escape this ridicule
Trapped in misery
Wrapped so miserably
In this deception that I'm wearin' it like a skin Dying to maintain
Oh I keep trying to explain
A heart that never loved me to begin
Oh I'm such a mess
I have no choice but to confess
That I've been desperately trying to belong
Lying to myself
And everybody else
Refusing to admit my right was wrong And then he came

That it is seen How beautiful is fruit still in denial of its roots?
My guilty heart behaves so foolishly
This treason from within
That reasons with my sin
Won't be happy til' it sees the death of me
Selfishly addicted
To a life that I depicted
Conflicted cuz it's not reality
Oh what's left of me
I beg you desperately
Cause me to agree to what I know is best for me
Please save me from myself
I need you to save me from myself
Please save me from myself so I can heal
The choices that I make
Oh have been nothing but mistakes
What a wasted use of space
Should I die before I wake?
In all of my religion
I've fortified this prison
Obligated to obey
The demands of bad decision
Please save me from myself
I need you to save me from myself
Please save me from myself so I can heal And then he came

Everything you drop is so tired
Music is supposed to inspire
How come we ain't getting no higher?
Now tell me your philosophy
On exactly what an artist should be
Should they be someone with prosperity
And no concept of reality?
Now, who you know without any flaws
That lives above the spiritual laws
And does anything they feel just because
There's always someone there who'll applaud Come on baby, light my fire
Everything you drop is so tired
Music is supposed to inspire
So, how come we ain't getting no higher?
I know you think that you've got it all
And by making other people feel small
Makes you think you're unable to fall
But when you do, who you gonna call?
See, what you give is just what you get
I know it hasn't hit you yet
Now I don't mean to get you upset
But every 'cause has an effect Come on baby, light my fire
Everything you drop is so tired
Music is supposed to inspire
So, how come we're not getting no higher?
I cross sands in distand lands, made plans with the sheiks
Why you beef with freaks as my album sales peak?
All I wanted was to sell like 500
And be a ghetto superstar since my first album 'Blunted'
I used to work at Foot Locker, they fired me and fronted
Or I quitted, now I spit it - however do you want it?
Now you get it!
Writing rhymes my range with the frames sightly tinted
Then send it to your block and have my full name cemeented
And if your rhymes sound like mine, I'm taking a percentage
Unprecedented and still respected when it vintage
I'm serious, I'm taking over areas in Aquarius
Running red lights with my 10, 000 chariotes
Just as Christ was a superstar, you stupid star
They'll hail you then they'll nail you, no matter who you are
They'll make you now then take you down
And make you face it, if you slit the bag open
And put your pinky in it, then taste it Come on baby, light my fire
Everything you drop is so tired
Music is supposed to inspire
So, how come we ain't getting no higher (Repeat to end) I gotta find peace of mind, "I know you are never goin' to"
I gotta find peace of mind
See, this is what that voice in your head says
When you try to get peace of mind
I gotta find peace of mind, I gotta find peace of mind He says it's impossible
But I know it's possible
He says it's impossible
But I know it's possible He says there's no me without him, please help me forget about him
He takes all my energy, trapped in my memory
Constantly holdin' me, constantly holdin' me
I need to tell you all, all the pain he's caused
I need to tell you I'm, I'm undone because He says it's impossible
But I know it's possible
He says it's impossible without him
But I know it's possible To finally be in love and know the real meaning of
A lasting relationship, not based on ownership
I trust every part of you 'cause all that I
All that you say you do, you love me despite myself Sometimes I, I fight myself
I just can't believe that you
Would have anything to do
With someone so insecure
Someone so immature Oh, you inspire me to be the higher me
You make my desire pure, you make my desire pure
Just tell me what to say, I can't find the words to say
Please don't be mad with me, I have no identity All that I've known is gone, all I was buildin' on
I wanna walk with you, how do I talk to you?
Touch my mouth with your hands, touch my mouth with your hands
Oh, I wanna understand the meaning of your embrace
I know now I have to face the temptations of my past Please don't let me disgrace, will my devotion last?
Now that I know the truth, now that it's no excuse
Keeping me from your love, what was I thinkin' of
Holdin' me from ya love, what was I thinkin' of You are my peace of mind
That old me is left behind
You are my peace of mind
That old me is left behind there He says it's impossible
But I know it's possible

It's the mystery of Inequity...
Said it's the misery of Inequity...
Said it's the history of Inequity...
When it all...
All falls down...
Telling you all...
It all falls down Children...
Eat your bread
Little children...
Eat your bread
Cuz it all...
All falls down...
Telling you all...
It all falls down [First and only verse]
Yo!
Ya'll can't handle the truth in a courtroom of lies
Perjures the jurors
Witness despised
Crooked lawyers
False Indictments publicized
Its entertainment... the arraignments
The subpoenas
High profile gladiators in bloodthirsty arenas
Enter the Dragon
Black-robe crooked-balance
Souls bought and sold and paroled for thirty talents
Court reporter catch the circus on the paper
File it in the system not acknowledged by the Maker
Swearing by the bible blatantly blasphemous
Publicly perpetrating that "In God We Trust"
Cross-examined by a master manipulator
The faster intimidator
Receiving the judge's favor
Deceiving sabers doing injury to they neighbors
For status, gratis, apparatus and legal waivers
See the bailiff
Representing security
Holding the word of God soliciting perjury
The prosecution
Political prostitution
The more money you pay. the further away solution
Legal actors
Babylon's benefactors
Masquerading as the agency for the clients
Hypocritical giants
Morally non-compliant
Orally armed to do bodily harm
Polluted, recruited and suited judicial charm
And the defense isn't making any sense
Faking the confidence of escaping the consequence
That a defendant is depending on the system
Totally void of judgment purposely made to twist em'
Emotional victim blackmailed by the henchmen
Framed by intentions
Inventions whereby they lynch men
Enter the false witness slandering the accused
Planting the seed openly showing he's being used
To discredit, edit, headed for the alleged
Smearing the individual fearing the unsuspected
Expert witness (the paid authority)
Made a priority to deceive the majority
Of disinterested peers
Dodging duty for years
Hating the process
waiting to return to their careers
Do we expect the system made for the elect
To possibly judge correct?
Properly serve and protect?
Materially corrupt
Spiritually amuck
Oblivious to the cause
Prosperously bankrupt
Blind leading the blind
Guilty never defined
Filthy as swine
A generation purin it's own mind
Legal extortion
Blown out of proportion
In vein deceit
The truth is obsolete
Only two positions:
Victimizer or Victim
Both end up in destruction trusting this crooked system
Mafia with diplomas keeping us in a coma trying to own a piece
of the "American Corona"
The Revolving Door
Insanity every floor
Skyscraping, paper chasing
What are we working for?
Empty traditions
Reaching social positions
Teaching ambition to support the family superstition?
When the Son of Perdition is Commander in Chief
The standard is Thief
Brethren can we candidly speak?
Woe to the men
Trusted in the chariots dem'
Leaning on horses
They run to intellectual sources
Counterfeit wisdom creating the illusion of freedom
Confusion consumes them
Every word they speak entombs them outwardly white
But Internally they absent of light
trapped in the night and bonded to the Cain of the night
Under the curse
Evil men waxing more worse
Faxing the first
Angelic being cast to the earth
It's time for rebirth
Burnin up the branch and the root
The empty pursuits of every tree bearing the wrong fruit
Turn and be healed
Let him who stole, no longer steal
Oh it's real
Surrender for Jehovah is real
How long will you sleep
Troubled by the thoughts that YOU keep
The idols YOU heap
Causing the destruction you reap
Judgment has come
Find it and return to the One
Abandon the flesh
Self-interest: Broadway to death
Pride and the Greed
Hide and subdividing the seed
The knowledge of Good and Evil is what caused us to lie
Caused us to die
Let your emotions be crucified
Renounce all your thoughts
Repent and let your mind be re-taught
You'll find what you sought... was based on the deception you bought
A perception of naught
Where the majority remains caught Loving a lie
Not realizing in Adam, all die
Loving a lie
Not realizing in Adam, all die
Loving a lie
Not realizing in Adam, all die
Loving a lie
Not realizing in Adam, [sing songy Chorus Outro]

I just want you around Thought that I had lost you
I could hardly make a sound
When I thought I couldn't hold you
Knew the world had let me down
Should have took the time and told you
You keep my feet on the ground
I hope that you can hear me
Cause I know it's not profound I just want you around,
I just need you around
I just want you around,
I just need you around When I thought I was without you
I got used to being down
Was my fault I used to doubt you
But that ain't me next time around
Please believe me when I tell you
Cause all my words are bound
This is my cross so let me bear it
I was lost but now I am found, found, found I just want you around,
I just need you around
I just want you around,
I just need you around Took this love for granted
Kept my feelings under ground
Should have watered what I planted
Should have known what I had found
I'm not used to being lonely
I don't like the way it sounds
You're the only one I know yeah
Who don't turn my upside down I just want you around,
I just need you around
I just want you around,
I just need you around
(Repeat to end) VERSE1:
I was born into this world
Little bitty baby girl
And when I look at why looking so glad
In a racist world
Now it's a difficult process
The matter is of perception
When I look in the mirror what do I see
Is it my reflection? CHORUS:
Seein' repercussions (talkin bout the things we do)
Ya need to know the repercussions (things can come right back to you)
Look at them repercussions (what goes around comes around)
Heyyy repercussions VERSE2:
See I was born into this
In another space in time
Time has moved on a death has grown closer
Surely has blown my mind (blown my mind)
Aint that a b**ch...the way the world spins around (spins around, spins around, spins around)
Everything, everything, everything that I said and I did
Surely came back around CHORUS:
See repercussions (talkin bout the things we do)
Repercussions (things sure can come back to you)
Yeah repercussions (what goes around comes around)
Yeah repercussions (they will get you down) Repercussions (talkin' bout the things we do)
Yeah Repercussions (things sure can come back to you)
Ya need to know that repercussions (what goes around comes around)
Repercussions (they will get you down) I used to do it for the love a long time ago
And all I ever wanted was love
I used to love without fear a long time ago
And all I ever wanted was love
Then somebody came around and tried to hurt me
Tried to make me feel like I was unworthy
Took a pure love and tried to make it dirty
Truth was they never did deserve me
No! Chorus:
I had to lose myself so I could love you better
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
love you better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself
So I could love you better
Had to lose myself in love
And that's just the way it is... Couldn't tell me I was love when I needed it
When, all I ever wanted was love.
Should a told me just me because!
I'm worth receiving it
But all I ever wanted was love
There's is something awkward about the selflessness it
takes to
Give love and the good that it makes you!
True love can never really forsake you
But it took a little while just for me to see! Chorus:
I had to lose myself so I could love you better
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
love you better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself
So I could love you better
Had to lose myself in love
And that's just the way it is... I had a paralyzing fear of facing failure
And I couldn't love you perfectly with fear in my head
So I peerlessly had to face the danger
So I could come back and love you whole instead
All of your soul I said!
So I could make it better Chorus:
I had to lose myself so I could love you better 
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
love you better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself
So I could love you better
Had to lose myself in love
And that's just the way it is... B-Sec:
And so it goes that I never meant to hurt you
Couldn't stay but I never meant to desert you
Whole lot a things I just had to work thru
Time to heal and restore myself worth too
Confrontation of my fears and anxiety
Cried a whole lot years I suffered quietly
And though it may have taken years I can finally!
Tell you that you were always on my mind! Chorus:
I had to lose myself so I could make it better
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
make it better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself
So I could make it better
Had to lose myself in love
And that was just the way! Bridge: Takes strength to absorb all the abuse I did
Great love to absorb all the misuse I did
Hey baby it's not an excuse I give.
And I'd do it all again because for you I live Takes strength to absorb all the abuse I did
Great love to absorb all the abuse I did
Hey baby it's not an excuse I give.
And I'd do it all again because for you I live Chorus:
I had to lose myself so I could make it better
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
make it better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself
So I could make it better
Had to lose myself in love
And that was just the way!
And that was just the way it is Can I get some of that tea, some of that tea. I know I sound raspy but that's
Hey, I used to go on tour yaw know, and I'd be a prisoner, I used to be a
Prisoner on tour cause I would go on tour and tour you're supposed to enjoy and
Have a good time but I'd be this prisoner in the hotel you know drinking' tea
And ya know tellin' children ya know mommy has to sleep cause I wanted to
Maintain this ya know immaculate sounding voice, but that's not realistic, ya
Know reality is sometimes I stay up late and this is what I sound like when I
Wake up the next day, and ya know its a voice ya know and to me the the more I
Uh focus less on myself the more I realize I can be used to spread a message
Because when I am I used to be so ya know oh my god if I sound ya know harsh
And raspy I can't go out there, that's a lie ya know I just sound like a
Singer with a lot of stuff in her throat
So, I told the people at MTV that they gotta like me better if not then people
Are gonna keep on sayin' who's that boy on stage. Who's that little boy. OK
We're just finishing tune up, OK I was just a little girl, skinny legs, a press and curl

When kids were stealin' quarter bills for fun
'Til the guy in Carter Park
Rode a mongoose 'til it's dark
Watchin' kids show off the stolen ones Every ghetto, every city and suburban place I've been
Make me recall my days in the New Jerusalem You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got

Make me recall my days in the New Jerusalem
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got
Lookin' back, lookin' back, lookin' back, lookin' back
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got
Lookin' back, lookin' back, lookin' back, lookin' back
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got
Looking back, lookin' back, lookin' back, lookin' back
Lookin' back, lookin' back, lookin' back
Lookin' back, lookin' back, lookin' back
Lookin' back, lookin' back, lookin' back
Lookin' back, lookin' back, lookin' back
Lookin' back, lookin' back, lookin' back Black is the color of my true love's hair
His face so soft and wondrous fair
The purest eyes
And the strongest hands
I love the ground on where he stands
I love the ground on where he stands Black is the color of my true love's hair
Of my true love's hair
Of my true love's hair Oh I love my lover
And well he knows
Yes, I love the ground on where he goes
And still I hope
That the time will come
When he and I will be as one
When he and I will be as one So black is the color of my true love's hair
Black is the color of my true love's hair
Black is the color of my true love's hair Yo, remember back on the boogie when cats used to harmonize like
Yo, my men and my women
Don't forget about the deen, Sirat al-Mustaqeem
Yo, it's about a thing
If ya feel real good wave your hands in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere! It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you ain't hear him, then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again Guys you know you'd better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men, come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (Like you got yen!)
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of they three or four kids
And they face a court case when the child support late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky, silent men
The punk, domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
Come again Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out Girls you know you'd better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing Guys you know you'd better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing Girls you know you'd better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing Its like.
if you.
tired of that.
you give yourself up...
Listen, nobody can blackmail you with anything.
I'll never forget...
you know when I first...
started to really understand what this was all about.
I just went to my parents and I just started confessing about the stuff I did like in the second grade...
seriously...
but we don't know how all that stuff from the time we're kids man...
all that repression...
all that stuff just holding you.
You know all that.
Talking about boys feeling my booty in the second grade.
I mean I'm telling you, and I'm ashamed of that.
You know?
Like no, like.
what other girl in this audience played run catch and kiss or those silly games?
You know?
But just from a child, you know, growing up with all of that guilt.
You know?
And we think that that's God.
We think that's God...
Telling us feel guilty!
God is saying get free.
Confess man.
Understand that.
look.
everybody's going through that same stuff.
same issues its just a bunch of repression.
And I'm saying man, life is too precious.
its too valuable.
for us to just sit here in this boxes all repressed.
You know?.
Afraid to admit what we're really going through.
You know?
I'm saying, I'm tired of that.
I'll tell people, listen its so funny it's like.
you know, when I tried to...
I'll never forget.
when I was pregnant with my first son and I was trying to keep it a secret it was all of over the place.
You know?
And when I said hey, I'm having another baby.
I didn't hear about it at all.
And I said man, y'all just want to deal in stuff that people don't want out.
So I just gave myself out.
Yeah, I'm having another child.
What else would you want to know?
Yeah I'm crazy and deranged Okay, yeah, alright I find it hard to say that everything is alright
Don't look at me that way like everything is alright
'Cuz my own eyes can see through all your false pretenses
But what you fail to see is all the consequences You think our lives are cheap and easy to be wasted
As history repeats so foul you can taste it
And while the people sleep too comfortable to face it
His life so incomplete and nothing can replace it And while the people sleep too comfortable to face it
Your life's so incomplete and nothing can replace it
Fret not thyself I say against these laws of man
'Cuz like the Bible says, his blood is on their hands And what I gotta say and what I gotta say is rebel
While today is still today, choose well
And what I gotta say is rebel, it can't go down this way
Choose well, choose well, choose well
Choose well, choose well, choose well And while the people sleep too comfortable to face it
Your lives are so incomplete
And nothing and no one can replace it
No no no no no no, no no no no no no And what I gotta say and what I gotta say
And what I gotta say and what I gotta say
And what I gotta say and what I gotta say
And what I gotta say and what I gotta say
Is rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel
Rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel Repent, the day is far too spent, rebel, rebel
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up and rebel We must destroy in order to rebuild
Wake up, you might as well
Oh, are you, oh, are you satisfied?
Oh, are you satisfied?
Rebel ohh, rebel Why don't you rebel? Why don't you rebel?
Why don't you rebel?
I'm fading myself down now If they only owned love, shown love, grown love, like this before
If they only knew love, true love, to love, like this before
If they only gave love, saved love, brave love, like this before
If they only called love, love love, called love, like this before If they? d only showed love, they owed love, owed love, like this before

If they ever showed love, they owed love, they owed love, like this before Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
La la la la la, la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la If they only claimed love, claimed love, claimed love
They maintained love instead they drained love, stained love
They didn? t control love, my soul loves a whole love, like this before
Received the same love
If they didn? t regret love, forget love, say they never met love
If they will love, don? t kill love, just be still love If they only claimed love, claimed love, claimed love
They maintained love instead they drained love, stained love

Received the same love
If they didn? t regret love, forget love, say they never met love
If they will love, don? t kill love, just be still love Strummin' my pain with his fingers
Singin' my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
telling my whole life with his words
killing me softly with his song
I heard he sang a good song
I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him
And listen for a while
And there he was this young boy
A stranger to my eyes
Strummin' my pain with his fingers
Singin' my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
telling my whole life with his words
killing me softly with his song
I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters
And read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on
Strummin' my pain with his fingers
(One time, one time)
Singin' my life with his words
(Two times, two times)
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
telling my whole life with his words
killing me softly with his song
I said whoa oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, la, la, la, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohla, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Strummin' my pain with his fingers
(Yes he was)
Singin' my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
telling my whole life with his words
killing me softly with his song... Yo... (Can I see you?)
Lauryn Hill on the track... (In the morning)
New art got my back...
DJ Skribble just relax, haha!
I'm a get you the joint! haha! (Can I see you?)
Yeah... morning (In the morning!)
Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Uh Huh! As I span the cosmos
Mahogany travel at the speed of sound
Span the mainstream but still esteemed underground
My parameters, and wrap up contaminants
Travel twice Earth's diameter, intimidating amateurs
At the Apollo, I played the shepherd sheep followed
Chicks try to model after me like I'm Tyra Banks
Wanna thank me because my statements are prodigious
Styles so prestigious, make a sinner act religious
Street academics, seen alot of girls mimic
But when it's all over you can tell who's the gimmick
L slang-bangs like a dub plate
Jericho Sound System, mash up your club dates
Sweeter than a cherry on a fruit cocktail
Whenever, Wherever, Whatever
Like Maxwell
My pentium, makes more chips than Intel
I didn't mean to turn you on like Sherell
Kids move they body like they're tripping off of acid
Not even fantasy can surpass it
Once you blast it one starts to feel kinky
I think thee, goes by the name of Young Slinky
And just when you thought it was safe to relax
L-Boogie spits with perfect syntax!
Then, DJ Skribble make you dribble on the wax
DJ Skribble make you dribble on the wax! Can I hear you in the morning (Can I see you?)
like I hear you late at night?
Chance to hear you (In the morning)
Amp the party
DJ Skribble keep it tight
(Can I see you?)
Just a short time in the morning
Like I hear you late at night (In the morning)
Chance to hear you
Amp the party
DJ Skribble keep it tight! Can I hear you in the morning (Can I see you?)
Like I hear you late at night (In the morning!)
Chance to hear you
Amp the party
DJ Skribble, KEEP IT TIGHT!
Forte' 3x
Keep it tight! Of the world
Spun by evil men with lies
Only programmed to agree
With what we see before our eyes
Running after status quo
On a television show
Just a picture perfect life
Its the only life we know
And this uncomfortable reality
Got me chasing, chasing fallacy
And the pace the pace is killing me
But I so willingly practiced it
Just like its my friend
When the whole world is a hustle
Exactly where did we arrive
In this manufactured life
to Sell my soul just to survive (yes)
In the game of numbers
I must thank the Gods of Industry
oh for the opportunity
or I display such loyalty
oh for the way that they exploit me (yes)
Oh to consider life outside of this
Just like a splinter in
My mind persists
But the ministry of fear exists
Only to keep me from knowing the truth
Stealing my youth (oooh)
When the whole world is a hustle
Escape familiarity
Means that I must face the fear in me
And do something with this greed in me
In order to address this need in me
Oh but I must confess
The pride I keep
Protecting as if its my friend
Oh, when will it end?
When the whole world is a hustle
To consider life
Outside of this
Just like a splinter in
My mind persists.
But the ministry of fear exists
Only to keep me from knowing the truth.
And its my excuse
When the whole world is a hustle
When it is, when it is.
(Instrumental)
Oh to escape this mere analogy
Means I must face the fear in me
And do something with this greed in me
In order to address this need in me
Oh but I must confess
The pride I keep
Protecting as if its my friend
Until the bitter end
When the whole of the world is a hustle
Everybodys got it going on (yeah right, yeah right)
Everybodys so damn strong (yeah right, yeah right)
When the whole of the world is a hustle
A hustle (x5)
I must exercise my faith
When the whole world is a hustle I'll tell you every single-We all have gifts, you know, and uh, like special gifts. And there's this voice inside of us that says "don't do that," you know, "Why you gonna get up there with that guitar? You're gonna like like a, a hip hop folk singer. What are you, you know, what are you?..." (Laughter) And I really went through, I mean, I'm serious, I mean I can laugh about it now, but it took a long time for me to understand that, you know, what I am is what I am and I can't be afraid to, you know, to expose that to the public. You know, always-get in trouble trying to make it, tryin' to dress it up, you know what I'm sayin'? Just tired of that, you know. Just tired of that. Tired of frontin', Tired of that... And until I find a group of people that are as passionate about it as I am, I'll just roll alone until such time, you know. It's all good, God is faithful. Y'all still get to hear it, so, you know? 'Cause see that enemy he would tell me, you know "You don't have the 20 piece band, you can't do nothin'." I said, "Yeah, sure... Keep talkin'." 'Cause somebody's gonna, they gonna see me and they gonna know "Oh I, there's somethin' that God's been tellin me to do. I can do it, too. I can do what I'm supposed to be doin', I don't need an entourage. What do I need a crew for?" That doesn't validate you. Okay, let's see. Mmmm... OK. Oh no! not you! What are you doing here?
Oh boy it's gonna be hard now... Can we put him in the back?
Robin, Robin, Robin... I used to get dressed for you all, I don't do that no more, I'm sorry... it's a new day, I don't have the energy... Ya'll like my jokes? OK so, ah... these are brand new songs, that a very few people have heard hmm
very much about... you know, whatever... I been going trough and what I been
learning lot of her, wonderful life lessons, you know, that are easy to combine
but you're very blessed after you realize why you had to go trough what you had
to go trough... is it very important that you really listen to the words, you
know, and if you have a hard time to hear what I'm saying please raise your hand
you know, object... whatever... you guys ready in there? (All set) OK ...and I... you know, It's really interesting because I used to... I used to be a performer, and I really don't consider myself a performer so much anymore, I'm really just... you know I'm sharing... you know... more or less the music that I've been giving, but if I stop, if I start, if I... you know... feel like saying baby, baby, baby for... eighten bars... whatever... you know...
I just I do that... So You guys are cool? [Yeah!] Ok I'm talking to people in my head too, It's alright though. This is worth my? ape lope?. I'm just gonna finish sucking on my Lazenger. Ok so this particular song is called Mr. Intentional will see, we tune that nowthis is
one? ape lope? Okay, yeah, alright I find it hard to say that everything is alright
Don't look at me that way like everything is alright
'Cuz my own eyes can see through all your false pretenses

Clean cut and dapper, seems he's straight and narrow
Tinglin' the bone marrow, team the almighty apparel
But I ain't that aggressive, instead I act suggestive
Bat my eye lashes right through the sunglasses
Sound perfectly with the classic under my dark glasses
I mouthin' all the words to Blue Magic (You must have put a spell on my
mind)
With all due respect till you 'pproached it
Hand off a the roach clip as I respectfully decline to smoke it

For wild is the wind
You touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
And you kiss me
And with your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me
All things to me
Don't you know you're life itself
Like a leaf clings to a tree
Oh my darling, cling to me
For we're creatures of the wind
And wild is the wind
So wild is the wind

When I thought I couldn't hold you
Knew the world had let me down
Should have took the time and told you
You keep my feet on the ground
I hope that you can hear me
Cause I know it's not profound I just want you around,
I just need you around
I just want you around,
I just need you around When I thought I was without you
I got used to being down
Was my fault I used to doubt you
But that ain't me next time around
Please believe me when I tell you
Cause all my words are bound
This is my cross so let me bear it
I was lost but now I am found, found, found I just want you around,
I just need you around
I just want you around,
I just need you around Took this love for granted
Kept my feelings under ground
Should have watered what I planted
Should have known what I had found
I'm not used to being lonely
I don't like the way it sounds
You're the only one I know yeah
Who don't turn my upside down I just want you around,

one? ape lope? Moving down the streams of my lifetime
Pulls the fascination in my sleeve
Cooling off the fire on my longing
Boiling off my cold within his heat Melting down the walls of inhibition
Evaporating all of my fears
Baptizing me into complete submission
Dissolving my condition with his tears He's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years
He's just like the water, the water
I ain't felt this way in years Coursing through my senses, he's prevailing
Floating through the space of my design
Drowning me to find my inside sailing
Drinking in the mainstream of his mind Filling up the cup of my emotions
Spilling over into all I do
If I only I could get lost in his ocean
Surviving on the thought of loving you He's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years, in years
He's just like the water, the water
I ain't felt this way in years Bathing in the fountain of his essence
He causes my expression to remain
Humbled on a mountain by his presence
Washing my intentions with his name Sealing off the floodgates of his passions
Saving all his liquid for his own
Moisturizing me to satisfaction
In my imagination, no, no He's pouring out his soul to me for hours and hours
Drawing out my nature with his hands
Yearning, I'm so thirsty for his power
Burning to be worthy of his land He's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years
He's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years Cleaning me, he's purging me
And moving me around
He's bathing me and he's claiming me
And moving me around, around
And around and around and around Watching me, claiming me
Moving me around
He's purging me, he's been cleaning me
And moving me around and around
And around, around, around Moving me around I'll tell you every single, we all have gifts you know, and like special gifts
And there's this voice inside of us that says
"Don't do that", you know, "Why you gonna get up there with that guitar?
You're gonna like like a, a hip hop folk singer
What are you, you know, what are you" And I really went through, I mean, I'm serious
I mean I can laugh about it now
But it took a long time for me to understand that
You know, what I am is what I am
And I can't be afraid to, you know to expose that to the public You know, always get in trouble trying to make it
Tryin' to dress it up, you know what I'm sayin'?
Just tired of that, you know, just tired of that
Tired of frontin', tired of that And until I find a group of people
That are as passionate about it as I am
I'll just roll alone until such time, you know
It's all good, God is faithful, y'all still get to hear it, so, you know? 'Cause see that enemy he would tell me, you know
"You don't have the 20 piece band, you can't do nothin'"
I said, "Yeah, sure, keep talkin"
'Cause somebody's gonna, they gonna see me and they gonna know "Oh I, there's somethin' that God's been tellin me to do
I can do it, too I can do what I'm supposed to be doin'
I don't need an entourage what do I need a crew for?"

At long last love has arrived

Founded on 2/3 a person
Rapings and beatings,
suffering worsens
Black human packages tied up in strings
Black Rage comes from all these types of things Black Rage founded on blatant denial
Scream economics, subsistent survival
Deafening silence, social control
Black Rage is founded on wounds in the soul When the dogs bite
When the bees sing
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember all these kind of things And then I don't fear so bad... Black rage is founded who fed us self hatred
Lies and abuse while we waited and waited
Spiritual treason
This grid and it's cages
Black rage was founded on these kinds of things Black rage is founded on draining and draining
Threatening your freedom
To stop your complaining
Poisoning your water
While they say it's raining
Then call you mad
For complaining, complaining
Old time bureaucracy
Drugging the youth
Black rage is founded on blocking the truth
Murder and crime
Compromise and distortion
Sacrifice, sacrifice
Who makes this fortune?
Greed, falsely called progress
Such human contortion
Black rage is founded on these kinds of things So when the dog bites
And the bee stings
And I'm feeling sad
I simply remember all these kinds of things
And then I don't fear so bad Free enterprise
Is it myth or illusion
Forcing you back into purposed confusion
Black human trafficking
Or blood transfusion
Black rage is founded on these kinds of things
Victims of violence
Both psyche and body
Life out of context is living ungodly
Politics, politics
Greed falsely called wealth
Black rage is founded on denying of self So when the dog bites
And the beatings
And I'm feeling so sad
I simply remember all these kinds of things
And then I don't feel so bad Can I get some of that tea, some of that tea. I know I sound rhaspy but thats
hey, I used to go on tour ya know, and I'd be a prisoner, I used to be a
prisoner on tour cause I would go on tour and tour your'e supposed to enjoy and
have a good time but I'd be this prisoner in the hotel you know drinkin' tea
and ya know tellin' children ya know mommy has to sleep cause I wanted to
maintain this ya know emmaculate sounding voice, but that's not realistic, ya
know reality is sometimes I stay up late and this is what I sound like when I
wake up the next day, and ya know its a voice ya know and to me the the more I
uh focus less on myself the more I realize I can be used to spread a message,
because when I am I used to be so ya know oh my god if I sound ya know harsh
and rhaspy I can't go out there, that's a lie ya know I just sound like a
singer with a lot of stuff in her throat. So, I told the people at MTV that they gotta like me better if not then people
are gonna keep on sayin' who's that boy on stage. Who's that little boy. OK,

She can't stand me but I miss her face
I feel like drownin' but the tides too low
And now I'm waiting for the undertow So I stand tall
It gets a little better
I see the water we can break down together
Stand strong it gets a little better now
(we can break it down, yes we can make it)
Stand tall
It gets a little better
I see the water we can break down together
Stand strong it gets a little better now
(we can break it down, yes we can break it)
(we can break it down, yes we can break it) Well I can only take so much
The pressure may come to pressure us
They came to watch us fall
Oh yes, they came to watch us fall
But we will rise up against them all So I stand tall
It gets a little better
I see the water we can break down together
Stand strong it gets a little better now
(we can break it down, yes we can make it)
Stand tall
It gets a little better
I see the water we can break down together
Stand strong it gets a little better now
(we can break it down, yes we can break it)
(we can break it down, yes we can break it) The part of me that fights you like
Gonna sing my song gonna sing it proud
No ones gonna bring me down
Gonna stand up strong gonna hold my ground
Tell me what are we fighting for
Just to do what we done before
Tell me what are we fighting for (fighting for)
(x2) Stand tall
It gets a little better
I see the water we can break down together
Stand strong it gets a little better now
(we can break it down, yes we can break it)
Stand tall
It gets a little better
I see the water we can break down together
Stand strong it gets a little better now
(we can break it down, yes we can break it)
(we can break it down, yes we can break it)
(x2) What is freedom but a fleeting notion,
is this reality or just emotion,
I would rather be a giver then,
be apart of hurting you again, I want to be conformed to love, show me what to do again,
show me to win your love,
I want to be conformed to love,
so I can perform love, My impatience is the part of me,
that I realize you hate you say,
it complicates the very art of you,
show me what ought to do, I want to be comformed to love,
so I can perform love, My Beloved is the greatest Love, YES!!,
I think of him all the time,
My beloved is the greatest love,
please make up my mind, I want to be conformed to love,
so I can make more love,
I want to be pure pure love,
so I can restore love,
so I can make more love,
so I can be sure love,
Help me be secure love,
so I can make more love,
so I can restore love *Talking* That is the objective, to be conformed to love, to actually be love incarnate,
because that is what I was before, but ya'll got that I think, to be love incarnate, and to not listen to people who might say there's something wrong with being love, you know. I'll give you an example: You talked about professionalism,
but what does professionalism have to do with a real exchange,
you are as professional as you have to be right now,
you are as professional as you need to be,
your sincerity has offended me in any way,
it hasn't confused or complicated things,
if anything it's broken down and made the environment more comfortable for everyone else, What did it do, what was the cost of your lack of professionalsim, your so called lack of professionalism, because I don't call it that. I believe a world can exist on honesty, I just do, you know. I'm a believer

Why do you telephone? And why, why send me silly notes?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry, oh... Why do you come here
When you know it makes things hard for me?
When you know, oh Why do you come?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary "oh, it was just to see, just to see"
(all the things you knew i'd written about you...)
And oh so many illustrations Oh, but
I'm so very sickened
Oh, i am so sickened now
Still, it was a good lay, good lay

Oh You have never been in love
Until you've seen the stars
Reflect in the reservoirs And you have never been in love
Until you've seen the dawn rise
Behind the Home for the Blind We are the pretty petty thieves
And you're standing on our streets
Where Hector was the
First of the gang with a gun in his hand
And the first to do time
The first of the gang to die, oh my Hector was the first of the gang
With a gun in his hand
And the first to do time
The first of the gang to die, oh my You have never been in love
Until you've seen the sunlight thrown
Over smashed human bones We are the pretty petty thieves
And you're standing on our streets
Where Hector was the first of the gang
With a gun in his hand
And the first to do time
The first of the gang to die
Such a silly boy Hector was the first of the gang
With a gun in his hand
And a bullet in his gullet
And the first lost lad
To go under the sod And he stole from the rich and the poor
And the not very rich and the very poor
And he stole all hearts away
He stole all hearts away
He stole all hearts away
Away...
He stole all hearts away
Away... Take me out tonight
Where theres music and theres people

Because its not my home, its their
Home, and Im welcome no more And if a double-decker bus

To die by your side

And if a ten-ton truck
Kills the both of us
To die by your side
Well, the pleasure - the privilege is mine Take me out tonight
Take me anywhere, I dont care
I dont care, I dont care
And in the darkened underpass
I thought oh god, my chance has come at last

Back to the bench where your clothes were stolen
This is the coastal town
That they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon!
Come, Armageddon! Come! Everyday is like Sunday
Everyday is silent and grey Hide on the promenade
Etch a postcard:
"How I Dearly Wish I Was Not Here"
In the seaside town
that they forgot to bomb
Come, Come, Come - nuclear bomb Everyday is like Sunday
Everyday is silent and grey Trudging back over pebbles and sand
And a strange dust lands on your hands
And on your face
On your face 
On your face 
On your face 
Everyday is like Sunday

Share some greased tea with me
Everyday is silent and grey Why do you come here?

Everyday is silent and grey I am the son
And the heir
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
Am son heir
Of nothing in particular You shut your mouth
How can you say
I go about things the wrong way
I am human and i need to be loved
Just like everybody else does I am the son
And the heir
Of a shynees that criminally vulgar
Am son heir
Of nothing particular You shut your mouth
How can you say
I go about things the wrong way
I am human and i need to be loved
Just like everybody else does There's a club, if you'd like to go
You could meet somebody who really loves you
So you go, and you stand on your own
And you leave on your own
And you go home, and you cry
And you want to die When you say it's gonna happen "now"
Well, when exactly do you mean?
See I've already waited too long
And all my hope is gone You shut your mouth
How can you say
I go about things the wrong way
I am human and i need to be loved
Just like everybody else does There's a place in the sun for anyone
Who has the will
To chase one and I think I've found mine
Yes, I do believe I have found mine So, close your eyes
And think of someone you physically admire
And let me kiss you, oh
Let me kiss you, oh I zig-zagged all over America
And I cannot find a safety haven
Say, would you let me cry on your shoulder
I've heard that you'll try anything twice Close your eyes
And think of someone you physically admire
And let me kiss you, oh
Let me kiss you, oh But then you open your eyes
And you see someone that you physically despise
But my heart is open
My heart is open to you Something in you caused me to
take a new tack with you
You were going through something
I had just about scraped through
Why do you think I let you get away
with the things you say to me? Could it be I like you?
It's so shameful of me - I like you No one I ever knew
or have spoken to resembles you
This is good or bad
all depending on my general mood
Why do you think I let you get away
with all the things you say to me? Could it be I like you?
It's so shameful of me - I like you Magistrates who spend their lives
hiding their mistakes
They look at you and I
and envy makes them cry
Envy makes them cry Forces of containment
They shove their fat faces into mine
You and I just smile
because we're thinking the same line
Why do you think I let you get away
with all the things you say to me? Could it be I like you?
It's so shameful of me - I like you You're not right in the head
and nor am I, and this is why
You're not right in the head,
and nor am I, and this is why This is why I like you, I like you, I like you
This is why I like you, I like you, I like you
Because you're not right in the head,
and nor am I, and this is why
You're not right in the head,
and nor am I, and this is why
This is why I like you, I like you, I like you... wait a minute,bring it back
wait a minute,bring it back

There is no one on earth I'm afraid of
And no regime can buy or sell me I've been dreaming of a time when
To be English is not to be baneful
To be standing by the flag not feeling shameful
Racist or partial Irish blood, English heart, this I'm made of
There is no one on earth I'm afraid of
And I will die with both of my hands untied I've been dreaming of a time when
The English are sick to death of labor and Tories
And spit upon the name Oliver Cromwell
And denounce this royal line
That still salute him and will salute him forever Dear hero imprisoned
With all the new crimes that you are perfecting
Oh, I can't help quoting you
Because everything that you said rings true

Such things I do
Just to make myself
More attractive to you

Down the hammer
Can you see it in your heart?
All of the rumours
Keeping me grounded
I never said, I never said that they were
Completely unfounded
So when you slam
Down the hammer
Can you see it in your heart?
Can you delve so low?
And when you're standing
On my fingers
Can you see it in your heart? ...ah...
And when you try
To break my spirit
It won't work
Because there's nothing left to break
Anymore
All of the rumours
Keeping me grounded

Until my loving mouth
Is shut good and proper

Completely unfounded
And all those lies
Written lies, twisted lies
Well, they weren't lies
They weren't lies
They weren't lies

Guilt by implication
By association
I've always been true to you
In my own strange way
I've always been true to you
In my own sick way
I'll always stay true to you There's gonna be some trouble
A whole house will need re-building
And everyone I love in the house
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite soon

So ... slow ... Slow ... Off the rails I was and
Off the rails
I was happy to stay
GET OUT OF MY WAY
On the rack I was
Easy meat, and a reasonably good buy
A reasonably good buy The Piccadilly palare
Was just silly slang
Between me and the boys in my gang
"So Bona to Vada. OH YOU
Your lovely eek and
Your lovely riah" We plied an ancient trade
Where we threw all life's
Instructions away
Exchanging lies and digs (my way)
Cause in a belted coat
Oh, I secretly knew
That I hadn't a clue
(No, no. No, no, no. You can't get there that way. Follow me...) The Piccadilly palare
Was just silly slang
Between me and the boys in my gang
Exchanging palare
You wouldn't understand
Good sons like you
NEVER DO. So why do you smile
When you think about Earl's Court?
But you cry when you think of all
The battles you've fought (and lost)?
It may all end tomorrow
Or it could go on forever
In which case I'm doomed
It could go on forever
In which case I'm doomed (Bona Drag...) Tomorrow
Will it really come?
And if it does come
Will I still be human? All I ask of you is one thing that you never do
Would you put your arms around me?
I won't tell anyone
Tomorrow
Does it have to come? All I ask of you is one thing that you'll never do
Would you put your arms around me?
I won't tell anybody
Tomorrow
And what must come before Oh, the pain in my arms
Oh, the pain in my legs
Oh, my shiftless body Tomorrow
It's surely nearer now
You don't think I'll make it
I never said I wanted to
Well, did I? Oh, the pain in my arms
Oh, the pain in my legs
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
No, yeah, no, yeah
Through my shiftless body Tomorrow
Tomorrow All I ask of you, oh
Is would you tell me that you love me
Tell me, tell me that you love me
Tell me, tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Ah, I know you don't mean it
Ah, I know you don't mean it
Tell me, tell me that you love me
Tell me, tell me that you love me A small boy, big ideas
You must please remember
A long road, with no turn-off
Oh, you must remember Caught in your headlights
Like a frightened animal
You must remember 
Someone cries twice nightly
Of course, I do remember
Someone cries and you think quite rightly so
But you refuse to remember 
Caught in your headlights
Like a frightened animal
Oh, you must remember 
Oh ...
Remember, remember
Oh ...
Remember, remember 
Low-lights and long nights
I try hard to not remember
And you - too beautiful
I can't look 
I've done so very many stupid things
It's too late (remember) 
Oh ...

The closer I get
You're wasting your time
The more you ignore me
The closer I get
You're wasting your time I will be
In the bar
With my head
On the bar
I am now
A central part
Of your mind's landscape
Whether you care
Or do not
Yeah, I've made up your mind The more you ignore me
The closer I get
You're wasting your time
The more you ignore me
The closer I get
You're wasting your time Beware!
I bear more grudges
Than lonely high court judges
When you sleep
I will creep
Into your thoughts
Like a bad debt
That you can't pay
Take the easy way
And give in
Yeah, and let me in
Oh, let me in
Oh let me ...
Oh, let me in It's war
It's war
It's war
It's war
It's war... War
War
War
War
Oh, let me in
Ah, the closer I get
Ah, you're asking for it
Ah, the closer I get
Ooh, the closer I ... We hate it when our friends become successful
We hate it when our friends become successful
Oh, look at those clothes
Now look at that face, it's so old
And such a video, well
It's really laughable
Ah ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha
Oh ho ho ho
Ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha We hate it when our friends become successful
And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse and
If we can destroy them
You bet your life we will destroy them
If we can hurt them
Well, we may as well
It's really laughable
Ah ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha
Oh ho ho ho
Ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha You see, it should have been me
It could have been me
Everybody knows
Everybody says so
They say
Ah, you have loads of songs
So many songs
More songs than they could stand
Verse, chorus, middle-eight, break, fade
Just listen
La, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la I'm standing in the dark
With my innocent hand on my heart
I've changed my plea
I've changed my plea to guilty
Because freedom is wasted on me
See how you're all spoiled again Outside there is a pain
Emotional air raids exhaust in my heart
And it's safer to be inside So, I'm changing my plea
And no one can dissuade me
Because freedom is wasted on me
See how you're all spoiled again Something I have learned
If there is one thing in life I've observed
It's that everybody's got somebody
Oh no, not me
So I've changed my plea to guilty
And reason and freedom is a waste
It's a lot like life Trouble loves me
Trouble needs me
Two things
More than you do
Or would attempt to
So, console me
Otherwise, hold me
Just when it seems like
Everything's evened out
And the balance
Seems serene Trouble loves me
Walks beside me
To chide me
Not to guide me
It's still much more
Than you'll do
So, console me
Otherwise, hold me
Just when it seems like
Everything's evened out
And the balance seems serene See the fool I'll be
Still running 'round
On the flesh rampage
Still running 'round Ready with ready-wit
Still running 'round
On the flesh rampage - At your age!
Go to Soho, oh
Go to waste in
The wrong arms
Still running 'round
Trouble loves me
Seeks and finds me
To charlatanize me
Which is only
As it should be
Oh, please fulfill me
Otherwise, kill me
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it
In the half-light
So English, frowning
Then at midnight I
Can't get you out of my head
A disenchanted taste
Still running 'round
A disenchanted taste
Still running 'round He knows, he knows
Or, I think he does 'Cause when I lived
In the Arse of the world
He knows, he knows
He knows I'd love
To see him happy
Or as close as is allowed Oh, 'cause when I lived
In the Arse of the world ...
He knows, he knows
He knows I'd love
To see him happy
Or as close as possible As close as possible
As close as possible
As close as is allowed Oh, my name still conjures up deadly deeds
And a bad taste in the mouth
And the police - they actually know me
They said:
"You're just another person in the world
You're just another fool with radical views
You're just another who has maddening views
You want to turn it on its head
By staying in bed!" I said: "I know I do"
He doesn't know ... These tears I'm wailing
I spill not without reason
Remove them My dearest love
My Take me to the place I've been dreaming of
Where the grotesquely lonely
Meet the grotesquely lonely
And they whisper just very softly Please, be mine, dearest love
Be my dearest love, be my dearest love
I have hung on, hung on, hung on
For one hundred years For someone to shake me
Someone to wake me if necessary
Someone to break me My dearest love
My dearest love
My dearest love My dearest love
My dearest love
My dearest love Run, run young man, through the glen
Run young woman, through the glen

But never in my favour
But when all is said and done
It's you I love Cold loving prose
We stole each other's clothes
But when all is said and done
It's you I love
Yes, yes, yes, oh, yes... Fights for rights
Everyone's oh so quick with advice
And when they've all said their piece
It's still you I love

These modern day philistines
They stand on your hands

Any day now we'll perish
These are nervous times No one can hold a candle to you
When it comes down to virtue and truth
No one can hold a candle to you
And I dim next to you No one can hold a candle to you
When it comes down to old-fashioned virtue
Kingdom mine
Open your eyes
Make up your mind
Am I Einstein?
Or am I Frankenstein
You said blow them away
To kingdom come
Or will the kingdom be one? No one can hold a candle to you
When it comes down to virtue and truth
No one, no one can hold a candle to you
And I dim next to you Hi-ro-shima
Yes yes yes! I'm writing this to say
In a gentle way
Thank you, but no
I will live my life as I
Will undoubtfully die - alone. I'm writing this to say
In a gentle way
Thank you.
I will live my life as I...
For whether you stay
Or you stray
An inbuilt guilt
That catches up with you
And as it comes around to your place
At 5 a.m. wakes you up
And it laughs in your face Your voice, it might say no
But the heart has a will of its own
Your voice, it might say no
But the heart has a heart of its own, own It's not your birthday anymore
There's no need to be kind to you
And the will to see you smile and belong
Has now gone It's not your birthday anymore
Did you really think we meant
All of those syrupy, sentimental things
That we said? It cannot be given
And so it must be taken
It cannot be given
And so it must be taken All of the gifts that they gave can't compare in any way
To the love I am now giving to you
Right here, right now on the floor All of the gifts that they gave can't compare in any way
To the love I am now giving to you
Right here, right now on the floor It's not your birthday anymore
There's no need to be kind to you
And the will to see you smile and belong
Has now gone It's not your birthday anymore
Did you really think we meant
All of those syrupy, sentimental things
That we said yesterday? Sleep on and dream of Love
Because it's the closest you will
Get to love
Poor twisted child
So ugly, so ugly
Poor twisted child
Oh hug me, oh hug me
One November
Spawned a monster
In the shape of this child
Who'll later cry:
"But Jesus made me, so
Jesus save me from
Pity, sympathy
And people discussing me"
A frame of useless limbs
What can make GOOD
All the BAD that's been done? And if the lights were out
Could you even bear
To kiss her full on the mouth
Or anywhere?
Poor twisted child
So ugly, so ugly
Poor twisted child
Oh hug me, oh hug me
One November
Spawned a monster
In the shape of this child
Who must remain
A hostage to kindness
And the wheels underneath her
A hostage to kindness
And the wheels underneath her
A symbol of where mad, mad lovers
Must PAUSE and draw the line So sleep and dream of Love
Because it's the closest you will
Get to love
That November
Is a time
Which I must
Put OUT of my mind
Oh one fine day
LET IT BE SOON
She won't be rich or beautiful
But she'll be walking your streets
In the clothes that she went out
And chose for herself Where is London, so much for London
Is it home of the free -
Or what? Can you squeeze me
Into an empty page of your diary
And psychologically save me?
I've got faith in you I sense the power
Within the fingers
Within an hour the power
Could totally destroy me
Or, it could save my life Oh, here is London
"Home of the brash, outrageous and free"
You are repressed
But you're remarkably dressed
Is it real? And you're always busy
Really busy
Busy, busy
Oh, hairdresser on fire
All around Sloane Square
And you're just so busy
Busy, busy
Busy scissors
Oh, hairdresser on fire
All of the day. Was a client, over-cautious

Into an empty page of your diary;
And supernaturally change me?
Change me, change Oh, here in London

But I read much more into your name
Lifeguard.
Patrolling the lenght and the breadth of your pool
I call your name from the vestibule
Lifeguard Lifeguard - save me from life
Save me from life
Save me from life
Save me from the ails and the ills, and
from other things. The center of the town is a dangerous zone
Drenched in phlegm every time that I come home
Lifeguard - save me from life.
Save me from life.
Save me from life. Save me from the ails and the ills
And from other things. 
Love me, oh help me, oh
oh help me, oh help oh Lifeguard, guard me from life
Lifeguard, guard me from life. The last bus home is the dangerous one,
A baseball bat against the collarbone.
Lifeguard. Lifeguard - save me from life.
Save me from life.
Save me from life. Cause it's the only life I'll ever have,
I'm always good, I'm never bad
And I've always been so kind,
To the sick and to the partially blind. Save me from life. Late afternoon, dreaming hotel
We just had the quarrel that sent you away
I was looking for you, are you gone gone?
Called you on the phone, another dimension
Well, you never returned, oh you know what I mean
I went looking for you, are you gone, gone? Down by the ocean it was so dismal
Women all standing with a shock on their faces
Sad description, oh I was looking for you Everyone was singing, girl is washed up
On Redondo Beach and everyone is so sad
I was looking for you, are you gone gone?
Pretty little girl, everyone cried
She was the victim of sweet suicide
I went looking for you, are you gone gone? Down by the ocean it was so dismal
Women all standing with shock on their faces
Sad description, oh I was looking for you Desk clerk told me girl was washed up
Was small, an angel with apple blonde hair, now
I went looking for you, are you gone gone?
Picked up my key, didn't reply
Went to my room, started to cry
You were small, an angel, are you gone gone? Down by the ocean it was so dismal
I was just standing with shock on my face
The hearse pulled away, and the girl that had died, it was you
You'll never return into my arms 'cause you were gone gone
Never return into my arms 'cause you were gone gone
Gone gone, gone gone, good-bye Pasolini is me
'Accattone' you'll be
I entered nothing and nothing entered me
'Til you came with the key
And you did your best but As I live and breathe
You have killed me
You have killed me
Yes I walk around somehow
But you have killed me
You have killed me Piazza Cavour, what's my life for? Visconti is me
Magnani you'll never be
I entered nothing and nothing entered me
'Til you came with the key
And you did your best but As I live and breathe
You have killed me
You have killed me
Yes, I walk around somehow
But you have killed me
You have killed me Who am I that I come to be here...? As I live and breathe
You have killed me
You have killed me
Yes I walk around somehow
But you have killed me
You have killed me And there is no point saying this again
There is no point saying this again
But I forgive you, I forgive you
Always I do forgive you  Your poor witness
Crying so loudly on the floor
Oh, well, she's only trying to tell you
What it was that she saw
She is only trying to tell you
What it was that she saw Now see her standing on the table
With her small arms flailing
And you feel such compassion
In your soul for
Your mute witness
Still testing the strength
Of our patience
Oh, well she's only trying to tell you
What it was that she saw
She is only trying to tell you
What it was that she saw Now see her pointing to the Frisbee
With a memory so fuzzy
And her silent words
Describing the sight of last night
4 A.M. Northside, Clapham Common
Oh, god, what was she doing there?
Will she sketch the answer later?
Well, I will ask her
"Now dry your tears, my dear" Now see her mime in time so nicely
It would all have been so clear
If only she had never volunteered
"Your taxi is here, my dear"
La, la, la-la... It's the same old S.O.S.
But with brand new broken fortunes
And once again I turn to you
Once again I do I turn to you
It's the same old S.O.S.
But with brand new broken fortunes
I'm the same underneath
But this you, you surely knew Life is a pigsty
Life is a pigsty
Life is a pigsty
Life is a pigsty
Life, life is a pigsty
Life, life is a pigsty
Life, life is a pigsty
Life is a pigsty
And if you don't know this
Then what do you know?
Every second of my life I only live for you
And you can shoot me
And you can throw me off a train
I still maintain
I still maintain
Life, life is a pigsty
Life is a pigsty
And I'd been shifting gears all of my life
But I'm still the same underneath
This you surely knew
I can't reach you
I can't reach you
I can't reach you anymore Can you please stop time?
Can you stop the pain?
I feel too cold
And now I feel too warm again
Can you stop this pain?
Can you stop this pain?
Even now in the final hour of my life
I'm falling in love again
Again
Even now in the final hour of my life
I'm falling in love again
Again
Again
Again
I'm falling in love again
Again
Again
Again The more you ignore me
The closer I get
You're wasting your time
The more you ignore me
The closer I get
You're wasting your time I will be
In the bar
With my head
On the bar
I am now
A central part
Of your mind's landscape
Whether you care
Or do not
Yeah, I've made up your mind The more you ignore me
The closer I get
You're wasting your time
The more you ignore me
The closer I get
You're wasting your time Beware!
I bear more grudges
Than lonely high court judges
When you sleep
I will creep
Into your thoughts
Like a bad debt
That you can't pay
Take the easy way
And give in
Yeah, and let me in
Oh, let me in
Oh let me ...
Oh, let me in It's war
It's war
It's war
It's war
It's war... War
War
War
War
Oh, let me in
Ah, the closer I get
Ah, you're asking for it
Ah, the closer I get
Ooh, the closer I ... So... the choice I have made
May seem strange to you
But who asked you, anyway?
It's my life to wreck
My own way You see... to someone, somewhere, oh yeah...
Alma matters
In mind, body and soul
In part, and in whole
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah...
Alma matters
In mind, body and soul
In part, and in whole So... the life I have made
May seem wrong to you
But, I've never been surer
It's my life to ruin
My own way You see... to someone, somewhere, oh yeah...
Alma matters
In mind, body and soul
In part, and in whole
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah...
Alma matters
In mind, body and soul
In part, and in whole To someone, somewhere, oh yeah...
Alma matters
In mind, body and soul
Part, and in whole
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah...
Alma matters
In mind, body and soul
Part, and in whole
To someone, somewhere, oh yeah...
Oh yeah...
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah... A bond of trust
Has been abused
Something of value
May be lost
Give up your job
Squander your cash - be rash
Just hold on to your friends
There are more than enough
To fight and oppose
Why waste good time
Fighting the people you like
Who would fall defending your name
Don't feel so ashamed
To have friends
But now you only call me
When you're feeling depressed
When you feel happy I'm
So far from your mind
My patience is stretched
My loyalty vexed
You're losing all of your friends
Hold on to your friends
Hold on to your friends
Resist - or move on
Be mad, be rash
Smoke and explode
Sell all of your clothes
Just bear in mind:
There just might come a time
When you need some friends (Winter coming
Winter for sure, For sure
Oh, winter for sure
Winter - the snow, winter moves on) The last night on Maudlin Street
Goodbye house - goodbye stairs
I was born here, I was raised here and
I took some stick here
Love at first sight may sound trite
But it's true, you know
I could list the details
Of everything you ever wore
Or said, or how you stood that day
As we spend the last night on Maudlin Street
"Goodbye house, forever!"
I never stole a happy hour around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
He became what you see
Here I am - the ugliest man
Oh the last night on Maudlin Street
Truly I do love you
Oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
You framed beside my bed
Oh, it's childish and it's silly
But I think it's you in my room
By the bed (...yes, I told you it was silly...)
And I know I took strange pills
But I never meant to hurt you
Oh, truly I love you
Came home late one night
Everyone had gone to bed
But you know, no one stays up for you
I had sixteen stitches all around my head
The last bus I missed to Maudlin Street
So, he drove me home in the van
complaining: "Women only like me for my mind."
Don't leave your torch behind, a power-cut ahead 1972, you know
And so we crept through the park
No, I cannot steal a pair of jeans off a clothesline for you
But you without clothes
Oh I could not keep a straight face
Me - without clothes?
Well, a nation turns its back and gags.
and I'm packed
I am moving house
A half-life disappears today
With every hag waves me on
Secretly wishing me gone
Well, I will be soon
Oh - I will be soon, I will be soon.
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
They took you away in a police car
Dear Inspector - don't you know?
Don't you care? Don't you know about Love?
Your gran died and your mother died
On Maudlin Street
In pain and ashamed
With never time to say
Those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
Well, it's only bricks and mortar!
Oh. truly I love you
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
I hope you're singing now
Oh I do, I hope you're singing now Jet trails in the sky
Leave one word behind
A hand bangs into sand a name
And we all understand Everybody's Lost
But they're pretending they're not
Lost
Oh, Lost 
Jet trails in the sky
Leave one thought behind
A hand bangs into sand a name
And we all understand 
Everybody's Lost
But they're pretending they're not
Lost
Oh, Lost 
So if I see you
And I tell you
How I've watched you
I'm just Lost 
So if I see you
And I tell you
I've watched you
Don't make fun of me later
Cause I'm just Lost 
If I see you
And I tell you
How I've watched you
Don't make fun of me later
Cause I'm just Lost 
If I see you
And I tell you
How I've watched you
Don't make fun of me later
Cause I'm just Lost
Lost Lost Lost Lost Lost Lost Still drinking on the corner

Oh, but Tony,

Mouth slack and wide
Ill-housed and ill-advised
Your face is as mean
As your life has been Crash into my arms
I want you
You don't agree
But you don't refuse
I know you And I know a place
Where no-one is likely to pass
Oh, you don't care if it's late
And you don't care if you're lost
And oh, you look so tired
But tonight you've presumed too much
Too much, too much
And if it's the last thing I ever do
I'm gonna get you Crash into my arms
I want you
You don't agree
But you don't refuse
I know you (Only in the studio version):
And no one knows a thing about my life
I can come and go as I please
If I want to I can stay
Or if I want to I can leave
Nobody knows me, nobody knows me
Nobody knows me, nobody knows me
Aah, aah, nobody knows me
Aah, aah, nobody knows me
Aah, aah, nobody knows me (I need you)
Simple words
But words which had never been heard
By the soul
Stoned to death
But still living
And so he froze where he stood
And he looked to the ground
And he cried
He cried Ride our minds
If you must
But there's always a line you don't cross
Time is short
Don't be cruel
Oh you don't know the power
In what you're saying
Oh ...
And so he froze where he stood
And he looked to the ground
And he cried
He cried 
People where
I come from
They survive without feelings or blood
I never could
Was stoned to death
But I'm still living
So he froze where he stood
And he looked to the ground
And he cried
He cried So he froze
And he looked, and he looked
To the ground

He cried You're the one for me, fatty

Oh, somebody
From thinking all the time
So deeply, so bleakly?
So bleakly all the time
About everything?
(Who I am, how I ever got here)
Somebody stop me
From thinking
From thinking all the time
So bleakly, so bleakly
So bleakly all the time David, the wind blows
The wind blows
Bits of your life away
Your friends all say
Where is our boy?
Ah, we've lost our boy
But they should know
Where you've gone
Because again and again you've explained
That you're going to
Oh, you're going to
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
England for the English (England for the English) David, the wind's blown
The wind's blown
All of my dreams away
And I still say
Where is our boy?
Ah, we've lost our boy
But I should know
Why you've gone
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the National, oh
To the National
There's a country, you don't live there
But one day you would like to
And if you show them what you're made of
Oh, then you might do But David, we wonder
We wonder if the thunder
Is ever really gonna begin, begin, begin
Your mom says
I've lost my boy
But she should know
Why you've gone
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the National
To the National
To the National Front disco
Because you want the day to come sooner
You want the day to come sooner
You want the day to come sooner
When you've settled the score
Oh, the National
Oh, the National
Oh, the National
Oh, the National
Oh, the National The one I love is standing near
The one I love is everywhere
I can woo you
I can amuse you
But there is nothing I can do to make you mine
Black cloud, black cloud
The one I love roosts in the mind
Can snap this spell
Or, increase hell
I can chase you and I can catch you
But there is nothing I can do to make you mine
Black cloud, black cloud
Oh, black cloud
Oh, black cloud
I play the game of Favorites now
I can I must I will I do
I can please you
Or, I can freeze you out
But there is nothing I can do to make you mine
Black cloud, black cloud, black cloud
I can choke myself to please you
And I can sink much lower than usual
But there's nothing I can do
To make you mine You hiss and groan
and you constantly moan
but you don't ever go away.
That's because all you need is me. You roll your eyes
up to the skies
mock horrified
but you're still here
cos all you need is me There's so much destruction
all over the world,
and all you can do is complain about me. You bang your head against the wall
and say you're sick of it all
yet, you remain here
because all you need is me and then you offer your
one and only joke
and ask me
"what will I be, when I grow up to be a man"? NOTHING There's a soft voice
singing in your head
Who could this be?
I do believe it's me There's a naked man standing
laughing in your dreams.
You know who it is,
but you don't like what it means. There's so much destruction
all over the world
and all you can do is complain about me. I was a small fat child
in a council house
there was only one thing
I ever dreamed about
fate has just handed it to me AT LAST You don't like me but you love me;
either way you're wrong.
You're gonna miss me when i'm gone,
you're gonna miss me when i'm gone You don't like me but you love me;
either way you're wrong.
You're gonna miss me when i'm gone,
you're gonna miss me when i'm gone A police car and a screaming siren -
A pnuematic drill and ripped up concrete -
A baby wailing and stray dog howling -
The screech of brakes and lamplights blinking - that's entertainment.
that's entertainment. A smash of glass and the rumble of boots -
An electric train and a ripped up 'phone booth -
Paint spattered walls and the cry of a tomcat -
Lights going out and a kick in the balls - I say that's entertainment. that's entertainment. Days of speed and slow time Mondays -
Pissing down with rain on a boring Wednesday -
Watching the news and not eating your tea -
A freezing cold flat and damp on the walls - I say that's entertainment.
that's entertainment. Waking up at 6 a.m. on a cool warm morning -
Opening the windows and breathing in petrol -
An amateur band rehearsing in a nearby yard -
Watching the tele and thinking about your holidays - that's entertainment.
that's entertainment. Waking up from bad dreams and smoking cigarettes -
Cuddling a warm girl and smelling stale perfume -
A hot summers' day and sticky black tarmac -
Feeding ducks in the park and wishing you were faraway - that's entertainment.
that's entertainment. Two lovers kissing amongst the scream of midnight -
Two lovers missing the tranquility of solitude -
Getting a cab and travelling on buses -
Reading the grafitti about slashed seat affairs - that's entertainment. Mama, why did you do it?
Mama, who drove you to it? Was it the pigs in grey suits
Persecuting you?
Uncivil servants
Unconcerned at how they frighten you? Life is nothing much to lose
It's just so lonely here without you Mama, why did you do it?
Mama, who drove you to it? Spare priggish moneymen
Who scared the life out of you
Bailiffs with bad breath
I will slit their throats for you Life is nothing much to lose
It's just so lonely here without you Life is nothing much to lose
It's just so lonely here without you So we're gonna run to you
We're gonna come to you
We're gonna lie down beside you, mama We're gonna be with you
We're gonna join you
We're gonna lie down beside you, mama And we'll be safe and sheltered in our graves
We'll come before you
and we will kiss you
We'll go for one final hug, mama I am a poor freezingly cold soul
So far from where I intended to go Scavenging through life's very constant lulls
So far from where I'm determined to go Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love
But you see, I've got no charm Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold
Oh, this is very clear to you And you can tell I have never really loved
You can tell by the way I sleep all day And all of my life no one gave me anything
No one has ever given me anything My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye
You must be such a fool to pass me by I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
Having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone So now you send me your hardened 'regards'
When once you'd send me 'Love'
Sincerely I must tell you
Your mild 'best wishes'
They make me suspicious I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
Having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
The pressure to change, to move on
Was strange
And very strong
So this is why I tell you
I really do understand
Bye bye I don't mind if you forget me
No no no no no no no You can only be strong for so long
It may not eat you but it will beat you
So this is why I tell you
I really don't understand
This time Rejection is one thing
But rejection from a fool
Is cruel
Rejection is one thing
But rejection from a fool
Is cruel
And I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if you forget me Armed with wealth and good health
The best of health
In the future when all's well
I will lie down and be counted
In the future when all's well I thank you
I thank you with all of my heart
I thank you
I thank you with all of my heart
Lee, please stand up and defend me
In the future when all's well
Confront what you are afraid of
In the future when all's well Every day I play a sad game called
In the future when all's well
Living longer than I had intended
Something must have gone... right! I thank you
I thank you with all of my heart
I thank you
I thank you with all of my heart
Please, please stand up and defend me
In the future when all's well
Confront what you are afraid of
In the future when all's well Hold me closely if your will allows it
In the future when all's well
Paired-off,
Pawed till I can barely stand it
The future is ended by a long, long sleep
The future is ended by a long, long sleep
The future is ended by a long sleep You must be wondering how
The boy next door turned out
Have a care, but don't stare
Because he's still there
Lamenting policewomen, policemen
Silly women, taxmen, uniformed whores
They who wish to hurt you
Work within the law This world is full, oh
So full of crashing bores
And I must be one
'Cause no one ever turns to me to say
"Take me in your arms
Take me in your arms
and love me" You must be wondering how
The boy next door turned out
Have a care and say a prayer
Because he's still there
Lamenting policewomen, policemen,
Silly women, taxmen, uniformed whores
Educated criminals work within the law This world is full
So full of crashing bores
And I must be one
'Cause no one ever turns to me to say
"Take me in your arms
Take me in your arms and love me
And love me" What really lies
Beyond the constraints of my mind?
Could it be the sea
With fate mooning back at me?
No, it's just more lock-jawed pop-stars
Thicker than pig-shit
Nothing to convey
So scared to show intelligence
It might smear their lovely career This world, I am afraid ,
Is designed for crashing bores
I am not one
I am not one
You don't understand
You don't understand And yet you can
Take me in your arms and love me, love me
And love me
Take me in your arms and love me, love me, love me
Take me in your arms and love me
Take me in your arms and love me
Would you do, would you do what you should do? All over this town
Yes, a low wind may blow
And I can see through
Everybody's clothes With no reason
To hide these words, I feel
And no reason
To talk about the books I read
But still, I do That's 'cause I'm a
Sister I'm a
All over this town Along this way
Outside the prison gates
I love the romance of crime
And I wonder Does anybody feel
The same way I do?
And is evil just something you are
Or something you do? Sister I'm a
Sister I'm a
All over this town All over this town
They pull over
In their Citroen vans
Not to shake your hands With Meths on their breaths
And you with youth on your side
All alone, lone, alone, waiting at the lights
But not this time Sister I'm a
Sister I'm a
All over this town All
Oh
All over this town Staring in the window of the shop that never opens
Planning my selection from all the treats inside
Should I take as I desire - oh shall I, oh shall I?
Or should I hang around to be enticed inside? I'm trying to explain to myself
I can have both
I'm trying to explain to the voice inside
I can have both
I can have both
There's nobody around to say no
Who've brain-washed the small shy boy inside
He doesn't know he can have both 
Smiling through the window to the one who never serves you
I've not been feeling myself tonight
Should I take as I feel like it - well shall I, oh shall I?
Or should I wait and hope to be dragged inside?
Oh ... 
I'm trying to explain to myself
I can have both
I'm trying to explain to the voice inside
I can have both
I can have both
There's nobody around to say no
Who've brain-washed the small shy boy inside
He doesn't know he can have both 
I can have both
There's no need to choose
Because
I can have both
There's no need to choose
I can have both
There's no need to choose
Because
I can have both
There's no need to choose
I can have both
There's no need to choose A child in a curious phase
A man with sullen ways
Oh, I know very well how I got my name You think you were my first love
You think you were my first love, but you're wrong
You were the only one
Who's come and gone When thirteen years old
Who dyed his hair gold?
Oh, I know very well, I don't need to be told You think you were my first love
You think you were my first love, but you're wrong
You were the only one
Who's come and gone You were the only one
Who's come and gone I was a good kid
I wouldn't do you no harm
I was a nice kid
With a nice paper round Forgive me any pain
I may have brung to you
With God's help I know
I'll always be near to you But Jesus hurt me
When he deserted me, but
I have forgiven Jesus
For all the desire
He placed in me when there's nothing
I can do with this desire I was a good kid
Through hail and snow
I'd go just to moon you
I carried my heart in my hand
Do you understand?
Do you understand? But Jesus hurt me
When He deserted me, but
I have forgiven Jesus
For all of the love
He placed in me when there's no one
I can turn to with this love Monday - humiliation
Tuesday - suffocation
Wednesday - condescension
Thursday - is pathetic
By Friday life has killed me
By Friday life has killed me Oh pretty one
Oh pretty one Why did you give me so much desire
When there is nowhere I can go to offload this desire?
And why did you give me so much love in a loveless world
When there is no one I can turn to
To unlock all this love?
And why did you stick me in self deprecating bones and skin?
Jesus do you hate me?
Why did you stick me in self deprecating bones and skin?
Do you hate me?
Do you hate me?
Do you hate me?
Do you hate me?
Do you hate me? We're really missing you
we're really missing you
oh, and you've only just gone
Oh, well, you punched and fell
then you felt embarrassed
my heart goes out to you
so i offered love
and it was not required
oh, what else can i do?
what else can i do? we're really missing you
we're really missing you
and you've only just gone so, sunny, send at least one thoughtful letter
my heart goes out to you
tell us all how things are so much better
my heart, it left with you
what else can i do? oh, they're not forgiving you
and you're not even wrong oh, with your jean belt wrapped around your arm
oh, sunny, my heart goes out to you
and with a needle pressed onto tight skin
sunny, i cry when i see where it's taken you aah ...
i'm here, i won't move
aah ...
i'm here, i won't move
aah ...
i'm here, i will not move
aah ... I just wanna say
I haven't been away
I'm still right here
Where I always was
So one day, if you're bored
By all means call
Because you can do
(But only if you want to) I just wanna say
I haven't been away
I am still right here
Where I always was
So one day, when you're bored
By all means call
Because you can do
But you might not get through With no complications
Fifteen generations
(Of mine)
All honouring Nature
(Until I arrive)
With incredible style I'm the end of the line
The end of the family line
The end of the line No baby pulled screaming
Out into this seething whirl
By chance or whim
(Or even love)
Our family tree hacked into decline
And I'm spared the pain
Of ever saying
"Goodbye" I'm the end of the line
The end of the family line
The end of the line The decision is mine
The end of the family line
The end of the line May this lovely letter
reach its destination
if only
Question one is why do you
pretend that you like me?
Oh Phoney
See how the outside
contradicts what's inside
oooooh ooh Who can make Hitler
seem like a bus conductor?
You do, oh Phoney you do You sing a lovely song to a scale
and the words spell out my name
Oh Phoney
but then you kick me down below
cause you know it won't show
how could you? See how the outside
contradicts what's inside
oooooh ooh Who can make Hitler
seem like a bus conductor? you do oh Phoney oh Phoney you do
you do oh Phoney oh Phoney you do
you do oh Phoney oh Phoney you do He's just too good-natured and
he's got too much money and
he's got too many girlfriends

Have you seen him go, though, oh?

boy racer
boy racer, oh
we're gonna kill this pretty thing She told me she loved me
Which means
She must be insane
I've had my face dragged in
Fifteen miles of shit
And I do not, And I do not
And I do not like it
So how can anybody say
They know how I feel
The only one around here who is me
Is me They said they respect me
Which means
Their judgement is crazy
I've had my face dragged in
Fifteen miles of shit
And I do not And I do not
And I do not like it
So how can anybody say
They know how I feel
When they are they
And only I am I He said he wants to befriend me
Which means
He can't possibly know me
The voices of the real
And the imagined cry:
"The future is passing you by
The future is passing you by" So how can anybody possibly think they know how I feel?
Everybody look, see pain and walk away
And as for you in your uniform
Your smelly uniform
You think you can be rude to me
Because you wear a uniform
A smelly uniform
And so you think you can be rude to me But even I, as sick as I am, I would never be you
Even I, as sick as I am, I would never be you
Even I, sick and depraved, a traveller to the grave
I would never be you
I would never be you Spent the day in bed
Very happy I did, yes
I spent the day in bed
As the workers stay enslaved
I spent the day in bed
I'm not my type, but
I love my bed And I recommend that you Stop watching the news!
Because the news contrives to frighten you
To make you feel small and alone
To make you feel that your mind isn't your own I spent the day in bed
It's a consolation
When all my dreams
Are perfectly legal
In sheets for which I paid
I am now laid And I recommend to all of my friends that they Stop watching the news!
Because the news contrives to frighten you
To make you feel small and alone
To make you feel that your mind isn't your own Oh time, do as I wish
Time, do as I wish
Oh time, do as I wish
Time, do as I wish
Oh time, do as I wish
Time, do as I wish
Oh time, do as I wish
Do as I wish I spent the day in bed
You can please yourself
But, I spent the day in bed
Pillows like pillars
Life ends in death
So, there's nothing wrong with
Being good to yourself
Be good to yourself for once! And no bus, no boss, no rain, no train
No bus, no boss, no rain, no train
No bus, no boss, no rain, no train
No emasculation, no castration
No highway, freeway, motorway
No bus, no boss, no rain, no train
No bus, no boss, no rain, no train
No bus, no boss, no rain, no train I was bored
In a fjord
I despise the heart and soul of Scandinavia
Let the people burn
Let their children cry and die in blind asylums
But then you came along
And you held out your hand
And I fell in love with you and Scandinavia I kiss the soil
I hug the soil
I eat the soil
And I praise the God who made you Stab me in your own time in Scandinavia
Un-protesting I'll die in Scandinavia Pinned to a crime
In Trondheim
I despise each syllable in Scandinavia
Let the people burn
It's their turn
Let their children cry and die in blind asylums But then you came along
And you held out your hand
And I fell in love with you and Scandinavia I kiss the soil
I hug the soil
I eat the soil
And I praise the God who made you Stab me in your own time in Scandinavia
I will happily to die in Scandinavia Were you and he Lovers?
And would you say so if you were?
On a forecourt
On a Friday
Passing my way Oh...
Were you and he Lovers?
And if you were, then say that you were!
On a groundsheet
Under canvas
With your tent-flap
open wide A note upon his desk
"P.S. Bring Me Home And Have Me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
-Oh!-
Is THAT the best you can do?
So came his reply:
"But on the desk is where I want you!" So I ask (even though I know):
Were you and he Lovers? Used to be a sweet boy
Holding so tightly
To Daddy's hand
But that was all
In some distant land
Blazer and tie
And a big bright healthy smile
Used to make all
Of our trials worthwhile
Used to be a sweet boy
And I'm not to blame
Something went wrong
And I know
I'm not to blame
Something went wrong
Can't be to blame
Ah...

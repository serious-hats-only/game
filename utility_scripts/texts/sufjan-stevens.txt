This time of year you always disappear
You tell me not to call
You tell me not to call
And when the door is closed you're wearing different clothes
Or hiding in the paper pretending not to hear Inexpensive wine
I buy it all the time
You tell me take it back
You say you'll take a nap
But I can see it now
You always tell me how
I could do so much better
You said it in your letter Did I make you cry
on Christmas day?
Did I let you down
Like every other day?
Did I make you cry
on Christmas day?
Did I let you down
On Christmas day? The bed that isn't made
The broken window shade
The radiator's on
I loved you along
But I can see it now
You always tell me how
I could do so much better
You said it in your letter I stay awake at night
After we have a fight
I'm writing poems about you
And they aren't very nice
I didn't mean to yell
I said I couldn't tell
I only grabbed your wrist
Or would you rather we kissed? Did I make you cry
On Christmas day?
Did I make you cry
Like every other day?
Did I make you cry
On Christmas day?
Did I make you cry? Come Thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace
Streams of mercy, never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the mount, I'm fixed upon it
Mount of Thy unchanging love Here I raise my Ebenezer
Here there by Thy help I come
And I hope by Thy good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wandering from the fold of God
He to rescue me from danger
Interposed His precious blood Oh, to grace how great a debtor
Daily I? m constrained to be
Let that grace now, like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee Prone to wander, Lord I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here? s my heart, oh, take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above Come Thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace
Streams of mercy, never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the mount, I? m fixed upon it
Mount of Thy unchanging love It's been a long, long time since I've memorized your face
It's been four hours now since I've wandered through your place
And when I sleep on your couch I feel very safe
And when you bring the blankets I cover up my face
I do love you
I do love you And when you play guitar I listen to the strings buzz
The metal vibrates underneath your fingers
And when you crochet I feel mesmerized and proud
And I would say I love you, but saying it out loud is hard
So I won't say it at all
And I won't stay very long
But you are the life I needed all along 
I think of you as my brother
Although that sounds dumb
Words are futile devices Spirit of my silence I can hear you
But I'm afraid to be near you
And I don't know where to begin
And I don't know where to begin
Somewhere in the desert there's a forest
And an acre before us
But I don't know where to begin
But I don't know where to begin
Again I've lost my strength completely,
oh be near me,
Tired old mare with the wind in your hair
Amethyst and flowers on the table,
is it real or a fable?
Well I suppose a friend is a friend
And we all know how this will end
Chimney swift that finds me, be my keeper
Silhouette of the cedar
What is that song you sing for the dead?
What is that song you sing for the dead?
I see the signal searchlight strike me
in the window of my room
Well I got nothing to prove
Well I got nothing to prove
I forgive you, mother, I can hear you
And I long to be near you
But every road leads to an end
Yes every road leads to an end
Your apparition passes through me
in the willows:
Five red hensâ€”you'll never see us again
You'll never see us again I'd swim across lake Michigan
I'd sell my shoes
I'd give my body to be back again
In the rest of the room To be alone with you
To be alone with you
To be alone with you
To be alone with you You gave your body to the lonely
They took your clothes
You gave up a wife and a family
You gave your ghost To be alone with me
To be alone with me
To be alone with me
You went up on a tree
Aah, aah, aah To be alone with me
You went up on the tree
Aah, aah, aah
I've never known the man who loved me
Aah, aah, aah Shall we beat this or celebrate it?
You're not the one to talk things through
You checked your text while I masturbated
Manelich, I feel so used
Found myself on Spencer's Butte
Traced your shadow with my shoe
Empty outline changed my view
Now all of me thinks less of you
On the sheet I see your horizon
All of me pressed onto you
But in this light you look like Poseidon
I'm just a ghost you walk right through
Saw myself on Spencer's Butte
Landscape changed my point of view
Revelation may come true
Now all of me thinks less of you
(All of me wants all of you) Are we to speak, first day of the week
Stumbling words at the bar
Beauty blue eyes, my order of fries
Long Island kindness and wine
Beloved of John, I get it all wrong
I read you for some kind of poem
Covered in lines, the fossils I find
Have they no life of their own?
So can we pretend sweetly
Before the mystery ends?
I am a man with a heart that offends
with its lonely and greedy demands
There's only a shadow of me;
in a manner of speaking I'm dead
Such a waste, your beautiful face
Stumbling carpet arise
Go follow your gem, your white feathered friend
Icarus, point to the sun
If history speaks of two baby teeth
I'm painting the hills blue and red
They said beware, Lord hear my prayer:
I've wasted my throes on your head
So can we be friends sweetly
Before the mystery ends?
I love you more than the world can contain
in its lonely and ramshackle head
There's only a shadow of me;
in a manner of speaking I'm dead
I'm holding my breath
My tongue on your chest
What can be said of my heart?
If history speaks, the kiss on my cheek
Where there remains but a mark
Beloved my John, so I'll carry on
Counting my cards down to one
And when I am dead, come visit my bed
My fossil is bright in the sun
So can we contend peacefully
Before my history ends?
Jesus I need you, be near, come shield me
From fossils that fall on my head
There's only a shadow of me;
in a manner of speaking, I'm dead 2, 3, 4
Goldenrod and the 4H stone
The things I brought you
When I found out you had cancer of the bone
Your father cried on the telephone
And he drove his car into the Navy yard
Just to prove that he was sorry
In the morning, through the window shade
When the light pressed up against your shoulder blade
I could see what you were reading
All the glory that the Lord has made
And the complications you could do without
When I kissed you on the mouth
Tuesday night at the Bible study
We lift our hands and pray over your body
But nothing ever happens
I remember at Michael's house
In the living room when you kissed my neck
And I almost touched your blouse
In the morning, at the top of the stairs
When your father found out what we did that night
And you told me you were scared
All the glory when you ran outside
With your shirt tucked in and your shoes untied
And you told me not to follow you
Sunday night when I cleaned the house
I found the card where you wrote it out
With the pictures of your mother
On the floor at the great divide
With my shirt tucked in and my shoes untied
I am crying in the bathroom
In the morning when you finally go
And the nurse runs in with her head hung low
And the cardinal hits the window
In the morning in the winter shade
On the first of March, on the holiday
I thought I saw you breathing
All the glory that the Lord has made
And the complications when I see his face
In the morning in the window
All the glory when he took our place
But he took my shoulders and he shook my face
And he takes and he takes and he takes Oh, to see without my eyes
The first time that you kissed me
Boundless by the time I cried
I built your walls around me
White noise, what an awful sound
Fumbling by Rogue River
Feel my feet above the ground
Hand of God, deliver me Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
The first time that you touched me
Oh, will wonders ever cease?
Blessed be the mystery of love Lord, I no longer believe
Drowned in living waters
Cursed by the love that I received
From my brother's daughter
Like Hephaestion, who died
Alexander's lover
Now my riverbed has dried
Shall I find no other? Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
I'm running like a plover
Now I'm prone to misery
The birthmark on your shoulder reminds me How much sorrow can I take?
Blackbird on my shoulder
And what difference does it make
When this love is over?
Shall I sleep within your bed
River of unhappiness
Hold your hands upon my head
Till I breathe my last breath Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
The last time that you touched me
Oh, will wonders ever cease?
Blessed be the mystery of love I fell in love again
All things go, all things go
Drove to Chicago
All things know, all things know We sold our clothes to the state
I don't mind, I don't mind
I made a lot of mistakes
In my mind, in my mind You came to take us
All things go, all things go
To recreate us
All things grow, all things grow We had our mindset
All things know, all things know
You had to find it
All things go, all things go I drove to New York
In a van with my friend
We slept in parking lots
I don't mind, I don't mind I was in love with the place
In my mind, in my mind
I made a lot of mistakes
In my mind, in my mind You came to take us
All things go, all things go
To recreate us
All things grow, all things grow We had our mindset
All things know, all things know
You had to find it
All things go, all things go If I was crying
In the van with my friend
It was for freedom
From myself and from the land I made a lot of mistakes
I made a lot of mistakes
I made a lot of mistakes
I made a lot of mistakes You came to take us
All things go, all things go
To recreate us
All things grow, all things grow We had our mindset
All things know, all things know
You had to find it
All things go, all things go You came to take us
All things go, all things go
To recreate us
All things grow, all things grow We had our mindset
(I made a lot of mistakes)
All things know, all things know
(I made a lot of mistakes) You had to find it
(I made a lot of mistakes)
All things go, all things go
(I made a lot of mistakes) I should have known better
To see what I could see
My black shroud
Holding down my feelings
A pillar for my enemies I should have wrote a letter
And grieve what I happen to grieve
My black shroud
I never trust my feelings
I waited for the remedy
When I was three, three maybe four
She left us at that video store Be my rest, be my fantasy I'm light as a feather
I'm bright as the Oregon breeze
My black shroud
Frightened by my feelings
I only want to be a relief
No, I'm not a go-getter
The demon had a spell on me
My black shroud Captain of my feelings
The only thing I want to believe When I was three, and free to explore
I saw her face on the back of the door
Be my vest, be my fantasy
I should have known better
Nothing can be changed
The past is still the past The bridge to nowhere
I should've wrote a letter
Explaining what I feel, that empty feeling Don't back down, concentrate on seeing
The breakers in the bar, the neighbor's greeting
My brother had a daughter
The beauty that she brings, illumination
Don't back down, there is nothing left
The breakers in the bar, no reason to live
I'm a fool in the fetter
Rose of Aaron's beard, where you can reach me
Don't back down: nothing can be changed
Cantilever bridge, the drunken sailor
My brother had a daughter
The beauty that she brings, illumination The evil it spread like a fever ahead
It was night when you died, my firefly
What could I have said to raise you from the dead?
Oh could I be the sky on the fourth of July?
"Well you do enough talk
My little hawk, why do you cry?
Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?
Or the Fourth of July?
We're all gonna die."
Sitting at the bed with the halo at your head
Was it all a disguise, like Junior High
Where everything was fiction, future, and prediction
Now where am I? My fading supply
"Did you get enough love, my little dove
Why do you cry?
And I'm sorry I left, but it was for the best
Though it never felt right
My little Versailles."
The hospital asked should the body be cast
Before I say goodbye, my star in the sky
Such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth
Do you find it all right, my dragonfly?
"Shall we look at the moon, my little loon
Why do you cry?
Make the most of your life, while it is rife
While it is light
Well you do enough talk
My little hawk, why do you cry?
Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?
Or the Fourth of July?
We're all gonna die." Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
Early in the morning
our song shall rise to thee
There is a sign at the sight of theee,
Merciful and mighty
God in three Persons,
God in three Persons,
Blessed Trinity Holy, holy, holy!
Though the darkness hide thee,
Though the eye of sinful man
Thy glory may not see;
Only Thou art holy;
There is none beside thee,
Perfect in power
Perfect in power
In love, and purity Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
All thy works shall praise thy Name, in
Earth, and sky, and sea
There is a sign at the sight of theee,
There is none beside thee,
God in three Persons,
God in three Persons,
God in three Persons,
God in three Persons,
Blessed Trinity When he took the three disciples to the mountainside to pray
His countenance was modified, his clothing was aflame
Two men appeared, Moses and Elijah came
They were at his side
The prophecy, the legislation spoke
Of whenever he would die Then there came a word of what he should accomplish on the day
Then Peter spoke, to make of them a tabernacle place
A cloud appeared in glory as an accolade
They fell on the ground
A voice arrived, the voice of God
The face of God covered in a cloud What he said to them, the voice of God, the most beloved son
Consider what he says to you, consider what's to come
The prophecy was put to death, was put to death
And so will the son
And keep your word, disguise the vision
Till the time has come Lost in the cloud, a voice
Have no fear, we draw near
Lost in the cloud, a sign
Son of man, turn your ear Lost in the cloud, a voice
Lamb of God, we draw near
Lost in the cloud, a sign
Son of man, son of God Lost in the cloud, a voice
Have no fear, we draw near
Lost in the cloud, a sign
Son of man, turn your ear Lost in the cloud, a voice
Lamb of God, we draw near
Lost in the cloud, a sign
Son of man, son of God Lost in the cloud, a voice
Have no fear, we draw near
Lost in the cloud, a sign
Son of man, turn your ear Lost in the cloud, a voice
Lamb of God, we draw near
Lost in the cloud, a sign
Son of man, son of God If I missed my chance, I didn't even try
I'm not one to regret Christmas in July
If my timing is bad, like a fish on a bike,
Would you let me pretend: Christmas in July? I'm not one to admit; I'm not one to fight,
Maybe I was wrong, or maybe I was right
Like when I went to school, drinking coffee at night,
And I did what I did; now I do what I like Open the champagne, party and pensive
Your mother said it's very expensive
Do what you want to, don't even ask us
Paraguay, Boston, Philly, Damascus Maybe its the snow, the endless winter nights
And the winter coat, the one you never liked
But I'll take the sun and I'll take my kite,
Christmas on the beach, Christmas in July
And I love my friends, even if they fight
Christmas in July, just to keep them quiet
And I love you too, I love you through the night
But now that you're away, Christmas isn't right Don't take offenses; come to your senses,
Your confidence is straddling fences If I miss my chance, I didn't even try
I'm not one to regret Christmas in July Light struck from the lemon tree
What if I'd never seen
hysterical light from Eugene?
Lemon yoghurt,
remember I pulled at your shirt
I dropped the ashtray on the floor
I just wanted to be near you
Emerald Park, wonders never cease
The man who taught me to swim,
he couldn't quite say my first name
Like a father he led
community water on my head
And he called me "Subaru"
And now I want to be near you
Since I was old enough to speak
I've said it with alarm
Some part of me was lost in your sleeve
where you hid your cigarettes
No I'll never forget
I just want to be near you
Still I pray to what I cannot see
In the sprinkler I mark the evidence
known from the start
From the bed near your death,
and all the machines that made a mess
Far away the falcon flew
Now I want to be near you
What's left is only bittersweet
For the rest of my life,
admitting the best is behind me
Now I'm drunk and afraid,
vwishing the world would go away
What's the point of singing songs
If they'll never even hear you? I can see a lot of life in you
I can see a lot of bright in you
And I think the dress looks nice on you
I can see a lot of life in you I can see a bed and make it too
I can see a fireside turn blue
And I can see the lot of life in you
Yes, I can see a lot of life in you When the world looks back
when the face looks after that
I can see a lot of life in you
Yes, I can see a lot of life in you I can see a lot of life in you
I can see your bed and make it too
And I think the dress looks nice on you
Yes, I can see a lot of life in you I can see a lot of life in you
Yes, I can see a lot of life in you Once when our mother called
She had a voice of last year's cough
We passed around the phone
Sharing a word about Oregon When my turn came
I was ashamed
When my turn came
I was ashamed Once when we moved away
She came to Romulus for a day
Her Chevrolet broke down
We prayed it never be fixed or be found We touched her hair
We touched her hair
We touched her hair
We touched her hair When she had her last child
Once when she had some boyfriend somewhile
She moved away quite far
Our Grampa bought us a new VCR We watched it all night
We grew up in spite of it
We watched it all night
We grew up in spite of it We saw her once last fall
Our Grampa died in a hospital gown
She didn't seem to care
She smoked in her room and coloured her hair I was ashamed
I was ashamed of her
I was ashamed
I was ashamed of her
I was ashamed
I was ashamed of her
I was ashamed
I was ashamed
Of her The only thing that keeps me from driving this car
Half-light, jack knife into the canyon at night
Signs and wonders: Perseus aligned with the skull
Slain Medusa, Pegasus alight from us all
Do I care if I survive this?
Bury the dead where they're found
In a veil of great surprises:
I wonder did you love me at all?
The only thing that keeps me from cutting my arm
Cross hatch, warm bath, Holiday Inn after dark
Signs and wonders: water stain writing the wall
Daniel's message, blood of the moon on us all
Do I care if I despise this?
Nothing else matters, I know
In a veil of great disguises:
How do I live with your ghost?
Should I tear my eyes out now?
Everything I see returns to you somehow
Should I tear my heart out now?
Everything I feel returns to you somehow
I want to save you from your sorrow
The only reason why I continue at all
Faith in reason, I wasted my life playing dumb
Signs and wonders: sea lion caves in the dark
Blind faith, God's grace, nothing else left to impart
Do I care if I survive this?
Bury the dead where they're found
In a veil of great surprises,
hold to my head till I drown
Should I tear my eyes out now,
before I see too much?
Should I tear my arms out now?
I want to feel your touch
Should I tear my eyes out now?
Everything I see returns to you somehow
Should I tear my heart out now?
Everything I feel returns to you somehow No travel bags, no shopping malls
No candy canes, no Santa Claus
For as the day of rest draws near
It's just the two of us this year No silver bells or mistletoe
We'll kiss and watch our TV show I'll come to you, I'll sing to you
Like it's Christmas in the room
I'll dance with you, I'll laugh with you
Till it's Christmas in the room No traffic jams, no ice and storm
Far in the house the fire is warm
No Christmas tree, no great parade
It's just an ordinary day No parties planned, no place to go
It's just the two of us alone
And in the house we see a light
That comes what we feel inside I'll come to you, I'll sing to you
Like it's Christmas in the room
I'll dance with you, I'll laugh with you
Till it's Christmas in the room
Till it's Christmas in the room Oh, I can't see the day when we'll die
But I don't care to think of silence
For now I hear you laughing
The greatest joy is like the sunrise No gifts to give, they're all right here
Inside our hearts, the glorious cheer
And in the house we seek a light
That comes from what we know inside I'll come to you, I'll sing to you
Like it's Christmas in the room
I'll dance with you, I'll laugh with you
Till it's Christmas in the room I'll come to you, I'll sing to you
Like it's Christmas in the room
I'll dance with you, I'll laugh with you
Like it's Christmas in the room
Like it's Christmas in the room 2, 3, 4 I have called you children, I have called you son
What is there to answer if I'm the only one?
Morning comes in Paradise, morning comes in light
Still I must obey, still I must invite
If there's anything to say, if there's anything to do
If there's any other way, I'll do anything for you I was dressed embarrassment
I was dressed in wine
If you had a part of me, will you take your time?
Even if I come back, even if I die
Is there some idea to replace my life?
Like a father to impress
Like a mother's mourning dress
If you ever make a mess, I'll do anything for you I have called you preacher, I have called you son
If you have a father or if you haven't one
I'll do anything for you, I'll do anything for you
I'll do anything for you, I'll do anything for you
I did everything for you, I did everything for you
I did everything for you, I did everything for you
I did everything for you, I did everything for you
I did everything for you, I did everything for you I have loved you for the last time
Is it a video? Is it a video?
I have touched you for the last time
Is it a video? Is it a video? For the love, the laughter I feel up to your arms
Is it a video? Is it a video?
For the love, the laughter I feel up to your arms
Is it a video? Is it a video?
Is it a video? I have loved you for the last time
Visions of Gideon, visions of Gideon
And I have kissed you for the last time
Visions of Gideon, visions of Gideon For the love, the laughter I feel up to your arms
Is it a video? (Is it a video?) Is it a video? (Is it a video?)
For the love, the laughter I feel up to your arms
Is it a video? (Is it a video?) Is it a video? (Is it a video?)
For the love, the laughter I feel up to your arms
Visions of Gideon,
(visions of Gideon), visions of Gideon, (visions of Gideon)
For the love, the laughter I feel up to your arms
Visions of Gideon, (visions of Gideon),
visions of Gideon, (visions of Gideon), Visions of Gideon Visions of Gideon, visions of Gideon, visions of Gideon
Visions of Gideon, visions of Gideon, visions of Gideon
Visions of Gideon, (Is it a video?),
visions of Gideon, (Is it a video?), visions of Gideon
Visions of Gideon, (Is it a video?),
visions of Gideon, (Is it a video?), visions of Gideon
(Is it a video?) (Is it a video?) (Is it a video?) Vesuvius, I am here
You are all I have
Fire of fire, I'm insecure
For it is all been made to plan Though I know I will fail
I cannot be made to laugh
For in life as in death
I'd rather be burned than be living in debt Vesuvius, are you ghost
Or the symbols of light
Or a fantasy host? In your breast I carry the form
The heart of the Earth
And the weapons of warmth Vesuvius, the tragic oath
For you have destroyed
What the elegants know Oracle, I've fallen at last
But they were the feast
Of a permanent blast Vesuvius, oh, be kind
It hasn't occurred
No, it hasn't been said Sufjan, follow the path
It leads to an article of imminent death
Sufjan, follow your heart
Follow the flame or fall on the floor
Sufjan, the panic inside
The murdering ghost that you cannot ignore Vesuvius, fire of fire
Follow me now
As I favor the ghost Vesuvius, fire of fire
Follow me now
As I favor the ghost Vesuvius, fire of fire
Follow me now
As I favor the ghost Vesuvius, fire of fire
Follow me now
As I favor the ghost Vesuvius, fire of fire
Follow me now
As I favor the ghost Vesuvius, fire of fire
Follow me now
As I favor the ghost Vesuvius, fire of fire
Follow me now
As I favor the ghost Follow me now
Or follow me down
Why does it have to be so hard? Follow me now
Or follow me down
Why does it have to be so hard? Follow me now
Or follow me down
Why does it have to be so hard? It's different now I think
I wasn't older yet, I wasn't wise, I guess
Somewhere I lost whatever else I had
I wasn't over you, I see it run inside itself And then I called you out
I'm not such older than I was
Feeling it so much righter now And then I woke myself, confused
Your dress comes down to you
Don't get it wrong, don't get excited
I wanted so much to be at rest
Now that I'm older, so be it so of love The silent man comes down
All dressed in radiant colors
You see it for yourself
To demonstrate my love for you, you I thought I was so in love
Some say it wasn't true
Now that I'm older, now that I'm older
Now that I'm older, now that I'm older There's so much travel
And now that I'm older
Someone else can see it for myself
So much travel, yeah
Now that I'm older I always knew you
In your mothers arms
I have called your name
I've an idea
Placed in your mind
To be a better man
I've made a crown for you
Put it in your room
And when the bride groom comes
There will be noise
There will be glad
And a perfect bed And when you write a poem
I know the words, I know the sounds
Before you write it down
When you wear your clothes
I wear them too, I wear your shoes
And the jacket too
I always knew you
In your mothers arms
I have called you son
I've made amends
Between father and son
Or if you haven't one Rest in my arms
Sleep in my bed
There's a design
To what I did and said All that I've known to be of life
And I am gentle
You ran off with it all
And I am faithful All that I felt within my arms
And I am weightless
You ran off with it all
And I am speechless All that I said to get it right
And I am confident
You ran off with it all
And I am steadfast All that I thought to be precise
And I am consequence
You ran off with it all
And I am sorry
And I am sorry All that I've known to be at peace
And I am desperate
You ran off with it all
And I am restless All that I've known to be of love
And I am gentle
You ran off with it all
And I am desperate All that I dream
Where do you run, where do you run to?
And I am evidence All that I dream
Where do you run, where do you run to?
And I am faithless All that I dream
Where do you run, where do you run to?
Now I am messed up All that I dream
Where do you run, where do you run to?
Carrier, friend
Where do you run? Woman, tell me what you want
And I'll calm down without bleeding out
With my broken heart that you stabbed for an hour
Woman, too, I was wigging out because I want you to know My beloved, you are the lover of my impossible soul
And woman, too, promise you'll stay and put off all your woes
I was bleeding out, too much worry, I could not get you at all
And if you said what you want, I would laugh it off But I know you won't go, not for either class
Must you write it off for the impossible soul?
And I was in a dream, I was gone away without you but not too slow
For I put it off, lest I put it right for the impossible soul And all I couldn't sing, I would say it all
My love to you, if I could get you at all
Don't be a wreck, trying to be something that I wasn't at all
Seems I got it wrong, I was chasing after something that was gone To the black of night, now I know it's not what I wanted at all
I'll say something like, all you want is all the world for yourself
And all I want is the perfect love, though I know it's small
I won't hurt for its soul And all I couldn't sing, I would say it all
My love to you, if I could get you at all
Oh, oh oh oh, trying to be something that I wasn't at all
Do you want to be afraid? Do you want to be afraid? For life in the cage where courage's mate runs deep in the waves
For the scariest things are not half as enslaved
Don't be distracted, don't be distracted
Do you want to be alone? Do you want to be alone? For life isn't stained of righteousness pale
The seed and the hail, all the clouds that have left aren't interested
Don't be distracted, don't be distracted
Do you want to love me more? Do you want to love me more? For love is the breath
If water and wind is cursed
By the same thing that nurtured its shame
Is it worth all the work? Don't be distracted, don't be distracted
Have you failed to feel delight?
And have you failed to feel delight?
Instead of the love, lived tired and lost, have you left it at last Where it floundered its death with the language of ghosts?
Don't be distracted, don't be distracted
Do you want to be afraid? Do you want to be afraid? For life in the cage where
Where courage's mate runs deep in the waves
For the scariest things are not half as enslaved
Don't be distracted, don't be distracted Stupid man in the window
I couldn't be addressed
All my delight, all that mattered
I couldn't be addressed
From what I liked, from what I gathered
I couldn't be addressed
Stupid man in the window
I couldn't be addressed
(judgement, judgement) And don't be shy in the window
Come down and give your best
Oh, delight in the window
I couldn't be addressed
Stupid man in the window
I couldn't be addressed
From what I like, from what I gathered
I couldn't give my best Now I know it wasn't safe
It wasn't safe to breathe at all
Now I know it wasn't safe
It wasn't safe to breathe at all
(It wasn't safe, it wasn't safe)
Now I know it wasn't safe
It wasn't safe to breathe at all
(It wasn't safe, it wasn't safe)
Now I know it wasn't safe
It wasn't safe to speak at all (Hold on to, hold on to)
One two three four!

I never meant to cause you pain
My burden is the weight of a feather
I never meant to lead you on
I only meant to please me, however
And then you tell me "Boy, we can do much more together."
I'm nothing but a selfish worm?
I'm nothing but a privileged puppet
And did you think I'd stay the night
And did you think I'd love you forever
And then you tell me "Boy, we can do much more together."
I gotta tell you "Girl, I want nothing less than pleasure."
I gotta tell you "Boy, we made such a mess together." Our step mom, we did everything to hate her
She took us down to the edge of Decatur
We saw the lion and the kangaroo take her
Down to the river where they caught a wild alligator Sangamon River it overflowed
It caused a mudslide on the banks of the operator
Civil war skeletons in their graves,
They came up clapping in the spirit of the aviator The sound of the engines and the smell of the grain
We go riding on the abolition grain train
Steven A. Douglas was a great debater
But Abraham Lincoln was the great emancipator Chicken mobile with your rooster tail
I had my fill and I know how bad it feels
Stay awake and watch for the data
No small caterpillar, go congratulate her Denominator, go Decatur, go Decatur
(It's the great I am)
Abominate her, go Decatur, why did we hate her?
(It's the great I am) Denominator, go Decatur, anticipate her
(It's the great I am)
Appreciate her, appreciate her
Stand up and thank her Stand up and thank her
(It's the great I am)
Stand up and thank her
(It's the great I am)
Stand up and thank her
(It's the great I am)
Stand up and thank her (Oh Oh Oh Oh) It rots
(Oh Oh Oh Oh) It rots
(Oh Oh Oh Oh) It rots
(Oh Oh Oh Oh) It rots Well I have known you
For just a little while
But I feel I've known you
I feel I've seen you
When the Earth was split in fives And in your words, I
Should let it out, I
Would see you die
But I'm a watcher
I see you watch her
It's in your afterlife
This is the Age of Adz
Eternal living I'll keep from trying
I'll keep from caring
You are the lie
We see you trying to
Be something else that
You're not, we think you're nice The circumstances
Of what I thought, I
Could see it now
I wouldn't be so
I wouldn't feel so
But it's a running wild
This is the Age of Adz
Eternal living When it dies, when it dies, it rots
And when it lives, when it lives
It gives it all it's got
This is the Age of Adz
Eternal living (Oh Oh Oh Oh) It rots
(Oh Oh Oh Oh) It gives it all it's got
This is the Age of Adz
Eternal living In all reflections
I see your method
I see it all
And what about you?
And what about me?
Are we the lost of lost? Don't speak too soon, don't
Be fruit of loom, don't
Excite yourself
For what you see is
Not fantasy, it's
Not what begets, but gives
This is the Age of Adz
Eternal living In all reflections
I see it mentioned
I see it all
The gorgeous mess of
Your face impressed us
Imposed of all its art
This is the Age of Adz
Eternal living When it dies, when it dies, it rots
And when it lives, when it lives
It gives it all it's got
This is the Age of Adz
Eternal living (Oh Oh Oh Oh) It rots
(Oh Oh Oh Oh) It gives it all it's got
This is the Age of Adz
Eternal living When I die, when I die, I'll rot
But when I live, when I live
I'll give it all I've got When I die, when I die, I'll rot
But when I live, when I live
I'll give it all I've got Gloria, Gloria, it lasts
Victoria, Victoria
It lives in all of us Gloria, Gloria, it lasts (Gloria)
Victoria, Victoria
It lives in all of us I've lost the will to fight
I was not made for life
I've lost the will to fight
I was not made for life Now I have known you
For just a little while
I feel I must be wearing my welcome
I must be moving on For my intentions were good intentions
I could have loved you
I could have changed you
I wouldn't be so
I wouldn't feel so
Consumed by selfish thoughts I'm sorry if I seem self-effacing
Consumed by selfish thoughts
It's only that I still love you deeply
It's all the love I've got Melancholy creature
Paranoid secret
Hypothetic victim of prediction
I'll consume the child that trails me The youngest of children
A cannibal addiction
Innocent victim
Bite marks, body parts
When in secret siege we eat then Tell me I'm evil
A Capricorn creature
A chemical addiction
First incision
Take this body, blood shed for you Tell me I'm evil
Invisible people
Continual affection for my action
Vampire creature, first-born seeker Tell me I'm evil
Tell me I'm not the name of Love
Tell me I'm evil
Tell me I'm not the face of God Tell me I'm evil
Tell me I'm not love
Tell me I'm evil
Tell me I'm not love Where there's joy I'll bring you trespass
Where there's light I'll bring you darkness
Where there's health I'll bring affliction
Where there's hope I'll bring misfortune Tell me I'm evil
Tell me I'm not love
Tell me I'm evil
Tell me I'm not love Love
Love

The beast will arrive in time
We stayed a long, long time
We stayed a long, long time To see you
To beat you
To see you
At last I saw the dragons drying
I saw the witches whine
We stayed a long, long time
But I'm not afraid to die To see you
To meet you
To see you
At last I stole my father's shoes
I pulled his pockets too
We stayed a long, long time
We stayed a long, long time To see you
To beat you
To see you
To meet you To see you
At last I'm not afraid of the black man running
He's got it right, he's got a better life comin'
And I don't care what the Captain said
I fold it right at the top of my head
I lost my sight and the state packs in
I follow my heart and it leads me right to Jackson (Oh Keller, oh oh oh oh)
She gave us a medal she gave us a map
(Oh Canner Row, oh oh oh)
If seeing is right, then look where you're at I'm not afraid of Nichol's Park
I ride the train and I ride it after dark
And I'm not afraid to get it right
I turn around and I give it one more try
And I said things that I meant to say
The bandstand chairs and the Dewey Day Parade
I go out to the Golden Age
The spirit is right and the spirit doesn't change (Oh Keller, oh oh oh oh)
She gave us a mirror, she gave us a map
(Oh Canner Row, oh oh oh)
If seeing is right, then look where you're at Andrew Jackson! All I'm asking
Show us the wheel, and give us the wine
Raise the Banner, Jackson Hammer!
Everyone goes to the capitol line
Colored Preacher, nice to meet you!
The spirit is here, and the spirit is fine
Education! Ask the nation!
You gave us our sight and the hearing is fine
Andrew Jackson! All I'm asking
Give us the wheel, and give us the wine Lo! How a Rose e'er blooming
From tender stem hath sprung
Of Jesse's lineage coming,
As those of old have sung. It came a flower bright
Amid the cold of winter
When half-spent was the night. Isaiah 'twas foretold it,
The Rose I have in mind;
And so then we behold it,
The Virgin Mother kind. To show God's love aright
She bore to us a Savior
When half-spent was the night. Now that I fell into your arms
My only lover
Give out to give in
I search for the capsule I lost Drag me to hell
In the valley of The Dalles
Like my mother
Give wings to a stone
It's only the shadow of a cross I slept on my back
In the shade of the meadowlark
Like a champion
Get drunk to get laid
I take one more hit when you depart I'll drive that stake through the center of my heart
Lonely vampire
Inhaling its fire
I'm chasing the dragon too far There's blood on that blade
Fuck me, I'm falling apart
My assassin
Like Casper the ghost
There's no shade in the shadow of the cross He was, he was in the churchyard
My father was in the first part
He came, he came to my bedroom
But I was asleep And he woke me up again to say... Halle, halle, hallelujah
Holy, holy is the sound
And I hope, I hope you are tired out
And I know, I know there is joy endowed But I was asleep
And he woke me up again
And he woke me up again to say... Hold on, hold on to your old ways
Or put off, put off every old face
And I know, I know you are changed out
And I hope, I hope you're arranged out But I'm still asleep
And you woke me up again
And I'm still asleep
But you woke me up to be holy If you seek a pillow for your head
Or a fitted sheet for Christmas bed
If you see your shadow on the snow
Is it from the baby Jesus glow?
He's going to the country Find a tree and put it in your house
Put a mistletoe upon your mother's blouse
If you see a woman dressed in black
Give her up a song and then ask for it back
We're goin' to the country! We're goin' to the country!
You're mom's going to the country
We're goin' to the country! The country Put the lights on the tree
(Put them on the tree, put them on the tree)
Put the ribbon on the wreath
(Put it on the wreath, put it on the wreath) And call your grandma on the phone
(Call her on the phone, call her on the phone)
If she's living all alone
(If she's all alone, if she's all alone) Tell her Jesus Christ is here
(Tell her He is here, tell her He is here, tell her He is here)
Tell her she has none to fear
(There is none to fear, there is none to fear, there is none to fear) If she's crying on the phone
(Crying on the phone, crying on the phone, crying on the phone)
Tell her you are coming home
(You are coming home, you are coming home) La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
... I live in America with a pair of Payless shoes
The Upper Peninsula and the television news
I've seen my wife at the K-Mart
In strange ideas we live apart I live in a trailer home with a snowmobile, my car
The window is broken out and the interstate is far
I drove all night to find my child
In strange ideas he's been revived In strange ideas, in stranger times
I've no idea what's right sometimes
I lost my mind, I lost my life
I lost my job, I lost my wife This time of year you always disappear
You tell me not to call
You tell me not to call
And when the door is closed you're wearing different clothes
Or hiding in the paper pretending not to hear Inexpensive wine
I buy it all the time
You tell me take it back
You say you'll take a nap
But I can see it now
You always tell me how
I could do so much better
You said it in your letter Did I make you cry
on Christmas day?
Did I let you down
Like every other day?
Did I make you cry
on Christmas day?
Did I let you down
On Christmas day? The bed that isn't made
The broken window shade
The radiator's on
I loved you along
But I can see it now
You always tell me how
I could do so much better
You said it in your letter I stay awake at night
After we have a fight
I'm writing poems about you
And they aren't very nice
I didn't mean to yell
I said I couldn't tell
I only grabbed your wrist
Or would you rather we kissed? Did I make you cry
On Christmas day?
Did I make you cry
Like every other day?
Did I make you cry
On Christmas day?
Did I make you cry? Oh holy night! The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth!
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appear'd and the soul felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn! Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine
Oh night divine Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
And in His name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
Let all within us praise His holy name. Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine
Oh night divine We didn't sleep too late
There was a fire in the yard
All of the tress were in light
They had no faces to show I saw a sign in the sky
Seven swans, seven swans, seven swans
I heard a voice in my mind
I will try, I will try, I will try I will try, I will try, I will try We saw the dragon move down
My father burned into coal
My mother saw it from far
She took her purse to the bed I saw a sign in the sky
Seven horns, seven horns, seven horns
I heard a voice in my mind
I am Lord, I am Lord, I am Lord He said, I am Lord, I am Lord, I am Lord
He said, I am Lord, I am Lord, I am Lord He will take you
If you run, He will chase you
He will take you
If you run, He will chase you 'Cause He is the Lord
'Cause He is the Lord Seven swans, seven swans, seven swans
Seven swans, seven swans, seven swans To bear it down, to be in flight, to bear it down, to be in flight
It wasn't about me, it was only a stone, in my shoe
Then worries came to perch on us, impatience and our painted bus
I kept you close to me, close to my ear We set out once with folded shirts with hairy chests and well-rehearsed
I want it all, I want it all for myself
I'll set it right between your eyes, your shoulder blade, your running life
I want it all, I want it all for myself Improving all, the time I am, improving as I kissed the hem
I promise I won't be a trouble at all
For I'm okay, I'm in the red, impressions of the unmade bed
You cradle close to me, close to my ear We set out once, forget our shirts with hairy chests and all new words
I want it all, I want it all for myself
For in the earth, I smell of you, a bathing boy, amazing view
I want it all, I want it all for myself If I am alive this time next year
will I have arrived in time to share?
And mine is about as good this far
And I'm still applied to what you are And I am joining all my thoughts to you
And I'm preparing every part for you And I heard from the trees a great parade
And I heard from the hills a band was made
And will I be invited to the sound?
And will I be a part of what you've made? And I am throwing all my thoughts away
And I'm destroying every bet I've made
And I am joining all my thoughts to you
And I'm preparing every part for you Once in royal David's city
Stood a lowly cattle shed
Where a mother laid her baby
In a manger for His bed
Mary was that mother mild
Jesus Christ her little child He came down to earth from heaven
Who is God and Lord of all
And His shelter was a stable
And His cradle was a stall
With the poor, oppressed and wholly
Lived on earth our Savior holy And our eyes
At last shall see Him
Through His own redeeming love
For that child, so dear and gentle
Is our Lord in heaven above
And He leads His children along
To the place where He is gone So faithful, so few
So pardon and done
And when we receive
We give a change at last And when we are dead, we all have wings
We won't need legs to stand
And when we receive
To see a change at last Such a shame that I can't get over this
Put the axle on and roll again Such a Saturn eye will close again
Watching every ring turning again And I close my eyes
To everything you've rearranged
And I close my mind
To everything you've kept the same
Put the axle on and roll again Cannot keep you in my bed again
Wake up every time, leave your space again When the hairline breaks and lends you in
To the woman you've turned red again My blue bucket of gold
Friend, why don't you love me?
Once the myth has been told
The lens deforms it as lightning
Raise your right hand
Tell me you want me in your life
Or raise your red flag
Just when I want you in my life
Search for things to extol
Friend, the fables delight me
My blue bucket of gold
Lord, touch me with lightning
Raise your right hand
Tell me you want me in your life
Or raise your red flag
Just when I want you in my life All the time we spent in bed
Counting miles before we set
Fall in love and fall apart
Things will end before they start Sleeping on Lake Michigan
Factories and marching bands
Lose our clothes in summer time
Lose ourselves to lose our minds
In the summer heat, I might It's the same outside
Driving to the riverside
I pretend to cry
Even if I cried alone I forgot the start
Use my hands to use my heart
Even if I died alone
Even if I died alone Since the first of June
Lost my job and lost my room
I pretend to try
Even if I tried alone I forgot the part
Use my hands to use my heart
Even if I died alone
Even if I died alone
Even if I died alone
Even if I died alone
Even if I died In the delta sun, down in Arkansas
It's the great god bird with its altar call
And the sewing machine, the industrial god
On the great bayou where they saw it fall
It's the great god bird down in Arkansas And the hunters beware, o'er the fisher's fowl
And paradise might close from its safe flight flawed
It's the great god bird through it all And the watchers beware, lest they see it foal
And paradise might laugh when at last it falls
And the sewing machine, the industrial god
It's the great god bird with its altar call
Yes, it's the great god bird with its altar call
Yes, it's the great god bird through it all Tomorrow you'll see it through
The clouded out disguises put you in the room
And though I wandered out alone
A thousand lights abounded on our home
And I remember every sound it made
The clouded out disguises and the grave
So yeah I know I'm still afraid
Of letting go of choices I have made
All delighted people raise their hands And I took you by the sleeve
No other reason than to be your leading man
And you woke up with a fright
Our lives depended on the visions through the night
All we had always, all we had always wanted to before
The hurricane inclined us, grappling on the floor
All delighted people raise their hands Still the force of nature spurned
Ideas of strength and style abated by the burning basement
All delighted people raise their hands I'm not easily confused
The trouble with the storm inside us grew
But I had so much to give
In spite of all the terror and abuse All delighted people raise their hands
And the people bowed and prayed
And what difference does it make?
It doesn't matter anyway
The world surrounds us with its hate Hello darkness my old friend
I've come to strangle you in spite of what you'd like
And don't be a rascal, don't be a laughing dog in spite of odds
All I'm deciphering from the spirits in the light within
All delighted people raise their hands In restless dreams I walked alone
The clouded out disguises left me in a dream of lightness
All delighted people raise their hands And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And what difference does it make?
I love you so much anyway
And on your breast I gently laid
Your arms surround me in the lake
I am joined with you forever All delighted people raise their hands
I'm not easily confused
I feel alive I feel it glowing in the room All delighted people raise their hands
All delighted people raise their hands
All delighted people raise their hands
All delighted people raise their hands
All delighted people raise their hands
All delighted people raise their hands
All delighted people raise their hands
All delighted people raise their hands
All delighted people raise their hands Oh Father Christmas,
Come to us, come to us
Perfect and with us,
Come to us, come to us Oh Mother Mary,
Celebrate, celebrate
Brave sanctuary,
Come to us, come to us Explorations end in Christ,
Decorations left behind,
Where will you go, where will you go,
where will you go?
Troubled heart, troubled heart, here with all Oh Christian winter,
Call to us, call to us
Jupiter Winter,
Regulus, Regulus Oh star of wisdom,
Light of life, light of life
Casperous prism,
Bride of life, bride of life Disappointment to be had,
Hold your temper too my friend,
Where will you go, where will you go, where will you go?
Troubled heart, troubled heart, here with all All I had hoped for
I kept inside your car
The rabbit in the barn
Most of all I wait
I wait beside the door; I wait beside the door All I was wrong trembling in the cage
I was diamonds in the cage
In seven hours I consider death
And your father called to yell at me
You little boy, you little boy Found out you cheated me
I ran behind the barn and cut my hands somehow
Blood in the meadowlark
I punched your ears instead
I punched you in the head
You only laughed and laughed and laughed How I was wrong tingling from the kill
Tickle me until you devil bird you evil still
Slept on my arms, sleeping in the sill
I was sleeping in the room with you
You little boy, you little boy How could you run from me now?
The loneliest chime in the house
The loneliest chime in the house
You let it out you let it out
Come to me Calvary still
I'm weeding and raking until
I'm bleeding in spite of my love for you
It bruised and bruised my will Counting alluvial plains
The breathing inside of the range
You touched me inside of my cage
Beneath my shirt your hands embraced me
Come to me feathered and frayed
For I am the ugliest prey,
For I am the ugliest prey
The owl, the reckless reckless praise. You said you'd wait for me
Down by Tannery Creek
Far out by the clothesline where we used to kiss behind the sheets
Wrapped in a blanket of red
The Owl and the Tanager said
The Owl and the Tanager said
One waits until the hour is death Part I: "The Great Frontier" I count the days the Great Frontier

All things know, all things know
(I made a lot of mistakes)
You had to find it
(I made a lot of mistakes)
All things go, all things go
(I made a lot of mistakes) I know you want it
I know you really wanna get it right
Have you forsaken, have you mistaken
Me for someone else? Saturday night you sleep
With a rifle at your side
Delivering speeches
Delivering speeches left and right Follow those created deaths
Fortune save me from his wrath
Spaceship out the house at night
Prophet speak what's on your mind You know you really gotta get right with the Lord
Visit the future, visit the future from the outer space
(Space, space, space, space)
A ring of fire, a ring of fire falling on your face
(Face, face, face, face) You dream of the dark age
You dream of the dark age of your youth
Consider the danger
Consider the danger, as it moves Prophet, father, priest and king
(I know you want it, I know you really wanna)
Snake skinned master at your feet
(I know you want it, I know you really wanna) Barricade the bathroom doors
(I know you want it, I know you really wanna)
Find some things you can't ignore
(I know you want it, I know you really wanna) I know you really gotta get right with the Lord
You know you really gotta get right with the Lord I know I've caused you trouble
I know I've caused you pain
But I must do the right thing
I must do myself a favor and get real Get right with the Lord
I know I've lost my conscious, I know I've lost all shape
But I must do the right thing
I must do myself a favor and get real
Get right with the Lord I know I've always loved you
I know I've always been
But I must do the right thing
I must do myself a favor and get real
Get right with the Lord Get real, get right for you will not be distracted by the signs
Do not be distracted by them
Do your favor and get real
Get right with the Lord Get real, get right for you will not be distracted by the signs
Do not be distracted by them
Do yourself a favor and get real
Get right with the lord
Get real get right with the Lord I L L I N O I S

Sound the horn, address the city We are awaken with the ax
Night of the living dead at last

Wiping their shoulders from the earth I know, I know the nations past

Land of God, you hold and guide us
(Of having been, at last, forgot) What the water wants is hurricanes
And sailboats to ride on its back
What the water wants is sun kiss
And land to run into and back I have a fish stone burning my elbow
Reminding me to know that I'm glad
That I have a bottle filled with my old teeth
They fell out like a tear in the bag And I have a sister somewhere in Detroit
She has black hair and small hands
And I have a kettledrum
I'll hit the earth with you And I will crochet you a hat
And I have a red kite
I'll put you right in it
I'll show you the sky Bring a torch, Jeanette, Isabelle
Bring a torch, come swiftly and run
Christ is born, tell the folk of the village
Jesus is sleeping in his cradle Ah, ah, beautiful is the mother
Ah, ah, beautiful is her son Hasten now good folk of the village
Hasten now, the Christ child to see
You will find Him asleep in the manger
Quietly come, whisper softly Hush, hush, peacefully now He slumbers
Hush, hush, peacefully now He sleeps Oh life, with your shoulders in the mirror
From the park when Dakota ran and brought you there
In the car when your mother lost her temper
The catalog and the catastrophic smile Let the bugles play the sermon on the raid
I kissed you on the face
I kissed you on the playground Oh Father John, you cannot tell me
What's right and wrong
You cannot tell me
I jump before I get around you
Oh Father John Pick it up with the band on the Ronald Reagan Tollway
(Don't give up, let's go forget about yourself) Illinois in it ran from the Ronald Reagan Tollway
Forget about yourself and all your plans Oh life, with your colorful surprises
Eleanor, how you put one on disguises Oh Father John, you cannot tell me
What's right and wrong
You cannot tell me In the mortal life
Far in the morning light
We're back from Bloomington
We let the runners win Far in the morning light
We let the movies play
A weekend from the holiday Pick it up with the band
On the Ronald Reagan toll way
(Don't break down, let's go: forget about yourself) Illinois in it ran from the Ronald Reagan toll way
(If I'm wrong makes nothing right about yourself) Snowmobile on the field where the gunners throw their weight around
Forget about yourself and all your plans And the winter moves about Illinois
When my sister picks a fight
With the Alexander boy
And my father locks the car by the store
Still we figure out the keys
And follow him once more
Oh my God, we see it on the floor
The woman on the bed
The ankle brace she wore
Stones and sled
It could have been some other
The mind that knows itself
Has a mind to serve the other
But we run back, scratching at the door
Scratching at the door If I'm hiding in the sleeves of my coat
When my father runs undressed
He's pointing at my throat
And my brother has fit in the snow
And the traffic stops for miles
We take him by the elbow
Oh my God, the shuffling and the floor
A mind that knows itself
Is a mind that knows much more
So we run back, scrambling for cover
The mind that knows itself
Has a mind to kill the other
(Oh my God, no one came to our side
To carry us away from danger) Oh my God
He left us now for dead
He left us now for dead I'll talk but I know you won't listen to me
Oh, you wouldn't say it but you wanted to
Don't look, don't walk away when I am speaking
I'll take it but I know it's not for taking The oneness someone of which you notice me
I told you, do not follow what you couldn't see
Oh, I love you, I love you Some way, you will want it your way, sunrise
So I would not be mistaken what I know is right
Don't be so funny with me, I'm not laughing
Oh, I love you, I love you You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town! He's making a list
He's checking it twice
He's gonna find out
who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town! He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake Oh, you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town! He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake Oh, you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town! Watch what you're doing
Always improving
He keeps his eyes on the prize of your spirit He's in the window
Gathering info
He keeps his eyes on the prize of your personal When your heirloom's wilted brown
When the devil's pushing down
When your mourning has a sound
And you hesitate to laugh
How quickly will your joy pass
How quickly will your joy pass And when you walk inside I feel the door
I'll never let it push your arms no more
And when your legs give out just lie right down
And I will kiss you till your breath is found
And when you walk inside I feel the door
I'll never let it push your arms no more So do you think I came to fight?
And do I always think I'm right?
Oh no I never meant to be a pest to anyone this time
Oh no I only meant to be a friend to everyone this time Once a great place. Now a prison
All I can say. All I can do
People Mover: Bad Decision
From suburban. Now a prison
All I can say. All I can do From the trembling walls. It's a great idea!

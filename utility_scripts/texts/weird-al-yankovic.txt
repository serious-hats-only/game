How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a
Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten
Spot in the Caribbean by providence, impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?
The ten-dollar Founding Father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of the trading charter
Alexander Hamilton
My name is Alexander Hamilton
And there's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait, just you wait Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
I am the one thing in life I can control
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
I am inimitable
I am an original
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many have died
Then I'm willin' to— I'm willing to
Work, work!
Angelica!
Work, work!
Eliza!
And Peggy—
Look around, at how lucky we are to be alive right now!
History is happening in Manhattan and we just happen to be
In the greatest city
In the greatest city in the world! The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down Yeah you'll blow us all away Oceans rise, empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion to remind you of my love!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da da ya da! No one else was in
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
No one else was in
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
No one really knows how the game is played
The art of the trade
How the sausage gets made
We just assume that it happens
But no one else is in the room where it happens We are outgunned (What?)
Outmanned (What?)
Outnumbered
Outplanned
We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man Hamilton!
Sir, he knows what to do in a trench
Ingenuitive and fluent in French, I mean—
Hamilton!
Sir, you're gonna have to use him eventually
What's he gonna do on the bench? I mean—
Hamilton!
No one has more resilience
Or matches my practical tactical brilliance—
Hamilton!
You wanna fight for your land back?
Hamilton!
I need my right hand man back!
Uh, get ya right hand man back
You know you gotta get ya right hand man back
I mean you gotta put some thought into the letter but the sooner the better
To get your right hand man back! It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side
Look back at the Bill of Rights (Which I wrote)
The ink hasn't dried
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side—
Somebody has to stand up for the South!
Somebody has to stand up to his mouth!
If there's a fire you're trying to douse
You can't put it out from inside the house
I'm in the cabinet, I am complicit in
Watching him grabbin' at power and kiss it
If Washington isn't gon' listen
To disciplined dissidents, this is the difference:
This kid is out In New York you can be a new man How do you write like you're running out of time?
Write day and night like you're running out of time?
Ev'ry day you fight like you're running out of time
Like you're running out of time
Are you running out of time? Let me tell you what I wish I'd known
When I was young and dreamed of glory
You have no control
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story
I know that we can win
I know that greatness lies in you
But remember from here on in
History has its eyes on you (Whoa...) And I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
We gonna rise up, time to take a shot (Not throwing away my shot)
We gonna rise up, time to take a shot (Not throwing away my shot)
We're gonna rise up, rise up! (It's time to take a shot!)
Rise up, rise up!
And I am not throwing away my
Not throwing away my shot There's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait (Just wait)
What's your name, man?
Alexander (Hamilton)
Alexander (Hamilton)
Alexander (Hamilton)
Alexander A long, long time ago, in a galaxy far away
Naboo was under an attack
And I thought me and Qui-Gon Jinn
Could talk the Federation in
To maybe cutting them a little slack But their response, it didn't thrill us
They locked the doors and tried to kill us
We escaped from that gas
Then met Jar Jar and Boss Nass We took a bongo from the scene
And we went to Theed to see the Queen
We all wound up on Tatooine
That's where we found this boy Oh my my, this here Anakin guy
Maybe Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry
He left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
Sayin', "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi, soon I'm gonna be a Jedi" Did you know this junkyard slave
Isn't even old enough to shave
But he can use the Force, they say Ahh, do you see him hitting on the Queen?
Though he's just nine and she's fourteen
Yeah, he's probably gonna marry her someday Well, I know he built C-3PO
And I've heard how fast his pod can go
And we were broke, it's true
So we made a wager or two Ooh, he was a prepubescent flyin' ace
And the minute Jabba started off that race
Well, I knew who would win first place
Oh yes, it was our boy We started singin', my my, this here Anakin guy
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
Sayin', "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi, soon I'm gonna be a Jedi" Now we finally got to Coruscant
The Jedi Council we knew would want
To see how good the boy could be So we took him there and we told the tale
How his midi-chlorians were off the scale
And he might fulfill that prophecy Oh, the Council was impressed, of course
Could he bring balance, to the force?
They interviewed the kid, all training, they forbid Because Yoda sensed in him much fear
And Qui-Gon said, "Now listen here
Just stick it in your pointy ear, I still will teach this boy" He was singin'," My my, this here Anakin guy
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry"
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
Sayin', "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi, soon I'm gonna be a Jedi" We caught a ride back to Naboo
'Cause Queen Amidala wanted to
I frankly would've liked to stay We all fought in that epic war
And it wasn't long at all before
Little hotshot flew his plane and saved the day And in the end some Gunguns died
Some ships blew up and some pilots fried
A lot of folks were croakin'
The battle droids were broken And the Jedi I admire most
Met up with Darth Maul and now he's toast
Well, I'm still here and he's a ghost
I guess I'll train this boy And I was singin', my my, this here Anakin guy
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
Sayin', "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi, soon I'm gonna be a Jedi" We were singin', "My my, this here Anakin guy
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry"
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
Sayin', "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi" Your butt is wide, well mine is too
Just watch your mouth or I'll sit on you
The word is out, better treat me right
'Cause I'm the king of cellulite
Ham on, ham on, ham on whole wheat, all right My zippers bust, my buckles break

If I have one more pie a la mode

we are on fire,
we have desires,
but one is that way,
one backstreet boy is gay,
but we don't want to be mean
since now he's a queen
don't ask please
which back street boy is gay,
tell me who?
ain't saying that its AJ,
tell me who?
ain't saying that it Howie
tell me who,
i never wanna hear you say,
which Backstreet boy is gay now i can see him,
he's in women's clothes,
but he don't need an IUD, yeah
he likes Village People,
he's playing croquet,
his dog is a pekinese he is on fire,
his back, perspires
won't say, won't say won't say,
WHO'S GAY?! he's always saying,
ain't nothing but a butt ache
ain't nothing but a fruit cake
i never wanna hear you say (i don't wanna hear you say)
which one of us is gay,
tell me who?
ain't saying that it's Brian,
WHY tell me who?
ain't saying Nick or Kevin,
tell me who,
he's baking up a souffle,
which backstreet boy is gay.... Did you ever think when you eat Chinese,
It ain't pork or chicken but a fat Siamese?
Yet the food tastes great, so you don't complain.
But that's not chicken in your chicken chow mein. Seems to me I ordered sweet-and-sour pork
But Garfield's on my fork.
Hes purrin' here on my fork. There's a cat in the kettle at the Peking Moon,
The place that I eat every day at noon.
They can feed you cat and you'll never know,
Once they wrap it up in dough, boy.
They fry it real crisp in dough. Chou Lin asked if I wanted more
As he was dialin' up his buddy at the old pet store.
I said "Not today. I lost my appetite.
There's two cats in my belly and they want to fight."
I was suckin' on a Rolaid and a Tums or two,
When I swear I heard it mew, boy.
And that is when I knew, There's a cat in the kettle at the Peking Moon,
I think I gotta stop eating there at noon,
They say that it's beef or fish or pork,
But it's purrin' there on my fork,
There's a hairball on my fork Uh huh, extra cheese
Uh huh, uh huh, save a piece for me Pizza party at your house
I went just to check it out
Nineteen extra larges
What a shame no one came Just us eatin' all alone
You said, "Take the pizza home
No sense lettin' all this go to waste"
So then I faced Pizza all day and every day
This cheese 'round the clock
Is gettin' me blocked
And I sure don't care for irregularity Tell me
Why'd you have to go and make me so constipated?
'Cause right now I'd do anything to just get my bowels evacuated
In the bathroom I sit and I wait and I strain
And I sweat and I clench and I feel the pain
Oh, should I take laxatives or have my colon irrigated?
No, no, no I was feelin' pretty down
Till my girlfriend came around
We're just so alike in every way
I gotta say In fact I just thought I might
Pop the question there that night
I was kissing her so tenderly
But woe is me Who would have guessed, her family crest
I'd suddenly spy tattooed on her thigh
And son of a gun
It's just like the one on me Tell me
How was I supposed to know we were both related?
Believe me, if I knew she was my cousin we never would have dated
What to do now? Should I go ahead and propose
And get hitched and have kids with eleven toes
And move to Alabama where that kind of thing is tolerated?
No, no, no
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no) I had so much on my mind
I thought maybe I'd unwind
Try out that new roller coaster ride
And the guide Said not to stand
But that's a demand that I couldn't meet
I got on my feet and stood up instead
And knocked off my head, you see Tell me
Why'd I have to go and get myself decapitated?
This really is a major inconvenience, oh man, I really hate it
Such a drag, now can't eat, I can't breathe, I can't snore
I can't belch or yodel anymore
Can't spit or blow my nose or even read Sports Illustrated Oh no
Why'd I have to go and get myself all mutilated?
(Yeah, yeah)
I gotta tell ya, life without a head kinda makes me irritated
What a bummer, can't blink, I can't cough, I can't sneeze
But my neck is enjoyin' a pleasant breeze now
Haven't been the same since my head and I were separated
No, no, no A long, long time ago
In a galaxy far away
Naboo was under an attack
And I thought me and Qui-Gon Jinn
Could talk the federation in
To maybe cutting them a little slack
But their response, it didn't thrill us

Sayin' "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi" [Ken]
Wanna go for a ride? [Barbie]
Sure, Ken! [Ken]
Well, forget it! [Barbie]
I'm an ugly girl, my face makes you hurl
Sad I have it, I should bag it
Acne everywhere, unwanted facial hair
I'm a relation to Frankenstein's creation [Ken]
You're so ugly
You disgust me [Barbie]
I'm a bland homley girl
All alone in the world
I'm as flat as a board
Thin and lanky [Ken]
You're a dog, and a troll
Were you hit by a train?
Don't go near you
'Cause your breath is stanky [Barbie]
Don't get touched
I'm afraid
'Cause guys say
I'm an eye sore I'm an ugly girl, my face makes you hurl
Sad I have it, I should bag it
Acne everywhere, unwanted facial hair
I'm a relation to Frankenstein's creation [Ken]
You're so ugly
You disgust me [Barbie]
Boo hoo, hoo, yeah [Ken]
You're so ugly
You disgust me [Barbie]
boo,boo Oh, let's go out and have some fun! [Ken]
I'm sorry,but your too damn ugly (Barbie)
Oh screw you Ken! As I walk through the valley where I harvest my grain,
I take a look at my wife and realize she's very plain
But that's just perfect for an Amish like me
You know, I shun fancy things like electricity
At 4: 30 in the morning I'm milkin' cows
Jebediah feeds the chickens and Jacob plows... fool
And I've been milkin' and plowin' so long that
Even Ezekiel thinks that my mind is gone
I'm a man of the land, I'm into discipline
Got a Bible in my hand and a beard on my chin
But if I finish all of my chores and you finish thine
Then tonight we're gonna party like it's 1699 We been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish paradise
I've churned butter once or twice
Living in an Amish paradise
It's hard work and sacrifice
Living in an Amish paradise
We sell quilts at discount price
Living in an Amish paradise A local boy kicked me in the butt last week
I just smiled at him and turned the other cheek
I really don't care, in fact I wish him well
'Cause I'll be laughing my head off when he's burning in hell
But I ain't never punched a tourist even if he deserved it
An Amish with a 'tude? You know that's unheard of
I never wear buttons but I got a cool hat
And my homies all I agree I really look good in black... fool
If you come to visit, you'll be bored to tears
We haven't even paid the phone bill in 300 years
But we ain't really quaint, so please don't point and stare
We're just technologically impaired There's no phone, no lights, no motorcar
Not a single luxury
Like Robinson Crusoe
It's as primitive as can be We been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish paradise
We're just plain and simple guys
Living in an Amish paradise
There's no time for sin and vice
Living in an Amish paradise
We don't fight, we all play nice
Living in an Amish paradise Hitchin' up the buggy, churnin' lots of butter
Raised a barn on Monday, soon I'll raise anudder
Think you're really righteous? Think you're pure in heart?
Well, I know I'm a million times as humble as thou art
I'm the pious guy the little Amlettes wanna be like
On my knees day and night scorin' points for the afterlife
So don't be vain and don't be whiny
Or else, my brother, I might just have to get medieval on your heinie We been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish paradise
We're all crazy Mennonites
Living in an Amish paradise
There's no cops or traffic lights
Living in an Amish paradise
But you'd probably think it bites
Living in an Amish paradise Yech I never seem to finish all my food
I always get a doggie bag from the waiter
So I just keep what's still unchewed
And I take it home, save it for later But then I deal with fungal rot, bacterial formation
Microbes, enzymes, mould and oxidation
I don't care, I've got a secret trick up my sleeve
I never bother with baggies, glass jars, tupperware containers
Plastic cling wrap, really a no-brainer
I just like to keep all my flavours sealed in tight With aluminum foil (foil)
Never settle for less
That kind of wrap is just the best
To keep your sandwich nice and fresh
Stick it in your cooler (cooler)
Eat it when you're ready
But maybe you'll choose (you'll choose, you'll choose, you'll choose)
A refreshing herbal tea (sip) Mmm, lovely! Oh, by the way, I've cracked the code
I've figured out these shadow organizations
And the Illuminati know
That they're finally primed for world domination And soon you've got black helicopters comin' cross the border
Puppet masters for the New World Order
Be aware: there's always someone that's watching you
And still the government won't admit they faked the whole moon landing
Thought control rays, psychotronic scanning
Don't mind that, I'm protected cause I made this hat From aluminum foil (foil)
Wear a hat that's foil lined
In case an alien's inclined
To probe your butt or read your mind
Looks a bit peculiar ('culiar)
Seems a little crazy
But someday I'll prove (I'll prove, I'll prove, I'll prove)
There's a big conspiracy It might seem crazy, wearing stripes and plaid
I Instagram every meal I've had
All my used liquor bottles are on display
We can go to see a show, but I'll make you pay (Because I'm Tacky)
Wear my belt with suspenders and sandals with my socks
(Because I'm Tacky)
Got some new glitter Uggs and lovely pink sequined Crocs
(Because I'm Tacky)
Never let you forget some favor I did for you
(Because I'm Tacky)
If you're okay with that, then, you might just be tacky, too I meet some chick, ask her this and that
Like are you pregnant, girl, or just really fat? (What?)
Well, now I'm dropping names almost constantly
That's what Kanye West keeps telling me, here's why (Because I'm Tacky)
Wear my Ed Hardy shirt with fluorescent orange pants
(Because I'm Tacky)
Got my new resume it's printed in Comic Sans
(Because I'm Tacky)
Think it's fun threatening waiters with a bad Yelp review
(Because I'm Tacky)
If you think that's just fine, then, you're probably tacky, too Bring me shame, can't nothing
Bring me shame, can never know why
Bring me shame, can't nothing
Bring me shame, I said
Bring me shame, can't nothing
Bring me shame, it's pointless to try
Bring me shame, can't nothing
Bring me shame, I said (Because I'm Tacky)
43 Bumper Stickers and a "YOLO" license plate
(Because I'm Tacky)
Bring along my coupon book whenever I'm on a date
(Because I'm Tacky)
Practice my twerking moves in line at the DMV
(Because I'm Tacky)
Took the whole bowl of restaurant mints, hey, it said they're free
(Because I'm Tacky)
I get drunk at the bank and take off my shirt, at least
(Because I'm Tacky)
I would live-tweet a funeral, take selfies with the deceased
(Because I'm Tacky)
If I'm bitten by a zombie, I'm probably not telling you
(Because I'm Tacky)
If you don't think that's bad, guess what, then you're tacky, too

Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way Am I your fire
Your one desire

But I want it that way Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache

From the way that it used to be, yeah
No matter the distance I want you to know

I want it that way Cause I want it that way... Don't want to be a Canadian idiot
Don't want to be some beer swillin' hockey nut
And do I look like some frostbitten hosehead?
I never learned my alphabet from A to Zed They all live on donuts and moose meat
And they leave the house without packin' heat
Never even bring their guns to the mall
And you know what else is too funny
Their stupid monopoly money
Can't take 'em seriously at all Well maple syrup and snow's what they export
They treat curling just like it's a real sport
They think their silly accent is so cute
Can't understand a thing they're talking aboot Sure they got their national health care
Cheaper meds, low crime rates and clean air
Then again well they got Celine Dion
Eat their weight in Kraft macaroni
And dream of driving a Zamboni
All over Saskatchewan Don't want to be a Canadian idiot
Won't figure out the temperature in Celsius
See the map they're hovering right over us
Tell you the truth it makes me kinda nervous Always hear the same kind of story
Break their nose and they'll just say sorry
Tell me what kind of freaks are that polite?
It's gotta mean they're all up to something
So quick before they see it coming
Time for a preemptive strike What if God had long hair
And if His eyes were pretty glazed
If He looked spaced-out
Would you buy His story
Would you believe He had an eye infection
And yeah yeah
God looks baked
Yeah yeah
God smells good
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
What if God smoked cannabis
Hit the bong like some of us
Drove a tie-died micro-bus
And He subscribes to Rolling Stone
When God made this place
In the beginning, did he plant any seeds
Or did he put them there for Adam and Eve
So they'd be hungry for the apple that the snake was always offering
And yeah yeah
God rolls great
Yeah yeah
God smells good
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
What if God smoked cannabis
Do you 'spose He had a buzz
When He made the platypus
When He created both our homes
Does He like Pearl Jam or the Stones
And do you think He rolls His own
Up there in heaven on the throne
And when the saints go marching home
Maybe He sits and smokes a bone Elmo's got a gun
Elmo's got a gun
Big Bird's on the run
Ernie's dialing 9-1-1 What made Elmo snap?
Was he tired of Big Bird's crap? They say when
Elmo was arrested
They found that
Oscar's head was in the trash I hear that Gordon's
really runnin'
now that Elmo's got a gun
the street is never gonna
be the same Elmo's got a gun
Elmo's got a gun
Grover's head has come undone
Sesame Street's not real fun Weird Al Yankovic
Miscellaneous
The Saga Begins
A long long time ago
in a galaxy far away
Naboo was under an attack
And I thought me and Qui-Gon Jinn
Could talk the Federation into
Maybe cutting them a little slack
But their response, it didn't thrill us
They locked the doors and tried to kill us
We escaped from that gas
Then met Jar Jar and Boss Nass
We took a bongo from the scene
And we went to Theed to see the queen
We all wound up on Tatooine
That's where we found this boy... Oh my my, this here Anakin guy
May be Vader someday later - now he's just a small fry
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
Sayin' "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"
"Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi" Did you know this junkyard slave
Isn't even old enough to shave
But he can use the Force they say
Ahh, do you see him hitting on the queen
Though he's just nine and she's fourteen
Yeah, he's probably gonna marry her someday
Well, I know he built C-3PO
And I've heard how fast his pod can go
And we were broke, it's true
So we made a wager or two
He was a prepubescent flyin' ace
And the minute Jabba started off that race
Well, I know who would win first place
Oh yes, it was our boy We started singin'... My my, this here Anakin guy
May be Vader someday later - now he's just a small fry
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
Sayin' "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"
"Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi" Now we finally got to Coruscant
The Jedi Council we knew would want
To see how good the boy could be
So we took him there and we told the tale
How his midi-chlorians were off the scale
And he might fulfill that prophecy
Oh, the Council was impressed, of course
Could he bring balance to the Force?
They interviewed the kid
Oh, training they forbid
Because Yoda sensed in him much fear
And Qui-Gon said, "Now listen here
Just stick it in your pointy ear
I still will teach this boy" He was singin'... My my, this here Anakin guy
May be Vader someday later - now he's just a small fry
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
Sayin' "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"
"Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi" We caught a ride back to Naboo
'Cause Queen Amidala wanted to
I frankly would've liked to stay
We all fought in that epic war
And it wasn't long at all before
Little Hotshot flew his plane and saved the day
And in the end some Gungans died
Some ships blew up and some pilots fried
A lot of folks were croakin'
The battle droids were broken
And the Jedi I admire most
Met up with Darth Maul and now he's toast
Well, I'm still here and he's a ghost
I guess I'll train this boy 
And I was singin'... My my, this here Anakin guy
May be Vader someday later - now he's just a small fry
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
Sayin' "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"
"Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"
We were singin'... My my, this here Anakin guy
May be Vader someday later - now he's just a small fry
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
Sayin' "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi" They see me mowin'
My front lawn

Where it bubbles all the time like a giant carbonated soda
S O D A, soda I saw the little runt sitting there on a log
I asked him his name and in a raspy voice he said, "Yoda"
Y O D A, Yoda
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda Well, I've been around, but I ain't never seen
A guy who looks like a muppet, but he's wrinkled and green
Oh, my Yoda
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda Well, I'm not dumb, but I can't understand
How he can lift me in the air just by raising his hand
Oh, my Yoda
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda, yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda Well, I left home just a week before
And I've never ever been a jedi before
But Obi Wan, he set me straight, of course
He said, "Go to Yoda and he'll show you the force" Well, I'm not the kind that would argue with Ben
So it looks like I'm gonna start all over again
Though with my Yoda
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda, yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda
Yoda
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda, yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda So I used the force
I picked up a box
I lifted some rocks
While I stood on my head
Well, I won't forget what Yoda said He said, "Luke, stay away from the darker side
And if you start to go astray, let the force be your guide"
Oh, my Yoda
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda I know Darth Vader's really got you annoyed
But remember, if you kill him, then you'll be unemployed
Oh, my Yoda
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda Well, I heard my friends really got in a mess
So I'm gonna have to leave Yoda I guess
But I know that I'll be coming back some day
I'll be playing this part 'till I'm old and gray The long-term contract I had to sign
Says I'll be making these movies till the end of time
With my Yoda
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda, yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda Yoda

Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda, yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda How come you're always such a fussy young man?
Don't want no Captain Crunch, don't want no Raisin Bran
Well, don't you know that other kids are starving in Japan?
So eat it, just eat it Don't wanna argue, I don't wanna debate
Don't wanna hear about what kind of food you hate
You won't get no dessert 'till you clean off your plate
So eat it Don't you tell me you're full
Just eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it
Get yourself an egg and beat it
Have some more chicken, have some more pie
It doesn't matter if it's broiled or fried Just eat it, eat it, just eat it, eat it
Just eat it, eat it, just eat it, eat it, ooh Your table manners are a cryin' shame
You're playin' with your food, this ain't some kind of game
Now, if you starve to death, you'll just have yourself to blame
So eat it, just eat it You better listen, better do what you're told
You haven't even touched your tuna casserole
You better chow down or it's gonna get cold
So eat it I don't care if you're full
Just eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it
Open up your mouth and feed it
Have some more yogurt, have some more Spam
It doesn't matter if it's fresh or canned Just eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it
Don't you make me repeat it
Have a banana, have a whole bunch
It doesn't matter what you had for lunch
Just eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it
Eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it Eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it
If it's gettin' cold, reheat it
Have a big dinner, have a light snack If you don't like it, you can't send it back
Just eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it
Get yourself an egg and beat it
(Oh Lord)
Have some more chicken, have some more pie
It doesn't matter if it's broiled or fried
Just eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it
Don't you make me repeat it
(Oh no)
Have a banana, have a whole bunch
It doesn't matter what you had for lunch I recall the time they found those fossilized mosquitoes
And before long, they were cloning DNA
Now I'm being chased by some irate velociraptors
Well, believe me this has been one lousy day Jurassic Park is frightening in the dark
All the dinosaurs are running wild
Someone shut the fence off in the rain
I admit it's kinda eerie
But this proves my chaos theory
And I don't think I'll be coming back again, oh no! I cannot approve of this attraction
'Cause getting disemboweled always makes me kinda mad
A huge tyrannosaurus ate our lawyer
Well, I suppose that proves they're really not all bad Jurassic Park is frightening in the dark
All the dinosaurs are running wild
Someone let T- Rex out of his pen
I'm afraid those things'll harm me
'Cause they sure don't act like Barney
And they think that I'm their dinner, not their friend, oh no! Jurassic Park is frightening in the dark
All the dinosaurs are running wild
What a crummy weekend this has been
Well, this sure ain't no e-ticket
Think I'll tell them where to stick it
'Cause I'm never coming back this way again, oh no, oh no! Yeah

Make my boobies one more size. -- Instrumental break -- Boobies, I lie about you.
I'll make up something! I'll say they grew! Boobies! When I jump around,
They keep on moving, each one weighs 15 pounds! I did not have surgery!
My chest is growing, it's just puberty. They grew like crazy! I was asleep.
I was an A-cup, now I am a D. They grew like crazy! (spoken) You believe me, right?
My boobies got so huge almost overnight. They grew like crazy! Those things ain't cheap.
I'm so inflated unless they leak. They grew like crazy! (spoken) You believe me, right?
My boobies got so huge almost overnight. Uh huh, extra cheese
Uh huh, uh huh, save a piece for me Pizza party at your house
I went just to check it out
Nineteen extra larges
What a shame no one came Just us eatin' all alone
You said, "Take the pizza home
No sense lettin' all this go to waste"
So then I faced Pizza all day and every day
This cheese 'round the clock
Is gettin' me blocked
And I sure don't care for irregularity Tell me
Why'd you have to go and make me so constipated?
'Cause right now I'd do anything to just get my bowels evacuated
In the bathroom I sit and I wait and I strain
And I sweat and I clench and I feel the pain
Oh, should I take laxatives or have my colon irrigated?
No, no, no I was feelin' pretty down
Till my girlfriend came around
We're just so alike in every way
I gotta say In fact I just thought I might
Pop the question there that night
I was kissing her so tenderly
But woe is me Who would have guessed, her family crest
I'd suddenly spy tattooed on her thigh
And son of a gun
It's just like the one on me Tell me
How was I supposed to know we were both related?
Believe me, if I knew she was my cousin we never would have dated
What to do now? Should I go ahead and propose
And get hitched and have kids with eleven toes
And move to Alabama where that kind of thing is tolerated?
No, no, no
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no) I had so much on my mind
I thought maybe I'd unwind
Try out that new roller coaster ride
And the guide Said not to stand
But that's a demand that I couldn't meet
I got on my feet and stood up instead
And knocked off my head, you see Tell me
Why'd I have to go and get myself decapitated?
This really is a major inconvenience, oh man, I really hate it
Such a drag, now can't eat, I can't breathe, I can't snore
I can't belch or yodel anymore
Can't spit or blow my nose or even read Sports Illustrated Oh no
Why'd I have to go and get myself all mutilated?
(Yeah, yeah)
I gotta tell ya, life without a head kinda makes me irritated
What a bummer, can't blink, I can't cough, I can't sneeze
But my neck is enjoyin' a pleasant breeze now
Haven't been the same since my head and I were separated
No, no, no This thing right here,
It's to all the wives and girlfriends know what we guys are worried about, you know,
How lovely ladies don't get to the gym to much,
And now summers here, watch out Oo that dress too small for you,
Looks like you put another pound or two,
So you you shakin that thang like your all that,
Take a look at yourself coz you're all fat (uh),
You like to eat at the ice-cream shops,
And you cruise to the mall for some tipping docs,
Not to much food coz your jeans will pop,
I really hate when you bend over! She had a big old butt (butt, butt),
Thighs like a truck (truck, truck),
Babe how'd you got (got, got),
I think I see her again,
She had a big old butt (butt, butt),
Thighs like a truck (truck, truck),
Like King Kong! (Please don't wear your thoooong)
Listen when I say so (ah ah ah ah),
Been watchin that booty grow (ah ah ah ah),
Show some self control (ah ah ah ah),
Don't wear your thong thong thong,
Sorry but I told you so (ah ah ah ah),
Been watchin that booty grow (ah ah ah ah),
It shows off your belly roll (ah ah ah ah),
Don't wear the thong thong thong (come on), Ooh your butt's dry can't you win,
And you know another brother will stand for it,
It's like a wrecking ball, so big and round,
If I get too close, it might knock me down (uh),
It's hard to find a vacation spot,
With a cruise you could lose cough a drilling hot,
She's on the the beach and she should be stuck,
Coz she was trying to tan all over! She had a big old butt (butt, butt),
Thighs like a truck (truck, truck),
Babe how'd you got (got, got),
I think I see her again,
She had a big old butt (butt, butt),
Thighs like a truck (truck, truck),
Like King Kong! (Please don't wear your thoooong)

Sometimes you don't
Peter Paul Almond Joy's got nuts
Mounds don't Everybody shut up, WOO!
Everyone listen up!
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey If you can't write in the proper way
If you don't know how to conjugate
Maybe you flunked that class
And maybe now you find
That people mock you online Okay, now here's the deal
I'll try to educate ya
Gonna familiarize
You with the nomenclature
You'll learn the definitions
Of nouns and prepositions
Literacy's your mission And that's why I think it's a good time
To learn some grammar
Now, did I stammer
Work on that grammar
You should know when
It's "less" or it's "fewer"
Like people who were
Never raised in a sewer I hate these word crimes
Like I could care less
That means you do care
At least a little
Don't be a moron
You'd better slow down
And use the right pronoun
Show the world you're no clown Say you got a "It"
Followed by apostrophe, "s"
Now what does that mean?
You would not use "it's" in this case
As a possessive
It's a contraction
What's a contraction?
Well, it's the shortening of a word, or a group of words
By the omission of a sound or letter Okay, now here's some notes
Syntax you're always mangling
No X in "Espresso"
Your participle's danglin'
But I don't want your drama
If you really wanna
Leave out that Oxford comma Just keep in mind that
"be", "see", "are", "you"
Are words, not letters
Get it together
Use your spellchecker
You should never
Write words using numbers
Unless you're seven
Or your name is Prince I hate these word crimes
You really need a
Full-time proofreader
You dumb mouthbreather
Well, you should hire
Some cunning linguist
To help you distinguish
What is proper English One thing I ask of you
Time to learn your homophones is past due
Learn to diagram a sentence too
Always say to whom
Don't ever say to who
And listen up when I tell you this
I hope you never use quotation marks for emphasis
You finished second grade
I hope you can tell
If you're doing good or doing well
Figure out the difference
Irony is not coincidence
And, I thought that you'd gotten it through your skull
What's figurative and what's literal
Oh but, just now, you said
You "literally couldn't get out of bed"
That really makes me want to literally
Smack a crowbar upside your stupid head I read your e-mail
It's quite apparent
Your grammar's errant
You're incoherent
Saw your blog post
It's really fantastic
That was sarcastic (Oh, psych!)
'Cause you write like a spastic I hate these Word Crimes
Your prose is dopey
Think you should only
Write in emoji
Oh, you're a lost cause
Go back to preschool
Get out of the gene pool
Try your best to not drool Never mind, I give up
Really now, I give up
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

Yeah i moved out to langely recently
with a plain and simple dream;
wanna infiltrate some third-world place
and topple their regime. their men in black with their matching suitcases;
where everything's on a need-to-know basis;
agents got that swagger;
everyone so cloak and dagger. i'm feelin' nervous but i'm really kinda wishing
for another undercover mission that's when the red alert came on the radio
and i put my earpiece on!
got my dark sunglasses on!
and i had my weapon drawn! so i get my handcuffs,
my cyanide pills,
my classified dossier! tappin' the phones like yeah, shreddin' the files like yeah,
and then i memorised all the enemy spies i've gotta neutralize today. yeeeaaahhh, it's a party in the cia!
yeeeaaahhh, it's a party in the cia! i've done a couple of crazy things that have almost got me dismissed,
like terminate some head of state who wasn't even on my list. burn that microfilm buddy, will you, i'd tell you why but then i'd have to kill you! you need a quickie confession?
we'll start a waterboarding session! no hurry on this south american dictator
i'll assassinate him later
that's when he walked right in my laser sights,
and my silencer was on,
and my silencer was on,
and another target's gone! yeah, we've got our black ops all over the world, from Kazakhstan to Bombay;
payin' the bribes like yeah, pluggin' the leaks like yeah;
interrogating the scum of the earth, we'll break them by the break of day! yeeeaaahhh, it's a party in the cia!

we only torture the folks we don't like,
you're probably going to be ok! yeeeaaahhh, it's a party in the cia!
yeeeaaahhh, it's a party in the cia! Your sports team is vastly inferior
That simple fact is plainly obvious to see
We're gonna kick your collective posterior
Of course you realize we're speaking figuratively
Our stats are thoroughly impressive
Our coach really has the Midas touch
Our players are fast and strong and brave
And your guys, eh, not so much In fact we've played teams across the nation
And you're the worst one we've come across
Try to assimilate that information
And it just might help you cope with your impending loss
Oh, and if somehow we are still failing
To effectively articulate the points at hand
Allow us now to summarize them in a manner
That your feeble brains can understand We're great (We're great)
And you suck (You suck)
We're great (We're great)
And you suck (You suck)
We're great (We're great)
And you suck (You suck)
You see there's us (We're great)
And then there's you (You suck)
We're really, really great (Really great)
In contrast, you really suck (Really suck)
Okay, full disclosure, we're not that great
But nevertheless, you suck Your sports team will soon suffer swift defeat
That theory's back by empirical evidence
We're gonna grind up your guys into burger meat
Again, of course, we're speaking in the figurative sense
What's the use of even going through the motions
When you know that you're gonna lose anyhow
So why don't you save us all some time
And give up now (You suck!) What is this song all about? Can't figure any lyrics out
How do the words to it go? I wish you'd tell me, I don't know Don't know, don't know, don't know, oh no
Don't know, don't know, don't know Now I'm mumblin' and I'm screamin' and I don't know what I'm singin'
Crank the volume, ears are bleedin', I still don't know what I'm singin'
We're so loud and incoherent, boy, this oughta bug your parents, yeah It's unintelligible, I just can't get it through my skull
It's hard to bargle nawdle zouss with all these marbles in my mouth Don't know, don't know, don't know, oh no

A garage band from Seattle, well it sure beats raisin' cattle, yeah And I forgot the next, oh well, I guess it pays to rehearse

Don't know, don't know, don't know Well, I'm yellin' and we're playin' but I don't know what I'm sayin'

Down at the beach, I'm a lucky man
I'm the only one who gets a tan
If I have one more pie a la mode
I'm gonna need my own ZIP code When you're only havin' seconds
I'm havin' twenty thirds
When I go to get my shoes shined

Your Windows boots up in what, a day and a half?
You could back up your whole hard drive on a floppy diskette
You're the biggest joke on the Internet Your database is a disaster
You're waxin' your modem, tryin' to make it go faster
Hey fella, I bet you're still livin' in your parents' cellar
Downloadin' pictures of Sarah Michelle Gellar

They call me the king of the spreadsheets
Got 'em printed out on my bedsheets
My new computer's got the clocks, it rocks
But it was obsolete before I opened the box You say you've had your desktop for over a week?
Throw that junk away, man, it's an antique
Your laptop is a month old, well that's great
If you could use a nice, heavy paperweight
My digital media is write-protected
Every file inspected, no viruses detected
I beta tested every operation system
Gave props to some, and others, I dissed 'em While your computer's crashin', mine's multitaskin'
It does all my work without me even askin'
Got a flat-screen monitor forty inches wide wide
I believe that your says 'Etch-A-Sketch' on the side
In a 32-bit world, you're a 2-bit user
You've got your own newsgroup, 'Alt.total-loser'
Your motherboard melts when you try to send a fax
Where'd you get your CPU, in a box of Cracker Jacks?
Play me online? Well, you know that I'll beat you
If I ever meet you I'll control-alt-delete you It's all about the Pentiums, baby

Really wanna give you a warning
'Cause I found out this morning
About a dangerous, insidious computer virus
If you should get an email with the subject, 'stinky cheese'

Under no circumstances, should you open it
Or else it will Translate your documents into Swahili
Make your TV record "Gigli"
Neuter your pets, and give you laundry static cling
Look out!
It's gonna make your computer screen freeze
Look out!
Erase the Easter eggs off your DVDs
Look out!
Erase your hard drive and your backups too
And the hard drive of anyone related to you Virus alert!
Delete immediately before someone gets hurt!
Forward this message on to everybody Soon, very soon, it will make all the paint peel off your walls
It'll make your keyboard all sticky
Give your poodle a hickey
And invest your cash in stock in Euro Disney
Then, it will tie up your phone, making crank long-distance calls
It'll set your clocks back an hour and start clogging the shower
So just trash it now, or else it will Decide to give you a permanent wedgie,
Legally change your name to Reggie,
Even mess up the pH balance in your pool Look out!
It's gonna melt your face right off your skull
Look out!
And make your iPod only play Jethro Tull
Look out!
And tell you knock-knock jokes while you're trying to sleep
Look out! And make you physically attracted to sheep
Look out!
Steal your identity and your credit cards
Look out!
Buy you a warehouse full of pink leotards
Look out!
Then cause a major rift in time and space
And leave a bunch of Twinkie wrappers all over the place
That's right it's a... Virus alert!

Bury it completely; rocks and boulders should be fine

Then I filled up on bread, didn't leave any room for tiramisu
Oh no, there's a pixel out in the corner of my laptop screen
I don't have any bills in my wallet small enough for the vending machine
Some idiot just called me up on the phone, what!? Don't they know how to text? OMG!

Dancing around in a do-si-do
The purple monstrosity was waving his arms
We were falling victim to his evil charms
He brushed against a candle and he started to smoke
And now we're all laughing at the dinosaur joke Oh boy, Barney's on fire!
It's what we've always desired
We'll watch the flames get higher
Just don't try to put him out [kids sayin "kill him" in the background]
Purple fur was flying ashes everywhere
And all of the kids just continued to stare
The guy inside the suit, he started to yell
We probably should've helped him but what the hell
He threw himself violently against the wall
He fell to his knees and he tried to crawl away Oh Boy, Barney's on fire!
This is our secret desire
We'll hell the flames burn higher
But don't you try to put him out ("break it down for me fellas!") Barney: I love you...you love me (Barney Screaming) Oh boy, Barney's on fire!
This is what we've always desired
Want your help but stand the flames higher
And you better not try to put him out.. Barney's no longer ignited
We're feeling somewhat slighted
He's laying in a heap on the floor
We poked him with a stick cause we had to be sure he was dead. Sidius:
It's not the east or the west side.
Vader: No its not
Sidius: It's not the north or the south side.
Vader: No its not
Sidius: It's the Dark side
Vader: You are correct
Sidius: Keep frontin' the Empire, to all you Vader haters out there, we'll blow your planet up!
Vader:
What is thy bidding my master?
Sidius:
It's a disaster, Skywalker we're after

What if he could be turned to the dark side-

Yes, he'd be a powerful ally, another dark jedi...

And the place was pretty packed, yeah
Couldn't find a seat so I had to stand
With the perverts in the back
It was smellin' like a locker room
There was junk all over the floor
We're already packed in like sardines
But we're stoppin' to pick up more, look out
Another one rides the bus, another one rides the bus
Another comes on and another comes on
Another one rides the bus
Hey, he's gonna sit by you, another one rides the bus
There's a suitcase pokin' me in the ribs
There's an elbow in my ear
There's a smelly old bum standin' next to me
Hasn't showered in a year
I think I'm missin' a contact lens
I think my wallet's gone
And I think this bus is stoppin' again
To let a couple more freaks get on, look out
Another one rides the bus, another one rides the bus
Another comes on and another comes on
Another one rides the bus
Hey, he's gonna sit by you, another one rides the bus
Yeah, another one rides the bus
Another one rides the bus ow
Another one rides the bus, hey, hey
Another one rides the bus hey
The window doesn't open and the fan is broke
And my face is turnin' blue, yeah
I haven't been in a crowd like this
Since I went to see 'The Who'
Well, I should've got off a couple miles ago
But I couldn't get to the door
There isn't any room for me to breathe
And now we're gonna pick up more, yeah
Another one rides the bus, another one rides the bus
Another comes on and another comes on
Another one rides the bus
Hey, he's gonna sit by you, another one rides the bus, oh, yeah I'm drivin' a truck, drivin' a big ol' truck
Pedal to the metal hope I don't run outta luck
Rollin' down the highway until the break of dawn
Drivin' a truck with my high heels on
My deisel rig is northward bound
It's time to put that hammer down
Just watchin' as the miles go flying by
I'm ridin' twenty tons of steel
But it's sure hard to hold the wheel
While I'm still waitin' for my nails to dry
Oh I always gotta check my lipstick in that rear-view mirrow
And my pink angora sweater fits so tight
I'm jammin' gears and haulin' freight
Well I sure hope my seams are straight
Lord don't let my mascara run tonight
Because I'm drivin' a truck, drivin' a big ol' truck
Smokey's on my tail and my accelerator's stuck
Got these eighteen wheels a-rollin' until the break of dawn
Drivin' a truck with my high heels on
Oh I don't mind when my crotchless panties creep right up on me
And my nipple rings don't bother me too much
But when I hit those big speed bumps
My darlin' little rhinestone pumps
Keep fallin' off the mother-loving clutch
But still I'm drivin' a truck, drivin' a big ol' truck
Headin' down the interstate just tryin' to make a buck
Wearin' feathered boas with sequins and chiffon
While I'm drivin' a truck with my high heels on
I'm drivin' a truck, drivin' a truck
Got a load to carry and some eyebrows left to pluck
And I'm late for my appointment down at the hair salon
So I'll be drivin' a truck with my high heels on
{my high heels on) I'm waking up, in Cheeto dust
My belly's covered with pizza crust
I'm using my inhaler now (Wheezes)
I'm out of shape, fattening up
I'm sipping Coke from a Solo Cup
Donut crumbs are upon my lips, whoa The TV's on, I really hate this show
I can't reach my remote control
Welcome to my new place, to my new place
Sorry it's a cramped space, but it's my place
Whoa oh, whoa I'm, really inactive, I'm so inactive
Whoa oh, whoa I'm, really inactive, highly inactive My muscle's gone, I'm atrophied
Always lose my fight with gravity
I rest my bones, and just chillax, whoa
My NordicTrack's, collecting dust
And my StairMaster's a pile of rust
This is it, The Inertia I can't get up, this couch is part of me
I'm growing cobwebs on my knee
Pretty sad for my age, sad for my age
I could break my rib cage, here is my age
Whoa oh, whoa I'm, really inactive, yes, quite inactive
Whoa oh, whoa I'm, really inactive, not very active Near comatose, no exercise
Don't tag my toe, I'm still alive I'm giving up, my energy is shot
I'm never moving from this spot
Never move from this place, move from this place
I'll stay here in this place, right in this place
Whoa oh, whoa I'm, really inactive, just so inactive
Whoa oh, whoa I'm, really inactive, not so attractive Watch this These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
I came up with more secrets to tell you today
These are my confessions
Slipped my mind the last two times, silly me
So now I gotta give you part three of my confessions First I told you 'bout the skank that I was cheatin' with
Then I mentioned she's havin' my kid
That's not all, now I recall more, you see
So I'll give you part three of my confessions Now this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Gonna tell you everything I left out of parts one and two
Like, remember when I told you that I knew Pauley Shore
Pauley Shore, that's a lie, I don't know what I said that for I borrowed your ChapStick from you without asking
Oh, and I tried out your nose hair trimmer too
And by the way, your "diamond" ring is cubic zirconium
I killed your goldfish accidentally, just replaced it with another one These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
I need to get some things off my chest right away
These are my confessions
Slipped my mind the last two times, silly me
Now I guess I gotta give you part three of my confessions Threw up on your dog last time I had too much to drink
There've been times when I peed in your sink
Don't know why but you and I should agree
That belongs in part three of my confessions Baby forgive me I'm still trying to figure out
Why I used your toothbrush to clean off the bathroom grout
Oh, and sometimes in private
Really like to dress up like Shirley Temple
And spank myself with a hockey stick My boss thinks I'm a jerk, didn't get that raise
I haven't changed my underwear in twenty-seven days
And when I'm kissing you I fantasize you're a midget
I'm so sorry Debbie, I mean Bridget These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
I got a few more secrets I'd like to convey
These are my confessions
Slipped my mind the last two times, silly me
Now I guess I gotta give you part three of my confessions Gave you buttered toast I dropped and picked up off the floor
FYI, it was not a cold sore
(Not a cold sore)
Whoops, my bad
(Hope you're not sore at me)
But you'll be madder at me when I finish part three of my confessions You don't know how hard it is for me to tell you this
But you remember that shirt you got me for my birthday?
Well, I returned it for store credit
That thing was hideous, what were you thinking?
Oh, by the way, I wasn't really sick last week
I just didn't want to go to your stupid office picnic
Oh, and when I told you at breakfast we were all out of Rice Krispies
What I meant was, there was only enough left for me, sorry These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
I thought of some more things that should scare you away
These are my confessions
Slipped my mind the last two times, silly me
I guess I gotta give you part three of my confessions Once I blew my nose and then I wiped it on your cat
And I lied, yes, that dress makes you look fat
Anyway, I shouldn't say anymore
'Til I give you part four of my confessions I mean, I'm just getting started here
I'm not even halfway down the list
This thing could go on for Hey hey, where you goin'?
Honey?
What?
Was it something I said?
Women! Are you worried about impending doom?
Those evil villains got ya filled with gloom?

And if the radiation level's okay

Again and again and again Oh, la la la, di de da

Yes, he's wearin' that dumb Power Rangers mask
But he's scarier without it on Sling us a web, you're the Spider-Man

But if there's one thing in this world that I like better
Than a corned beef on rye It's Chicken Pot Pie
Chicken Pot Pie [chorus of chicken-cluck imitations] Gump sat alone on a bench in the park
"My name is Forrest", he'd casually remark
Waitin' for the bus with his hands in his pockets
He just kept sayin' life is like a box of chocolates He's Gump, he's Gump
What's in his head?
He's Gump, he's Gump, he's Gump
Is he in-bred? Gump was a big celebrity
He told JFK that he really had to pee
He never feels too dumb because
His Mom always told him stupid is a stupid does He's Gump, he's Gump
He's kinda square
He's Gump, he's Gump, he's Gump
What's with that hair? Run, run, run, run, now Forrest
Run, run, run like the wind now

His friend with no legs he called Lieutenant Dan
His girlfriend Jenny was kind of a slut
Went to the White House, showed LBJ his butt He's Gump, he's Gump
He's not too bright
He's Gump, he's Gump, he's Gump
But he's alright Is this Gump out of his head?
I think so
Is this Gump really brain dead?
I think so
Did this Gump make lots of bread?
I think so
And that's all I have to say about that Oooh, my little hungry one,
Hungry one.
Open up a package of my bologna.
Oooh, I think the toast is done,

M-M-M-My bologna. Well, I had two weeks of vacation time coming
After working all year down at 'Big Roy's Heating And Plumbing'
So one night when my family and I were gathered 'round the dinner table
I said, "Kids, if you could go anywhere in this great big world now
Where'd you like to go ta?" They said, "Dad, we wanna see the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota"
They picked the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota So the very next day we loaded up the car
With potato skins and pickled wieners
Crossword puzzles, Spider-Man comics
And mama's home made rhubarb pie Pulled out of the driveway and the neighbors
They all waved good-bye and so began our three day journey We picked up a guy holding a sign that said, "Twine ball or bust"
He smelled real bad and he said his name was Bernie
I put in a Slim Whitman tape, my wife put on a brand new hair net
Kids were in the back seat jumping up and down
Yelling, "Are we there yet?" And all of us were joined together in one common thought
As we rolled down the long and winding interstate in our '53 DeSoto We're gonna see the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota
We're headin' for the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota Oh, we couldn't wait to get there
So we drove straight through for three whole days and nights
Of course, we stopped for more pickled wieners now and then The scenery was just so pretty, boy I wish the kids could've seen it
But you can't see out of the side of the car
Because the windows are completely covered
With the decals from all the places where we've already been Like Elvis-O-Rama, the Tupperware Museum
The Boll Weevil Monument and Cranberry World
The Shuffleboard Hall Of Fame, Poodle Dog Rock
And The Mecca of Albino Squirrels We've been to ghost towns, theme parks, wax museums
And the place where you can drive through the middle of a tree
We've seen alligator farms and tarantula ranches
But there's still one thing we gotta see Well, we crossed the state line about 6: 39
And we saw the sign that said, "Twine Ball exit, fifty miles"
Oh, the kids were so happy they started singing
"99 Bottles Of Beer On The Wall" for the twenty-seventh time that day So, we pulled off the road at the last chance gas station
Got a few more pickled wieners and a diet chocolate soda On our way to see the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota
We're gonna see the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota Finally, at 7: 37 early Wednesday evening
As the sun was setting in the Minnesota sky
Out in the distance, on the horizon
It appeared to me like a vision before my unbelieving eyes I parked the car and walked with awe-filled reverence
Toward that glorious, huge, majestic sphere
I was just so overwhelmed by its sheer intensity
I had to pop myself a beer Yes, on these hallowed grounds, open ten to eight on weekdays
In a little shrine under a makeshift pagoda There sits the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota
I tell you, it's the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota Oh, what on earth would make a man decide to do that kind of thing?
Oh, windin' up twenty-one thousand, one hundred forty pounds of string What was he trying to prove? Who was he trying to impress?
Why did he build it? How did he do it? It's anybody's guess
Where did he get the twine? What was goin' through his mind?
Did it just seem like a good idea at the time? Well, we walked up beside it and I warned the kids
"Now, you better not touch it, those ropes are there for a reason"
I said, "Maybe if you're good, I'll tie it to the back of our car
And we can take it home", but I was only teasin' Then we went to the gift shop and stood in line
Bought a souvenir miniature ball of twine
Some window decals and anything else they'd sell us
And I bought a couple postcards
"Greetings from the twine ball, wish you were here"
Won't the folks back home be jealous? I gave our camera to Bernie and we stood by the ball
And we all gathered 'round and said, "Cheese"
The Bernie ran away with my brand new Instamatic
But at least we got our memories So we all just stared at the ball for a while
And my eyes got moist but I said with a smile
"Kids, this here's what America's all about"
Then I started feelin' kinda gooey inside
And I fell on my knees and I cried and cried
And that's when those security guards threw us out You know, I bet if we unraveled that sucker
It'd roll all the way down to Fargo, North Dakota 'Cause it's the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota
I'm talkin' 'bout the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota Well, we stayed that night at the Twine Ball Inn
In the morning we were on our way home again
But we really didn't want to leave, that was perfectly clear I said, "Folks, I can tell you're all sad to go"
Then I winked my eye and I said
"You know, I got a funny kind of feelin'
We'll be comin' back again next year" 'Cause I've been all around this great big world
And I can't think of anywhere else I'd rather go ta Than the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota
I said the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota Minnesota, Minnesota, Minnesota Sometimes I feel, like I need a vacation
Sometimes I feel, like I wanna go
To the city of cavemen, the city of Bedrock

Oh, no no no! Don't Dino, don't!
Now take it easy, boy!} Lucky me, workin' down in the gravel pit
Movin' rocks, on a big dinosaur I sit
Mr. Slate gets mad and he throws a fit
Pull the birdie's tail, everybody knows it's time to quit I realize I'm living in the Stone Age
No fax, no cellular phone-age
Pick my teeth with a dinosaur bone-age
Liftin' heavy boulders every day for my wage Barney Rubble, laughin' like a hyena

Oh, boy!} Once in a while maybe you will feel the urge
To break international copyright law
By downloading MP3s from file-sharing sites
Like Morpheus or Grokster or LimeWire or KaZaA
But deep in your heart you know the guilt would drive you mad
And the shame would leave a permanent scar
'Cause you start out stealing songs, and then you're robbing liquor stores
And selling crack and running over school kids with your car So don't download this song
The record store's where you belong
Go and buy the CD like you know that you should
Oh don't download this song Oh you don't want to mess with the R I double A
They'll sue you if you burn that CD-R
It doesn't matter if you're a grandma or a 7-year-old girl
They'll treat you like the evil, hard-bitten criminal scum you are So don't download this song
Don't go pirating music all day long
Go and buy the CD like you know that you should
Oh, don't download this song Don't take away money from artists just like me
How else can I afford another solid gold Humvee?
And diamond-studded swimming pools, these things don't grow on trees
So all I ask is everybody, please... Don't download this song (Don't do it, no, no)
Even Lars Ulrich knows it's wrong (You can just ask him)
Go and buy the CD like you know that you should (You really should)
Oh, don't download this song...
Don't download this song (Oh please don't you do it)
Or you might wind up in jail like Tommy Chong (Remember Tommy)
Go and buy the CD (Right Now) like you know that you should (Go out and buy it)
Oh don't download this song...
Don't download this song (No no no no no no)
Or you'll burn in Hell before too long (And you'd deserve it)
Go and buy the CD (Just buy it) like you know that you should (Ya cheap bastard)
Oh, don't download this song Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you Well, it's time to celebrate your birthday, it happens every year
We'll eat a lot of broccoli and drink a lot of beer
You should be good and happy that there's something you can eat
A million people every day are starving in the street Your daddy's in the gutter with the wretched and the poor
Your mama's in the kitchen with a can of Cycle Four
There's garbage in the water, there's poison in the sky
I guess it won't be long before we're all gonna die Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you Well, what's the matter, little friend, you think this party is the pits
Enjoy it while you can, we'll soon be blown to bits
The monkeys in the pentagon are gonna cook our goose
Their finger's on the button, all they need is an excuse It doesn't take a military genius to see
We'll all be crispy critters after World War III
There's nowhere you can run to, nowhere you can hide
When they drop the big one, we all get fried Come on boys and girls, sing along, okay Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you, wow Well, there's a punk in the alley and he's looking for a fight
There's an Arab on the corner buying everything in sight
There's a mother in the ghetto with another mouth to feed
Seems that everywhere you look today there's misery and greed I guess you know the earth is gonna crash into the sun
But that's no reason why we shouldn't have a little fun
So if you think it's scary, if it's more than you can take
Just blow out the candles and have a piece of cake Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you, wow Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you
And a pinch to grow an inch Avocado,
What makes you think you're so holy?
You're gonna be guacamole before too long. Oh, you're a green one,
You know that you're out of season. You'd better let somebody eat you,
Let somebody eat you.
Ya better let somebody eat you
Before it's too late. My life is brilliant
What? Was I too early?
Sorry. You wanna start over?
Keep Going? Ok. Now? Now? My life is brilliant
Your life's a joke
You're just pathetic
You're always broke
Your homemade Star Trek Uniform
Really ain't impressin me
You're sufferin from delusions of adequacy You're pitiful
You're pitiful
You're pitiful it's true
Never had a date that you couldn't inflate
And you smell repulsive, too
What a bummer being you Well you just can't dance
And forget romance Everybody you know still calls you "Farty Pants"
But you always have a job
Well I mean
As long as you still can work that Slurpee machine You're pitiful
You're pitiful
You're pitiful it's true
You're half undressed
Eating chips off your chest
While you're playin Halo 2
No ones classier than you La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la Loser! You're pitiful
You're pitiful
You're pitiful it's true
You're dog would much rather play fetch by itself
You still live with your mom and you're 42
Guess you'll never grow a clue
Well it just sucks to be you You're sort of famous
A minor celebrity
And so it only makes sense
The world would be
Obsessed with every
Single thing you do They're running 'round
With their camcorders in the night
They lurk impatiently
In hope that they just might
See something real embarrassing
You do The bad hair day and sweat-stained t-shirt
That's the story that
They're gonna feature
With exclusive pics
Of your flabby behind
You think you're all alone
But that's right when you'll find A bunch of paparazzi
Popping out of nowhere
Cameras in your face
And then suddenly
You're on TMZ
You're on TMZ Following you
When you're walking down the street
And asking stupid questions
While you're trying to eat
So you cover your face
Thinking to yourself
"Hey, isn't this creepy?" And they're out there praying
You'll have a big meltdown
And take 'em on a little car chase
Through this whole town
They'll be there with you
When you're going to jail
First on the scene
For every wardrobe fail You just picked up some transvestite
Seconds later
It's up on the website
Get a vegas wedding A quickie divorce
And they'll be
Sneaking in
Snapping pictures, of course And if they ever catch you
Picking your nose
Or stumbling down the street
On a drunken spree
You're on TMZ Stalking you, just waiting by your front door
Trailing you through
Airport security
They're with TMZ They're with TMZ [We caught this oscar nominee picking up DOG POOP
Is that a baby bump?
I pronounce her guilty, of leaving the house while FAT
Look who's drinking COFFEE,
Everything celebrities do is FASCINATING] Oh, let me tell you
It's getting to the point
Where a famous person can't
Even get a D.U.I
Or go on a racist rant
Those guys are all around
So you really shouldn't dare
Go to every club in town
If you've lost your underwear Seems that every single time
A star decides to shave her head
Or ram their car into a tree
They're on TMZ If they catch you peeing in the bushes
Later on, that night
Well, I guarantee
You're on TMZ
You're on TMZ You're on TMZ Every single celebrity
Knows they're gonna be There on TMZ Well, I bought it up.
Brought windows home,
and tried to boot it up.
But when I load it up,
It says my memory is not enough...
I'd be runnin' out.
I need some extra RAM to fix me up...
I have to cough it up...
Open my wallet up.
It never stops. (4x)
This Windows 95!
It suckin' up my Drive.
It' makes a pentium fly.
But my PC... is obsolete.
I'll have to buy myself a brand new machine...
Bring it up...
Shake me up.
You suck me in, and then you got me hooked.
You got me..., you got me.
There's so much stuff to buy
I need a new harddrive
It's gonna suck me dry.
My three eight six don't have the speed,
it takes an hour just to bring up the screen
nanana,
Oh no.
I making software buys,
Wow!
It's making Bill Gates come.
Yoyo.
You make a rich man come. Isn't it strange?
Feels like I'm lookin' in the mirror
What would people say?
If only they knew that I was Part of some geneticist's plan
Born to be a carbon copy man
There in a petri dish, late one night
They took a donor's body cell and fertilized a human egg and so I say I think I'm a clone now
There's always two of me just a-hangin' around
I think I'm a clone now
'Cause every chromosome is a hand-me-down Look at the way
We go out walking close together
I guess you could say
I'm really beside myself I still remember how it began
They produced a carbon copy man
Born in a science lab late one night
Without a mother or a father, just a test tube and a womb with a view I think I'm a clone now
There's always two of me just a-hangin' around
I think I'm a clone now
'Cause every chromosome is a hand-me-down I think I'm a clone now
And I can stay at home while I'm out of town
I think I'm a clone now
'Cause every pair of genes is a hand-me-down Signing autographs for my fans
Come and meet the carbon copy man
Livin' in stereo, it's all right
Well I can be my own best friend and I can send myself for pizza so I say I think I'm a clone now
Another one of me's always hangin' around
I think I'm a clone now
'Cause every chromosome is a hand-me-down I think I'm a clone now
I've been on Oprah Winfrey, I'm world renowned
I think I'm a clone now
And every pair of genes is a hand-me-down I think I'm a clone now
That's my genetic twin always hangin' around
I think I'm a clone now
'Cause every chromosome is a hand-me-down
I think I'm a clone now Some girls like to buy new shoes
And others like drivin' trucks and wearing tattoos
There's only one thing that they all like a bunch
Oh, girls, they wanna have lunch
Oh, girls just wanna have lunch I know how to keep a woman satisfied
When I whip out my Diner's Card their eyes get so wide
They're always in the mood for something to munch
Oh, girls, they wanna have lunch
Oh, girls just wanna have That's all they really want, some lunch
Don't ask 'em to dinner or breakfast or brunch
'Cause girls, they wanna have lunch
Oh, girls just wanna have lunch Girls, they watch, wanna to have lunch
Girls, wanna have She eats like she got a hole in her neck
And I'm the one that always gets stuck with the check
Can't figure out how come they don't weigh a ton
Oh, girls, they wanna have lunch
Oh, girls just wanna have That's all they really want, is some lunch
Don't know for certain but I've got a hunch
Those girls, they wanna have lunch

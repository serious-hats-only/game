Photosynthesis Photosynthesis does not involve a camera

Photosynthesis is how plants take in light
From the sun and turn it into energy
It's actually a thing on which most life depends
Here on the planet Earth Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis With plants Chlorophyll cells take in carbon dioxide
Now that's the air that we breathe out
Combines it with water and exposes it to sunlight
And that's how plants can make their own food
Photosynthesis is why plants need light
And photosynthesis is why humans need plants
Because through photosynthesis plants make oxygen
And humans need oxygen to breathe Photosynthesis

To the name of this town in a desktop globe
Exit wound in a foreign nation
Showing the home of the one, this was written for My apartment looks upside down from there
Water spirals the wrong way out the sink
And her voice is a backwards record
It's like a whirlpool and it never ends Ana Ng and I are getting old
And we still haven't walked
In the glow of each other's majestic presence Listen Ana, hear my words
They're the ones you would think
I would say, "If there was a me for you" All alone at the '64 World's Fair
Eighty dolls yelling, "Small girl after all"
Who was at the Dupont Pavilion?
Why was the bench still warm? Who had been there? Or the time when the storm tangled up the wire
To the horn on the pole at the bus depot
And in back of the edge of hearing
These are the words that the voice was repeating Ana Ng and I are getting old
And we still haven't walked
In the glow of each other's majestic presence Listen Ana, hear my words
They're the ones you would think I would say
"If there was a me for you" When I was driving once
I saw this painted on a bridge
"I don't want the world, I just want your half" They don't need me here and I know you're there
Where the world goes by like the humid air
And it sticks like a broken record Everything sticks like a broken record
Everything sticks until it goes away
And the truth is, we don't know anything Ana Ng and I are getting old
And we still haven't walked
In the glow of each other's majestic presence Listen Ana, hear my words
They're the ones you would think I would say
"If there was a me for you" Ana Ng and I are getting old
And we still haven't walked
In the glow of each other's majestic presence Listen Ana, hear my words
They're the ones you would think I would say
"If there was a me for you" Ana Ng and I are getting old
And we still haven't walked
In the glow of each other's majestic presence Listen Ana, hear my words
They're the ones you would think I would say
"If there was a me for you" Ana Ng and I are getting old
And we still haven't walked
In the glow of each other's majestic presence Listen Ana, hear my words
They're the ones you would think I would say
"If there was a me for you" There's a great big beautiful tomorrow
Shining at the end of every day
There's a great big beautiful tomorrow
And tomorrow's just a dream away Man has a dream and that's the start
He follows his dream with mind and heart
And when it becomes a reality
It's a dream come true for you and me So there's a great big beautiful tomorrow
Shining at the end of every day
There's a great big beautiful tomorrow

I think I'm getting good, but I can handle criticism
I'll show you what I know
And you can tell me if you think I'm getting better on the drums
I'll leave the front unlocked
'Cause I can't hear the doorbell When I get into it, I can't tell if you are watching me twirling the stick
When I give the signal, my friend Rabbi Vole will play the solo Someday, somebody else besides me
Will call me by my stage name
They will call me Dr. Worm

Could believe for all the world
That you are my precious little girl
But don't, don't, don't let's start
I've got a weak heart
And I don't get around how you get around When you are alone, you are the cat, you are the phone, you are an animal
The words I'm singing now mean nothing more than 'meow' to an animal
Wake up, smell the cat food in your bank account

And I don't get around how you get around No one in the world ever gets what they want, and that is beautiful
Everybody dies frustrated and sad, and that is beautiful
They want what they're not and I wish they would stop singing

And the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Lazy Head and Sleepy Bones
Always disagree
Though everybody says they should be friends
They're too tired to see When Sleepy Bones says he's feeling tired
Lazy Head wants to rest
When Lazy Head says it's "number one"
Sleepy Bones says it's "best" When Lazy Head uses imagination
Sleepy Bones daydreams
Sleepy Bones says, "It's not what it looks like"
And Lazy Head says, "It's not what it seems" Lazy Head and Sleepy Bones
Always disagree
Though everybody says they should be friends
They're too tired to see When Lazy Head says somebody's "skinny"
Sleepy Bones says "thin"
When Sleepy Bones says "identical"
Lazy Head says "twin" When Lazy Head says the window is "closed"
Sleepy Bones says it's "shut"
When Sleepy Bones says that something "isn't"
Lazy Head says, "It's not" Lazy Head and Sleepy Bones
Both take naps so long
And even though they should be friends
They can't get along Lazy Head and Sleepy Bones
Always disagree
Though everybody says they should be friends
They're too tired to see In 1844, the Democrats were split
The three nominees for the presidential candidate
Were Martin Van Buren, a former president and an abolitionist
James Buchanan, a moderate
Louis Cass, a general and expansionist
From Nashville came a dark horse riding up
He was James K. Polk, Napoleon of the Stump Austere, severe, he held few people dear
His oratory filled his foes with fear
The factions soon agreed
He's just the man we need
To bring about victory
Fulfill our manifest destiny
And annex the land the Mexicans command
And when the votes were cast the winner was
Mister James K. Polk, Napoleon of the Stump In four short years he met his every goal
He seized the whole southwest from Mexico
Made sure the tarriffs fell
And made the English sell the Oregon territory
He built an independent treasury
Having done all this he sought no second term
But precious few have mourned the passing of
Mister James K. Polk, our eleventh president
Young Hickory, Napoleon of the Stump I've been leaving on my things

A gigantic nuclear furnace
Where hydrogen is built into helium
At a temperature of millions of degrees Yo ho, it's hot, the sun is not
A place where we could live
But here on Earth there'd be no life
Without the light it gives We need its light
We need its heat
We need its energy
Without the sun, without a doubt
There'd be no you and me The sun is a mass of incandescent gas
A gigantic nuclear furnace
Where hydrogen is built into helium
At a temperature of millions of degrees The sun is hot It is so hot that everything on it is a gas: iron, copper,
aluminum, and many others. The sun is large If the sun were hollow, a million Earths could fit inside.
And yet, the sun is only a middle-sized star. The sun is far away About 93 million miles away, and that's why it looks so small. And even when it's out of sight
The sun shines night and day The sun gives heat
The sun gives light
The sunlight that we see
The sunlight comes from our own sun's
Atomic energy Scientists have found that the sun is a huge atom-smashing machine.
The heat and light of the sun come from the nuclear reactions of hydrogen,
carbon, nitrogen, and helium. The sun is a mass of incandescent gas
A gigantic nuclear furnace
Where hydrogen is built into helium

Make a little birdhouse in your soul A woman came up to me and said, "I'd like to poison your mind
With wrong ideas that appeal to you, though I am not unkind"
She looked at me, I looked at something written across her scalp,
And these are the words that it faintly said as I tried to call for help There's only one thing that I know how to do well
And I've often been told that you only can do what you know how to do well
And that's be you, be what you're like, be like yourself
And so I'm having a wonderful time, but I'd rather be whistling in the dark
Whistling in the dark, whistling in the dark, whistling in the dark
Whistling in the dark, whistling in the dark
There's only one thing that I like, and that is whistling in the dark Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah A man came up to me and said, "I'd like to change your mind
By hitting it with a rock," he said, "though I am not unkind"
We laughed at his little joke, and then I happily walked away
And hit my head on the wall of the jail where the two of us live today There's only one thing that I know how to do well
And I've often been told that you only can do what you know how to do well
And that's be you, be what you're like, be like yourself
And so I'm having a wonderful time, but I'd rather be whistling in the dark
Whistling in the dark, whistling in the dark, whistling in the dark
Whistling in the dark, whistling in the dark
There's only one thing that I like, and that is whistling in the dark There's only one thing that I know how to do well
And I've often been told that you only can do what you know how to do well
And that's be you, be what you're like, be like yourself
And so I'm having a wonderful time, but I'd rather be whistling in the dark
Whistling in the dark, whistling in the dark, whistling in the dark
Whistling in the dark, whistling in the dark
Whistling, whistling, whistling in the dark Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah Whistling, whistling, whistling, whistling
Dark, dark, dark, dark
Whistling, whistling, whistling, whistling
Dark, dark, dark, dark
Whistling, whistling, whistling, whistling
Dark, dark, dark, dark
Whistling, whistling, whistling, whistling
Dark, dark, dark, dark
Whistling, whistling, whistling, whistling

Come inside, it's fun inside It's the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse roll call! Donald!
Donald: Present. Daisy!
Daisy: Here. Goofy!
Goofy: Hyuck, here. Pluto!
Pluto: Ruff ruff ruff Minnie!
Minnie: Hi, here!

Mickey: Right here. It's the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse
Come inside, it's fun inside M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E Year after year,
though every dream of a pony would end in tears,
the cake was lit and as you blew the candles out,
your heart refilled,
and every year,
your dream was killed.
It may take an ocean of whiskey and time to wash all the letdown out of your mind,
and this may not be the thing you requested,
but I am the answer to all your prayers. This is where the party ends
i can't stand here listening to you
and your racist friend
i know politics bore you
but i feel like a hypocrite talking to you
and your racist friend
It was the loveliest party that i've ever attended
if anything was broken i'm sure it could be mended
my head can't tolerate this bobbing and pretending
listen to some bullet-head and the madness that he's saying
This is where the party ends
i'll just sit here wondering how you
can stand by your racist friend
i know politics bore you
but i feel like a hypocrite talking to you
you and your racist friend
This is where the party ends
i can't stand here listening to you
and your racist friend
i know politics bore you
but i feel like a hypocrite talking to you
and your racist friend
Out from the kitchen to the bedroom to the hallway
your friend apologizes, he could see it my way
he let the contents of the bottle do the thinking
can't shake the devil's hand and say you're only kidding
This is where the party ends
i can't stand here listening to you
and your racist friend
i know politics bore you
but i feel like a hypocrite talking to you
and your racist friend

this is Science is real
From the Big Bang to DNA
Science is real
From evolution to the Milky Way
I like the stories
About angels, unicorns and elves
Now I like those stories
As much as anybody else
But when I'm seeking knowledge
Either simple or abstract
The facts are with science
The facts are with science Science is real
Science is real
Science is real Science is real
From anatomy to geology
Science is real
From astrophysics to biology
A scientific theory
Isn't just a hunch or guess
It's more like a question
That's been put through a lot of tests
And when a theory emerges
Consistent with the facts
The proof is with science
The truth is with science Science is real
Science is real
Science is real Science is real I saw the best minds of my generation
Destroyed by madness, starving, hysterical
I should be allowed to glue my poster
I should be allowed to think I should be allowed to glue my poster
I should be allowed to think
I should be allowed to think
I should be allowed to think
And I should be allowed to blurt the merest idea
If, by random whim, one occurs to me
If necessary, leave paper stains on the gray utility pole I saw the worst bands of my generation
Applied by Magic Marker to drywall
I should be allowed to shoot my mouth off
I should have a call-in show I should be allowed to glue my poster
I should be allowed to think
I should be allowed to think
I should be allowed to think
And I should be allowed to blurt the merest idea
If, by random whim, one occurs to me
If necessary, leave paper stains on the gray utility pole I am not allowed
To ever come up with a single original thought
I am not allowed
To meet the criminal government agent who oppresses me I was the worst hope of my generation
Destroyed by madness, starving, hysterical
I should be allowed to share my feelings
I should be allowed to feel I should be allowed to glue my poster
I should be allowed to think
I should be allowed to think
I should be allowed to think
And I should be allowed to blurt the merest idea
If, by random whim, one occurs to me
But, sadly, this can never be I am not allowed to think

I am not allowed to think (I am not allowed to think)
I am not allowed to think (I am not allowed to think)

And we're on a runway
Ready to take off
And then we're in the air Motion, direction, acceleration
Motion, direction, acceleration I've got speed (that's how fast I am moving)
I've got velocity (that's my speed and direction) When I'm on my Big Wheel

And once in a while I feel like being dry
But we're doomed and we're drowned by this feeling we surround
So I hope that I get old before I die Ohhhhh
It's a long, long rope they use to hang you soon I hope
And I wonder why this hasn't happened
Why why why
And I think about the dirt that I'll be wearing for a shirt
And I hope that I get old before I die Clear off the kitchen table darling
For on the kitchen table I must lie
I'm just tired for my wife just served the banquet of my life
And I hope that I get old before I die Ohhhhh
It's a long, long rope they use to hang you soon I hope
And I wonder why this hasn't happened

Made of a raincoat
But when you think of that
You hurt your mind
And you'll need a friend
To talk you down Needing a friend to talk you down
Is food that comes from a pipe
But when you hate the food
That comes from a pipe
You will turn to drugs
To help you sleep Turning to drugs to help you sleep
Will only lead to sleep
And sleeping is a gateway drug
To being awake, being awake, being awake again Being awake is swimming around in a lake
Of the undead
And the undead are like
A bunch of friends
That demand constant attention Demanding constant attention
Will only lead to attention
And once they have your attention
They use it to ask for attention
And once they have that attention
They use it to ask for attention Wearing a raincoat is flying around in a yellow rubber airplane
Made out of a raincoat, yes but when you think of that
You hurt your mind
And you'll need your mind
For later on Needing a mind for later on
Is a friend that comes at a price
But when you hate the friend
That comes at a price
You will play the drums

Who hit me in the eye? Please pass the milk, please
Please pass the milk, please
Please pass the milk, please Leave me alone, leave me alone Who's knocking on the wall? All alone, all alone
All by myself What's that blue thing doing here? Something grabbed ahold of my hand
I didn't know what had my hand
But that's when all my troubles began I don't understand you
(I don't understand you)
I just don't understand you
(I don't understand you)
I don't understand the things you say
I can't understand a single word I don't understand you

And I walk along darkened corridors I know you deceived me, couldn't sleep last night
Now my tear stains on the wall reflect an ugly sight
I can see your secrets
No need to confess
Everyone looks naked when you know the world's address The world's address
A place that's worn
A sad pun that reflects a sadder mess
I'll repeat it for those who may not have already guessed
The world's address Life's parade of fashion just leaves me depressed
Under every garment I can see the world's address
Call the men of science and let them hear this song
Tell them Albert Einstein and Copernicus were wrong The world's address
A place that's worn
A sad pun that reflects a sadder mess
I'll repeat it for those who may not have already guessed
The world's address Call the men of science and let them hear this song
Tell them Albert Einstein and Copernicus were wrong The world's address
A place that's worn
A sad pun that reflects a sadder mess
I'll repeat it for those who may not have already guessed The world's address
A place that's worn
A sad pun that reflects a sadder mess
I'll say it one more time for those who may not have already guessed
The world's address If there's a question bothering your brain
That you think you know how to explain
You need a test
Yeah, think up a test If it's possible to prove it wrong
You're going to want to know before too long
You'll need a test If somebody says they figured it out
And they're leaving any room for doubt
Come up with a test
Yeah, you need a test Are you sure that that thing is true?
Or did someone just tell it to you?
Come up with a test Test it out
Find a way to show what would happen
If you were incorrect
(Test it out)
A fact is just a fantasy
Unless it can be checked
Make a test
Test it out If you want to know if it's the truth
Then, my friend, you are going to need proof
Come up with a test
Yeah, you need a test Don't believe it 'cause they say it's so
If it's not true, you have a right to know
Put it to the test (put it to the test)
Yeah, test it out (put it to the test)
Yeah, put it to the test (put it to the test)
Put it to the test (put it to the test) I'm going down to Cowtown
The cow's a friend to me
Lives beneath the ocean and that's where I will be
Beneath the waves, the waves
And that's where I will be
I'm gonna see the cow beneath the sea The yellow Roosevelt Avenue leaf overturned
The ardor of arboreality is an adventure we have spurned, we've spurned
A new leaf overturned
It's a new leaf overturned And so I'm going down to Cowtown
The cow's a friend to me
Lives beneath the ocean and that's where I will be
Beneath the waves, the waves
And that's where I will be
I'm gonna see the cow beneath the sea We yearn to swim for home, but our only home is bone
How sleepless is the egg knowing that which throws the stone
Foresees the bone, the bone
Our only home is bone
Our only home is bone And so I'm going down to Cowtown
The cow's a friend to me
Lives beneath the ocean and that's where I will be
Beneath the waves, the waves
And that's where I will be
I'm gonna see the cow beneath the sea Yes I'm going down to Cowtown
The cow's a friend to me
Lives beneath the ocean and that's where I will be
Beneath the waves, the waves

Tell him not to come back again?
Girl! Why not give him the slip?

It's prominently disco.
Everyone is dressed so oddly I can't recognize them,
I can't tell the staff from the customers. Baby check this out I've got something to say,
Man it's so loud in here.
When they stop the drum machine and I can think again,
I'll remember what it was. You have to carry all your things,
You can't misplace them,
There's nowhere to place anything. Baby check this out I've got something to say,
Man it's so loud in here.
When they stop the drum machine and I can think again,
I'll remember what it was. They're all shoutin something at us, waving and pointing.
They revamped the airport completely now it looks just like a nightclub,
Everyone's excited and confused. Baby check this out I've got something to say,
Man it's so loud in here.
When they start the laugh machine and I can laugh again,
I'll remember what it was. Baby check this out I've got something to say,
Man it's so loud in here
(Man it's loud in here)
repeat 5x I met someone at the dog show
She was holding my left arm
But everyone was acting normal, so I tried to look nonchalant
We both said, "I really love you"
The Shriners loaned us cars
We raced up and down the sidewalk twenty thousand million times Why did they send her over anyone else?
How should I react?
These things happen to other people
They don't happen at all, in fact When you're following an angel
Does it mean you have to throw your body off a building?
Somewhere they're meeting on a pinhead
Calling you an angel, calling you the nicest things
I heard they had a space program
When they sing you can't hear, there's no air
Sometimes I think I kind of like that
And other times I think I'm already there Gonna ask for my admission
Gonna speak to the man in charge
The secretary says he's on another line
Can I hold for a long, long time?
I found out she's an angel
I don't think she knows I know
I'm worried that something might happen to me
If anyone ever finds out Why, why did they send her over anyone else?
How should I react?
These things happen to other people
They don't happen at all When you're following an angel
Does it mean you have to throw your body off a building?
Somewhere they're meeting on a pinhead
Calling you an angel, calling you the nicest things
I heard they had a space program
When they sing you can't hear, there's no air
Sometimes I think I kind of like that
And other times I think I am already there When you're following an angel
Does it mean you have to throw your body off a building?
Somewhere they're meeting on a pinhead
Calling you an angel, calling you the nicest things I remember the year I went to camp
I heard about some lady named Selma and some blacks
Somebody put their fingers in the President's ears
It wasn't too much later they came out with Johnson's wax
I remember the book depository where they crowned the king of Cuba
Now that's all I can think of, but I'm sure there's something else
Way down inside me I can feel it coming back Purple toupee will show the way when summer brings you down
(Purple toupee when summer brings you down)
Purple toupee and gold lame will turn your brain around
(Purple toupee and gold lame) Chinese people were fighting in the park
We tried to help them fight, no one appreciated that
Martin X was mad when they outlawed bell bottoms
Ten years later they were sharing the same cell
I shouted out, "Free the Expo '67"
Till they stepped on my hair, and they told me I was fat
Now I'm very big, I'm a big important man
And the only thing that's different is underneath my hat Purple toupee will show the way when summer brings you down
(Purple toupee when summer brings you down)
Purple toupee and gold lame will turn your brain around
(Purple toupee and gold lame) Purple toupee is here to stay after the hair has gone away
The purple brigade is marching from the grave We're on some kind of mission
We have an obligation
We have to wear toupees Notes
Following are the lyrics to the Dial-a-Song demo: Now that's all I can think of, but I'm sure there's something else
Way down inside me I can feel it coming back Purple toupee will show the way when summer brings us down
(Purple toupee will show the way)
Purple toupee and gold lame will turn your brains around
(Purple toupee and gold lame) Down on the ground is where I found a popular revolution
Purple's the shade that brightens in the grave I was down, but now I'm feeling proud
They stepped on my face, they told me I was fat
Now I'm flying planes, I'm a big important man
And the only thing that's different is underneath my hat Purple toupee will show the way when summer brings us down
(Purple toupee will show the way)
Purple toupee and gold lame will turn your brains around
(Purple toupee and gold lame) Purple toupee is here to stay after the real thing's gone
This is the kind that never fades away
Purple toupee Purple toupee Exquisite dead guy
Rotating in his display case
Exquisite dead guy
Swear I saw his mouth move Exquisite dead guy
Outside my high rise apartment
Exquisite dead guy
Hanging from a skyhook How am I supposed to let you know the way I feel
About you How am I supposed to let you know the way I feel
About you Lie still, little bottle, and shake my shaky hand
Black coffee's not enough for me, I need a better friend
One pill at the bottom is singing my favorite song
I know I must investigate
I hope that I can sing along There's no time for metaphors cried the little pill to me
He said, "Life is a placebo masquerading as a simile"*
Well, I knew that pill was lying
Too gregarious, too nice
But as he walked I had to sing this twice Lie still, little bottle
Don't twist, it ain't twistin' time
With every move you make you just disintegrate my ever-troubled mind Lie still, little bottle, and shake my shaky hand
Black coffee's not enough for me, I need a better friend
One pill at the bottom is singing my favorite song
I know I must investigate
I hope that I can sing along Lie still, little bottle
Lie still
Lie still, little bottle
Lie still
Lie still
Lie still instrumental The sun is a miasma
Of incandescent plasma
The sun's not simply made out of gas
No, no, no The sun is a quagmire
It's not made of fire
Forget what you've been told in the past (Plasma!)
Electrons are free
(Plasma!)
A fourth state of matter
Not gas, not liquid, not solid The sun is no red dwarf
I hope it never morphs
Into some supernova'd collapsed orb
Orb, orb, orb The sun is a miasma
Of incandescent plasma
I forget what I was told by myself
Elf, elf, elf (Plasma!)
Electrons are free
(Plasma!)
A fourth state of matter
Not gas, not liquid, not solid (Plasma!)
Forget that song
(Plasma!)
They got it wrong
That thesis has been rendered invalid I could never sleep my way to the top
'Cause my alarm clock always wakes me right up
And since my options had been whittled away
I struck a bargain with my radio DJ
I said I'd like this song to be number one
He said, "I'd really, really love to help you, my son"
And then I knew that I would have him to thank
Because he asked me how much I had in the bank He said to think long-term investment
And that all the others had forgiven themselves
He said the net reward would justify
The colossal mess they'd made of their lives He said the record wouldn't have to be hot
And no one ever seemed to care if it's not
It would depend on something else that I've got
And that the other ones who'd given it a shot
Had seen a modest sum grow geometrically
And then they had forgiven themselves
Because the net reward had justified
The colossal mess they'd made of their lives Hey, Mr. DJ, I thought you said we had a deal
I thought you said, "You scratch my back, and I'll scratch your record"
And I thought you said we had a deal Well, I told you about the world, its address
I wonder when they're gonna clean up the mess
You know, the rabid child is still tuning in
Chess Piece Face's patience must be wearing thin
Because they haven't played this song on the air
Not that anyone but me even cared
And the disc jockey has moved out of town
The district coroner says he's nowhere to be found He said to think long-term investment
And that all the others had forgiven themselves
He said the net reward would justify
The colossal mess they'd made of their lives Hey, Mr. DJ, I thought you said we had a deal
I thought you said, "You scratch my back, and I'll scratch your record"
And I thought you said we had a deal The sun is mass of incandescent gas
A gigantic nuclear furnace
Where hydrogen is built into helium
At a temperature of millions of degrees
Yo-ho, it's hot
The sun is not a place where we could live
But here on earth
There'd be no life without the light it gives
We need its light
We need its heat, we need its energy
Without the sun
Without a doubt there'd be no you and me
The sun is mass of incandescent gas
A gigantic nuclear furnace
Where hydrogen is built into helium
At a temperature of millions of degrees
The sun is hot
The sun is so hot that everything on it is a gas
Copper, iron, aluminum
And the surface of the sun are all gas
The sun is large
If the sun is so large a million earths could fit inside
And yet the sun's just a middle-sized star
The sun is far away
It's about ninety three million miles away
And that's why it looks so small
But even when its out of sight
It shines both night and day
The sun gives light, the sun gives heat
The sunlight that we see
The sunlight comes from our own sun's
Atomic energy
Scientists have found that the sun
Is a huge atom-crushing machine
The heat and light of the sun
Are caused by the nuclear reactions
Between Hydrogen, Carbon, Nitrogen and Helium
The sun is mass of incandescent gas
A gigantic nuclear furnace
Where hydrogen is built into helium
At a temperature of millions of degrees Tesla
Brought the X-ray photo to the world
Brought the AC power to the world Here is a mind
That can see across space
Here is a mind soaring free
Sound turns to light
And light turns to waves
And waves turn to all things perceived Maybe that knowledge would drive one insane
How can that knowledge be tamed? Tesla
Ushered the radio wave into the world
Ushered the neon light
Into the world The Hotel New Yorker
He's dead on the floor
The body of Nikola lies
With just his papers
No family to tell
Out of the windows birds fly Under an X-ray of Mark Twain's skull
The plan for the death-ray's design Tesla
Brought the radar detection to the world
Ushered remote control
Into the world
Ushered the bladeless turbine
Into the world
Ushered the neon light

Plenty of time to turn mistakes into rhyme
There's a place for those who love their poetry
It's just across from the sign that says "Pros Only" So if you like a band with a chick singer
Say your cup of tea is a wall of trombones
If you dig Menudo or MDC we salute you the way we know

There must be hundreds that look at you as if you're some kind of

I'll tell you why Hats off to the New Age hairstyle made of bones
Hats off to the use of hats as megaphones

And here's the reason why, why, why I love diggin' in the dirt
With just a pick and brush
Finding fossils is my aim
So I'm never in a rush
'Cause the treasures that I seek
Are rare and ancient things
Like Velociraptor's jaw
Or Archaeopteryx's wings Now all the kids
Who wanna see 'em
Are lining up
At our museum I am a paleontologist
That's who I am, that's who I am, that's who I am
I am a paleontologist
That's who I am, that's who I am, that's who I am Could it be an herbivore
Crushing plants with rounded teeth
Or ferocious carnivore
Who moves so quickly on its feet?
It's like pieces of a puzzle
That I love to try and solve
It's so fun to think about
How a species has evolved And all the kids
Who wanna see 'em
Can check 'em out
At our museum I am a paleontologist
That's who I am, that's who I am, that's who I am
I am a paleontologist
That's who I am, that's who I am, that's who I am Is it a T-rex? (I keep digging, digging, digging, digging)
(Digging, digging, digging, digging)
Maybe a Triceratops? (Digging, digging, digging, digging)
(Digging, digging, digging, digging)
Or a Carnotaur? (Digging, digging, digging, digging)
(Digging, digging, digging, digging)
(Digging, digging, digging, digging, diggin')
Pachycephalosaurus? I am a paleontologist
That's who I am, that's who I am, that's who I am

That's who I am, that's who I am, that's who I am
That's who I am, that's who I am, that's who I am Get out of the car, put down the phone
Take off that stupid-looking hat you wear
I'm gonna die if you touch me one more time
Well, I guess that I'm gonna die no matter what Love people are there, the smell is love is everywhere
You think it's always sensitive and good
You think that I want to be understood
I've got a match, your embrace and my collapse Beat up the cat if you need someone else on the mat
I put a rock in the coffee in your coffee mug
Which one of us is the one that we can't trust?
You say that I think it's you, but I don't agree with that Love people are there, the smell is love is everywhere
You think it's always sensitive and good
You think that I want to be understood
I've got a match, your embrace and my collapse Even when we get along
I've got a match, your embrace and my collapse Love people are there, the smell is love is everywhere
Why can't you be sensitive and good?
Why don't you want to be understood?
I've got a match, your embrace and my collapse I've got a match, your embrace and my collapse Life is made out of cells
Cells make copies of themselves (copies of themselves)
And they make copies of themselves (and they make copies of themselves)
And they make copies of themselves Different cells have different jobs
But they all have one thing in common
Inside of every cell is a twisted ladder
A recipe for life called DNA
The directions are written out in the ladder's rungs
Where they can be found
In every cell of everything that lives A cell knows what it has to do
To grow into some moss or a shrew
Algae or a kangaroo
Bug or a sunflower
Dwight David Eisenhower
A frog, a fish or you
Cells are small, too small to see
But together they can make a tree Within the cell there's a tiny spiral staircase
That tells the cell just how it's going to grow
The instructions are spelled out in letters
One on every step
In a language that the cell knows how to read Inside the cell is a tiny double helix
Another fancy word for DNA
Which could also be a spiral staircase
Which could also be a twisted ladder
Which could also be a spring Which could also be a spiral staircase
Which could also be a twisted ladder
Or a crazy looking spring You called me last night on the telephone
And I was glad to hear from you 'cause I was all alone
You said, "It's snowing, it's snowing - God I hate this weather!"
Now I walk through blizzards just to get us back together We met in the springtime at a rock-n-roll show
It was on the Bowery when it was time to go
We kissed on the subway in the middle of the night
I held your hand, you held mine, it was the best night of my life 'Cause everyone's your friend in New York City
And everything looks beautiful when you're young and pretty
The streets are paved with diamonds and there's just so much to see
But the best thing about New York City is you and me Statue of Liberty, Staten Island Ferry,
Co-op City, "Cats" and Tiffany's
Central Park, Brooklyn Bridge
The Empire State where Dylan lived
Coney Island and Times Square
Rockefeller Center
Wish I was there You wrote me a letter just the other day
Said "Springtime is coming soon, so why don't you come to stay?"
I packed my stuff, got on the bus, I can't believe it's true
I'm three days from New York City and I'm three days from you 'Cause everyone's my friend in New York City
And everything looks beautiful when you're young and pretty
The streets are paved with diamonds and there's just so much to see
But the best thing about New York City is you and me 'Cause everyone's my friend in New York City
And everything looks beautiful when you're young and pretty
The streets are paved with diamonds and there's just so much to see
But the best thing about New York City is you and me You, to me
Are sweet as roses in the morning
You, to me
Are soft as summer in that dawning love we share
That something rare The sidewalks and the street
The concrete and the clay beneath my feet
Begin to crumble
But love will never die
You know we'll see the mountains crumble
Before we say goodbye
My love and I will be
In love eternally
That's the way
That's the way love was meant to be All around
I see the purple shades of evening
On the ground
The shadow's fallen, once again you're in my arms
So tenderly The sidewalks and the street
The concrete and the clay beneath my feet
Begin to crumble
But love will never die
You know we'll see the mountains crumble
Before we say goodbye
My love and I will be
In love eternally
That's the way
That's the way love was meant to be The sidewalks and the street
The concrete and the clay beneath my feet
Begin to crumble
But love will never die
You know we'll see the mountains crumble
Before we say goodbye
My love and I will be
In love eternally
That's the way
That's the way love was meant to be That's the way
That's the way love was meant to be You and I will be together
When we shed our memory
I won't wear an orange sweater
When I get it off of me
When it's as it someday is
It always will have been the case
When your ever-searching finger
Finds the button marked erase
Finger find the button marked erase
Like a deep sea diver Falling into a mermaid's embrace
Put one box on the sidewalk
Then you return with the next
And the first one's gone
Everyone gets on the bus out of town
And the lights start going out one by one
Button marked erase
When darlings must be murdered
When your heartbreak overwhelms your heart
Think of this as solving problems
That should never have occurred
Please don't call it strangulation
That is such an ugly word
Press erase, ignore the shrill alarms
See the way the deep sea diver
Falls into the mermaid's arms
Put one box on the sidewalk
Then you return with the next
And the first one's gone
Everyone gets on the bus out of town
And the lights start going out one by one
Button marked erase
When darlings must be murdered
When your heartbreak overrides the very
Thing you can not face
The skeletons that won't stay down
The mercy kill that can't be drowned
Put
Box
Sidewalk
Then
Return
Next
First one gone
Everyone
On
Bus
Out
Lights
Out
One by one
Finger find the button marked erase
Like a deep sea diver
Falling into a mermaid's embrace
Put one box on the sidewalk
Then you return with the next
And the first one's gone
Everyone gets on the bus out of town
And the lights start going out one by one All the people are so happy now, their heads are cavin' in
I'm glad they are a snowman with protective rubber skin
But every little thing's a domino that falls on different dots
And crashes into everything that tries to make it stop And the mirror, it reflects a tiny dancin' skeleton
Surrounded by a fleshy overcoat and swaddled in
A furry hat, elastic mask, a pair of shiny marble dice
Some people call them snake eyes, but to me, they look like mice And nothing's smellin' like a rose
But I don't care if no one's comin' up for air
'Cause I know nothing's gonna change my clothes ever anymore All the people are so happy now, their heads are cavin' in
I'm glad they are a snowman with protective rubber skin
But every little thing's a domino that falls on different dots
And crashes into everything that tries to make it stop And nothing's smellin' like a rose
But I don't care if no one's comin' up for air
I know nothing's gonna change my clothes ever anymore No, no, no, no, nothing's smellin' like a rose
But I don't care if no one's coming up for air
I know that nothing's gonna change my clothes ever anymore Oh
Ahh Theres a knock at the door that I adore
Theres a face at the window, a smiling yellow face
Theres a knock at the door
And if I were at home theyd find me there Theres a note on the door that I would see
And the furnitures barely been moved from where it was
Theres a note on the door
And the note would say when it rains it snows When it rains it snows, I wonder why
And now I know that when it rains it snows Theres a nut with a shotgun bang bang bang
Theres a doctor, a waitress, a fireman with a hat
Theres a nut with a gun
Theres enough so theyll never know which one When it rains it snows, I wonder why
And now I know that when it rains it snows I returned a bag of groceries
accidently taken off the shelf
before the expiration date
i came back as a bag of groceries
accidently taken off the shelf
before the date stamped on myself
Did a large procession wave their (did a)
torches as my head fell in the basket, (large pro-)
and was everybody dancing on the casket? (cession dance?)
Now it's over i'm dead and i haven't done anything that i want (now it's over)
or, i'm still alive and there's nothing i want to do
I will never say the word
"procrastinate" again; i'll never
see myself in the mirror with my eyes closed
i didn't apologize for
when i was eight and i made my younger brother
have to be my personal slave
Did a large procession wave their (did a)
torches as my head fell in the basket, (large pro-)
and was everybody dancing on the casket? (cession dance?)
Now it's over i'm dead and i haven't done anything that i want (now it's over)
or, i'm still alive and there's nothing i want to do
(so) so i won't
(sit) sit at home
(and) anymore
(and) and you won't
(and) see my head in
(and) the window
(and) and i won't
(and) be around
(and) ever anymore
(and) and i'll be up there on the wall at the store
I returned a bag of groceries
accidently taken off the shelf
before the expiration date
i came back as a bag of groceries
accidently taken off the shelf
before the date stamped on myself
Did a large procession wave their (did a)
torches as my head fell in the basket, (large pro-)
and was everybody dancing on the casket? (cession dance?) Now it's over i'm dead and i haven't done anything that i want (now it's over)
or, i'm still alive and there's nothing i want to do
Now it's over i'm dead and i haven't done anything that i want (now it's over)
or, i'm still alive and there's nothing i want to do And we'll go out on the town
Why don't you let me call you that?
You're acting so much like my mom
She didn't like it when I called her name
You and her are the same Chorus:
When we go out, you'll know someone who's there
You will feel someone's staring at you
You're on my mind, as I dream of the game
When I'm holding you,
Then I turn around to find that you were gone
Which was exactly like my mom!
And I will go hang up my sailor suit
Right face down on the lawn When we go out, you'll know someone is there
You will feel someone's staring at you
You're on my mind, as I dream of a game
When I'm holding you,
Then I turn around to find that you were gone
Which was exactly like my mom!
And I will go hang up my sailor suit
Right face down on the lawn I see you moving towards the deck,
Cause you don't trust me anymore
I need to find someone who's nice to me
The way that you used to be
And then I'm gonna call her you
Cause she'll remind me of you
I'm gonna dress her in the sailor suit
That will look very cute Chorus
When we go out, she'll know someone is there
You will feel someone's staring at her
She's on my mind, as I dream of a game
When she's holding you,
Then she turns around to find that I am gone
Which was exactly like my mom!
And she will go hang uṗ her sailor suit
Right face down on the lawn Underneath a big clock
At the corner of 5th Avenue and 22nd Street
I stood and waited for a girl I knew
At the spot where we agreed to meet
It was four minutes of two At four of two, I stood waiting for the girl
I was four minutes early for the date we had planned
I was planning to say I was in love with her
Just as soon as she showed for a two o'clock date
And the clock said four of two At four of two, I was staring into space
She was not yet late, according to the clock
I was feeling nervous so I kept looking up
At the clock sticking out of the side of the building
And it still said four of two At four of two, I began to feel tired
And I rubbed my eyes, and again I checked the time
It seemed as if the sky was growing dark
But I felt reassured when I looked at the clock
And it still said four of two I lay my head down on the sidewalk
So in case she were coming I would have a better view
But no one was there so I stretched out
And closed my eyes for a second or two
It was four minutes of two At once I awoke to a futuristic world
There were flying cars and gigantic metal bugs
I'd grown a beard, it was long and white
But I knew that the girl would be coming very soon
For though everything had changed, there was still that clock
And it still said four of two In my prison cell I think these words
I was careless
I can see that now
I must be silent
Must contain my secret smile
I want to tell you
you my mirror
you my iron bars When I made a shadow on my window shade
They called the police and testified
But they're like the people chained up in the cave
In the allegory of the people in the cave by the Greek guy No one understands
No one knows my plan
Why the dancing, shouting
Why the shrieks of pain
The lovely music
Why the smell of burning autumn leaves No one understands
No one knows my plan
Why the dancing, shouting
Why the shrieks of pain
The lovely music
Why the smell of burning autumn leaves In my prison cell I bide my time
Always thinking
Always busy cooking up an angle
Working on the tiny blueprint of the angle
Sketching out the burning autumn leaves No one understands
No one knows my plan
I must be silent, must contain my secret smile
I want to tell you
you my mirror
you my iron bars No one understands
No one knows my plan All my friends are beneath the planet of the apes
All my friends are
All my friends are
All my friends are beneath the planet of the apes
And when I get there
I'll find my friends there
Deep inside the ground
Underneath the town Where the apes live
Where the apes live
You can't walk around
Because it is in town
All my friends are
All my friends are
Beneath the planet
Of the apes No is no
No is always no
If they say no, it means a thousand times no No plus no equals no
All nos lead to no no no Finger pointing, eyebrows low
Mouth in the shape of the letter O Pardon me -- No!
Excuse me -- No!
May I stay?
Can I go?
No, no, no Do this -- No!
Don't do that -- No!
Sit, stay, roll over
No, no, no Finger pointing, eyebrows low
Mouth in the shape of the letter O
Red means stop. Do not go.
No, no, no Now, in the summer of life, sweetheart
You say you love but me
Gladly I give all my heart to you
Throbbing with ecstasy
But last night I saw, while a-dreaming,
The future old and gray,
And I wondered if you'll love me then, dear
Just as you do today? Will you love me in December as you do in May?
Will you love me in the good old-fashioned way?
When my hair has all turned gray,
Will you kiss me then and say,
That you love me in December as you do in May? You say the glow on my cheek, sweetheart
Is like the rose so sweet
But when the bloom of fair youth has flown
Then will our lips still meet?
When life's setting sun fades away, dear,
And all is said and done,
Will you arms still entwine and caress me?
Will our hearts beat as one? Will you love me in December as you do in May?
Will you love me in the good old-fashioned way?
When my hair has all turned gray,
Will you kiss me then and say,
That you love me in December as you do in May? XTC versus Adam Ant
Content versus form
Fighting for their place in rock and roll
There is no right or wrong Just when you think it's finished
With XTC on top
Ant music, like a phoenix
Flies back up the charts XTC versus Adam Ant
Only one will survive
Beetle based pop versus new romantic
History will decide XTC versus Adam Ant
I can't tell you why
Even the singer from Bow Wow Wow
Can't make up her mind XTC versus Adam Ant
Time is marching on
XTC versus Adam Ant There is no right or wrong
There is no right or wrong
There is no right or wrong I've been working hard, trying to sing and play guitar.
Growing out my hair, and practicing my stare. Paid to fake it in a traveling band,

Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la Planning midnight raids on our unsuspecting fans,
While roadies rig the video surveillance van. Paid to fake it in a traveling band,
And I'm working undercover for the man.
Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la I've been working hard, trying to sing and play guitar.
Growing out my hair, and practicing my stare. Paid to fake it in a traveling band,
And I'm working undercover for the man.
Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la "Yo yo yo! Come on come on!" Now every evening, when all my day's work is through
I call my baby, and ask her what we could do
I mention movies, she doesn't seem to dig that
And then she asks me, Why don't I come to her flat
And have some supper, and let the evening pass by
By playing records, the sounds of groovy hi-fi? I say "yeh yeh"
That's what I say
I say "yeh yeh" My baby loves me, she gets me feelin' so fine
And when she loves me, she makes me know that she's mine
And when she kisses, I feel the fire get hot
She never misses, she gives it all that she's got
And when she asks me if everything is okay
I give the answer, the only thing I can say I say "yeh yeh"
That's what I say
I say "yeh yeh" We'll play a melody and turn the lights down low
So that none can see
We gotta do that, we gotta do that
We gotta do that, we gotta do that
And there'll be no one else alive in all the world 'cept you and me Yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh
Yeh yeh yeh yeh And pretty baby, I never knew such a thrill (whoa)
It's hard to tell you, because I'm tremblin' still (whoa)
No need to ask me if everything is okay (whoa)
I got my answer, the only thing I can say (whoa) I say "yeh yeh"
That's what I say
I say "yeh yeh" Ahh! Open your mind (whoa)
to electric guitars! (whoa)
Open your mind! (whoa) We'll play a melody and turn the lights down low so that none can see
We gotta do that, we gotta do that
We gotta do that, we gotta do that
And there'll be no one else alive in all the world 'cept you and me Yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh
Yeh yeh yeh yeh And pretty baby, I never knew such a thrill
It's hard to tell you, because I'm tremblin' still
But pretty baby, I want you all for my own
I think I'm ready to leave those others alone
No need to ask me if everything is okay
I got my answer, the only thing I can say I say "yeh yeh"
That's what I say
I say "yeh yeh"
That's what I say
I say "yeh yeh"
That's what I say
I say "yeh yeh" Ladies and gentlemen
Ladies and gentlemen Spider

He is our hero I'm impressed, I'm impressed
When that gorilla beats his chest
Fall to bits, I confess, I admit, I'm impressed
When the torpedo in the vest barks, his orders, I'm impressed And I find that my head's nodding yes
Though my legs are not following
I'm inspired by events
To remember the exits in back of me I'm impressed, I'm impressed
When that gorilla pounds his desk
I fall to bits, I confess, I admit, I'm impressed
Through generalissimo's request, I can't help but feel impressed On the one hand
He'll give you five good reasons to follow him
On the other hand
You see nobody leaving the stadium I'm impressed, I'm impressed
By that Godzilla's flaming breath
I fall to bits, I confess, I admit, I'm impressed
When the tornado from the west crushes buildings, I'm impressed And I find that my head's nodding yes
Though my legs are not following
I'm inspired by events
To remember the exits in back of me I'm impressed, I'm impressed
When that gorilla beats his chest
I fall to bits, I confess, I admit, I'm impressed
When the torpedo in the vest barks his orders, I'm impressed We've been driving around
From one end of this town
To the other and back
But no one's ever seen us
Driving our Econoline van
And no one's ever heard of our band We're the Mesopotamians
Sargon, Hammurabi, Ashurbanipal and Gilgamesh And they wouldn't understand a word we say
So we'll scratch it all down into the clay
Half-believing there will sometime come a day
Someone gives a damn
Maybe when the concrete has crumbled to sand We're the Mesopotamians
Sargon, Hammurabi, Ashurbanipal and Gilgamesh The Mesopotamish sun is beating down
And making cracks in the ground
But there's nowhere else to stand
In Mesopotamia
(But no one's ever seen us)
The kingdom where we secretly reign
(And no one's ever heard of our band)
The land where we invisibly rule As the Mesopotamians
Sargon, Hammurabi, Ashurbanipal and Gilgamesh This is my last stick of gum
I'm going to cut it up so everybody else gets some
Except for Ashurbanipal, who says my haircut
makes me look like a Mohenjo-Daren
Hey, Ashurbanipal I'm a Mesopotamian
Sargon, Hammurabi, Ashurbanipal and Gilgamesh
We're the Mesopotamians
Sargon, Hammurabi, Ashurbanipal and Gilgamesh Hey, man, I thought that you were dead
I thought you crashed your car
No, man, I've been right here this whole time
Playing bass guitar For the Mesopotamians
Sargon, Hammurabi, Ashurbanipal
Sargon, Hammurabi, Ashurbanipal and Gilgamesh
We're the Mesopotamians
Sargon, Hammurabi, Ashurbanipal and Gilgamesh Spiderman, spiderman...

We're in a road movie to berlin
can't drive out the way we drove in
so sneak out this glass of bourbon
and we'll go
We were once so close to heaven
peter came out and gave us medals
declaring us the nicest of the damned
Time won't find the lost
it'll sweep up our skeleton bones
so take the wheel and i will take the pedals
We're in a road movie to berlin
can't drive out the way we drove in
so sneak out this glass of bourbon
and we'll go notes
The dial-a-song version (which is closer to the version printed in the flood liner notes) goes as follows:
We're in a road movie to berlin
can't drive out the way you drove in
so sneak out this glass of bourbon
and we'll go
We were once so close to heaven
peter came out and gave us medals
declaring us the nicest of the damned
You said you were the king of liars
and i believed you and called you sire
but i realize now that i have been deceived

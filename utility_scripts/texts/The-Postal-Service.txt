I am thinking it's a sign
That the freckles in our eyes
Are mirror images
And when we kiss they're perfectly aligned And I have to speculate
That God himself did make
Us into corresponding shapes
Like puzzle pieces from the clay And true it may seem like a stretch
But it's thoughts like this that catch
My troubled head when you're away
When I am missing you to death When you are out there on the road
For several weeks of shows
And when you scan the radio
I hope this song will guide you home They will see us waving from such great heights
"Come down now"
They'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
"Come down now"
But we'll stay I tried my best to leave
This all on your machine
But the persistent beat
It sounded thin upon listening And that frankly will not fly
You will hear the shrillest highs
And lowest lows with the windows down
When this is guiding you home They will see us waving from such great heights
"Come down now"
They'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
"Come down now"
But we'll stay They will see us waving from such great heights
"Come down now"
They'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
"Come down now"
But we'll stay
They will see us waving from such great heights
"Come down now"
They will see us waving from such great heights
"Come down now" Would someone please call a surgeon
Who can crack my ribs and repair this broken heart
That you're deserting for better company I can't accept that it's over
And I will block the door
Like a goalie tending the net
In the third quarter
Of a tied game rivalry So just say how to make it right
And I swear I'll do my best to comply Tell me am I right to think that there could be nothing better
Than making you my bride and slowly growing old together I feel I must interject here
You're getting carried away
Feeling sorry for yourself
With these revisions and gaps in history So let me help you remember
I've made charts and graphs
That should finally make it clear
I've prepared a lecture
On why I have to leave So please back away and let me go I can't my darling; I love you so
Oh oh
Tell me am I right to think that there could be nothing better
Than making you my bride and slowly growing old together Don't you feed me lies about some idealistic future
Your heart won't heal right if you keep tearing out the sutures I know that I have made mistakes
And I swear I'll never wrong you again You've got allure I can't deny
But you've had your chance
So say goodbye Say goodbye I'll be the grapes fermented, bottled and served with the table set
In my finest suit, like a perfect gentleman
I'll be the fire escape that's bolted to the ancient brick
Where you will sit and contemplate your day I'll be the waterwings that save you if you start drowning in
An open tab when your judgment's on the brink.
I'll be the phonograph that plays your favorite
Albums back as you're lying there
Drifting off to sleep (drifting off to sleep) I'll be the platform shoes, undo what heredity's done to you
You won't have to strain to look into my eyes
I'll be your winter coat, buttoned and zipped straight to the throat
With the collar up so you won't catch a cold I want to take you far from the cynics in this town
And kiss you on the mouth
We'll cut our bodies free from the tethers of this scene
Start a brand new colony
Where everything will change, we'll give ourselves new names
Identities erased
The sun will heat the grounds under our bare feet
In this brand new colony (in this brand new colony) Everything will change, ooh
Everything will change, ooh
Everything will change, ooh Last week I had the strangest dream
Where everything was exactly how it seemed
Where there was never any mystery
Of who shot John F. Kennedy.
It was just a man with something to prove,
Slightly bored and severely confused.
He steadied his rifle with his target in the center
And became famous on that day in November. Don't wake me I plan on sleeping
Don't wake me I plan on sleeping in
Don't wake me I plan on sleeping
Don't wake me I plan on sleeping in Again last night I had that strange dream
Where everything was exactly how it seemed
No concerns about the world getting warmer
People thought that they were just being rewarded
For treating others as they'd like to be treated
For obeying stop signs and curing diseases
For mailing letters with the address of the sender.
Now we can swim any day in November. Don't wake me I plan on sleeping
(now we can swim any day in November)
Don't wake me I plan on sleeping in

Oooh, oooh I was waiting for a cross-town train in the London Underground
When it struck me
That I'd been waiting since birth to find a love that would look and sound
Like a movie
So I changed my plans, I rented a camera and a van
And then I called you
I need you to pretend that we are in love again
And you agreed to I want so badly to believe that there is truth
And love is real
And I want life in every word
To the extent that it's absurd I grease the lens and frame the shot
Using a friend as my stand-in
The script had called for rain, but it was clear that day
So we faked it
The marker snapped and I yelled, "Quiet on the set!"
And then called, "Action!"
I kissed you in a style Clark Gable would have admired
I thought it classic I want so badly to believe that there is truth
That love is real
And I want life in every word to the extent
That it's absurd
I know you're wise beyond your years
But do you ever get the fear
That your perfect verse is just a lie
You tell yourself to help you get by That you tell yourself to help you get by
That you tell yourself to help you get by It was familiar to me
The smoke too thick to breathe
The tile floors glistened
I slowly stirred my drink And when you started to sing
You spoke with broken speech
That I could not understand
And then you grabbed me tightly I won't let go, I won't let go
Even if you say so, oh no
I've tried and tried with no results
I won't let go, I won't let go He then played every song from 1993
The crowd applauded as he curtsied bashfully
Your eyelashes tickled my neck
With every nervous blink And it was perfect until the telephone started
Ringing, ringing, ringing, ringing, ringing, off Smeared black ink
Your palms are sweaty
And I'm barely listening
To last demands
I'm staring at the asphalt wondering
What's buried underneath Where I am I wear my badge
A vinyl sticker with big block letters
Adhering to my chest
That tells your new friends:
I am a visitor here; I am not permanent
And the only thing
Keeping me dry is (Where I am)
You seem so out of context
In this gaudy apartment complex
A stranger with your door key
Explaining that I'm just visiting
And I am finally seeing
Why I was the one worth leaving
Why I was the one worth leaving D.C. sleeps alone tonight (Where I am)
You seem so out of context
In this gaudy apartment complex
A stranger with your door key
Explaining that I'm just visiting
And I am finally seeing
Why I was the one worth leaving
Why I was the one worth leaving (Where I am)
The district sleeps alone tonight
After the bars turn out their lights
And send the autos swerving
Into the loneliest evening
And I am finally seeing
Why I was the one worth leaving
Why I was the one worth leaving
Why I was the one worth leaving
Why I was the one worth leaving I take a breath and pull the air in
'Til there's nothing left
I'm feeling green like
Teenage lovers between the sheets Ba, ba ba ba, ba, ba ba ba
Ba, ba ba ba, ba, ba ba
Ba, ba ba ba, ba, ba ba ba
Ba, ba ba ba, ba, ba ba Knuckles clenched to white
(Knuckles clenched to white)
As the landing gear retract for flight
My head's a balloon
(My head's a balloon)
Inflating with the altitude Ba, ba ba ba, ba, ba ba ba
Ba, ba ba ba, ba, ba ba
Ba, ba ba ba, ba, ba ba ba
Ba, ba ba ba, ba, ba ba Ba, ba ba ba, ba, ba ba ba I watch the patchwork farms
Slow fade into the ocean's arms
And from here they can't see me stare
The stale taste of recycled air I watch the patchwork farms'
(I watched)
Slow fade into the ocean's arms
(Slow fade)
Calm down, release your cares
(Calm down)
The stale taste of recycled air
(The stale) I watch the patchwork farms
Slow fade into the ocean's arms
And from here they can't see me stare
The stale taste of recycled air I watch the patchwork farms
Slow fade into the ocean's arms
Calm down, release your cares
The stale taste of recycled air I saw you standing there
The wind blowing your hair
It's fate my life has brought me here to you You walked over my way
I didn't know what to say.
I think that I love you.
But maybe it's just the fumes Angel pumping gas
Why won't this moment last?
It's fate my life has brought me here today
Soon I'll be on my way
though I'd really like to stay
But the road is out there calling me away.
But I really need you here with me today. You asked what can I do
I say unleaded fuel
You open up my tank start the pump Grab a wet squeegee
and wipe my windshield clean.
When all the while my tank is filling up Angel pumping gas
Why won't this moment last?
It's fate my life has brough me here today
Soon I'll be on my way
though I'd really like to stay.
But the road is out there calling me away.
But I really need you here with me today. You asked will that be credit or cash
But my chevron card was lost in the trash
You say that you will have to pay inside
as my heart broke in two I felt like I could die as I turn the key her eyes contact with me
we share our precious moment in a glance
and as I drive away her memories here to stay
her deep blue eyes have left me in a trance Angel pumping gas
Why won't this moment last?
It's fate my life has brought me here today
Soon I'll be on my way
though I wish that I could stay
But the road is out there calling me away. well maybe things are better off this way. Grow old along with me
The best is yet to be
When our time has come
We will be as one
God bless our love
God bless our love Grow old along with me
Two branches of one tree
Face the setting sun
When the day is done
God bless our love
God bless our love Spending our lives together
Man and wife together
World without end
World without end Grow old along with me
Whatever fate decrees
We will see it through
For our love is true
God bless our love
God bless our love I am thinking it's a sign
That the freckles in our eyes are mirror images
And when we kiss they're perfectly aligned And I have to speculate
That God himself did make
Us into corresponding shapes
Like puzzle pieces from the clay And true, it may seem like a stretch
But it's thoughts like this that catch
My troubled head when you're away
When I am missing you to death When you are out there on the road
For several weeks of shows
And when you scan the radio
I hope this song will guide you home They will see us waving from such great heights
"Come down now", they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
Come down now, but we'll stay I tried my best to leave
This all on your machine
But the persistent beat it sounded thin
Upon listening And that frankly will not fly
You will hear the shrillest highs
And lowest lows with the windows down
When this is guiding you home They will see us waving from such great heights
"Come down now", they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
Come down now, but we'll stay I was running late for work
So I didn't change my shirt
The evening's drinks
Left a lingering taste in my mouth And when I left you were fast asleep
Tangled in the sheets
And on the bus I could have sworn it was all a dream
And it didn't happen to me And then I felt the scrapes
From the slippery subway grate
Oh, how you laughed
At my complete lack of grace But I could not recall
A more perfect fall
'Cause when I looked up into your eyes
It didn't hurt at all And I thought, be still my heart
This could be a brand new start with you
And it will be clear if I wake up and you're still here
With me in the morning And I thought, be still my heart
This could be a brand new start with you
And it will be clear if I wake up and you're still here
With me in the morning Be still my heart
This could be a brand new start with you
And it will be clear if I wake up and you're still here
With me in the morning I am thinking it's a sign
That the freckles in our eyes
Are mirror images
And when we kiss they're perfectly aligned And I have to speculate
That God Himself did make

Come down now, they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
Come down now but we'll stay I tried my best to leave

It sounded thin upon the sending And that frankly will not fly
You'll hear the shrillest highs
And lowest lows with the windows down
And this is guiding you home They will see us waving from such great heights
Come down now they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
Come down now but we'll stay They will see us waving from such great heights
Come down now they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
Come down now but we'll stay (They will see us waving from such great heights)
(Come down now)
They will see us waving from such great heights
(Come down now) Putting all the vegetables away
That you bought at the grocery store today
And it goes fast, you think of the past Suddenly everything has changed. Driving home, the sky accelerates.
And the clouds all form a geometric shape.
And it goes fast, you think of the past. Suddenly everything has changed. Putting all the clothes you washed away.
As you're folding up the shirts, you hesitate.
Then it goes fast, you think of the past. Suddenly everything has changed. In due time
We'll finally see
There's barely time
For us to breathe In due time
We'll finally see
There's barely time
For us to breathe In due time
We'll finally see
There's barely time
For us to breathe I've got a cupboard with cans of food
Filtered water and pictures of you
And I'm not coming out until this is all over And I'm looking through the glass
Where the light bends at the cracks
And I'm screaming at the top of my lungs
Pretending the echoes belong to someone
Someone I used to know And we become
Silhouettes when our bodies finally go I wanted to walk through the empty streets
And feel something constant under my feet
But all the news reports recommended that I stay indoors Because the air outside will make
Our cells divide at an alarming rate
Until our shells simply cannot hold
All our inside's in and that's when we'll explode
And it won't be a pretty sight And we'll become
Silhouettes when our bodies finally go
And we'll become
Silhouettes when our bodies finally go And we'll become
Silhouettes when our bodies finally go
And we'll become
Silhouettes when our bodies finally go We'll become
We'll become
We'll become
I will become, I will become This place is a prison
These people aren't your friends
Inhaling thrills through twenty dollar bills
and the tumblers are drained and then flooded
again and again. There's guards at the onramps
Armed to the teeth
And you may case the grounds
from the Cascades to Puget Sound
but you are not permitted to leave. I know there's a big world out there
like the one that I saw on the screen
in my living room late last night
It was almost too bright to see. And I know that it's not a party
if it happens every night
pretending there's glamor and candelabra
when you're drinking by candlelight. And what does it take
to get a drink in this place?
What does it take?
How long must I wait? And what does it take
to get a drink in this place?
What does it take?
How long must I wait? How long must I wait? Will someone please call a surgeon
Who can crack my ribs and repair this broken heart
That you're deserting for better company I can't accept that it's over
And I will block the door like a goalie tending the net
In the third quarter of a tied-game rivalry So, just say how to make it right
And I swear I'll do my best to comply Tell me am I right to think that there could be nothing better
Than making you my bride and slowly growing old together? I feel must I interject here
You're getting carried away feeling sorry for yourself
With these revisions and gaps in history So let me help you remember
I've made charts and graphs that should finally make it clear
I've prepared a lecture on why I have to leave So please back away and let me go
I can't my darling I love you so but oh, oh Tell me am I right to think that there could be nothing better
Than making you my bride and slowly growing old together? Don't you feed me lines about some idealistic future
Your heart won't heal right if you keep tearing out the sutures I know that I have made mistakes
And I swear I'll never wrong you again
You've got allure I can't deny
But you've had your chance so say goodbye
Say goodbye I'll write you a song and it won't be hard to sing
It will be a natural anthem, familiar it may seem
It will rally all the workers on strike for better pay
And its chorus will resound and boost morale throughout the day I'll write you a song and I hope that you won't mind
Because all the names and places, I have taken from real life
So please, don't be upset at this portrait that I paint
It may be a little biased but at least I spelt your name right How can I just let you walk away; just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking every breath with you? oo-ooh
You're the only one who really knew me at all How can you just walk away from me,
When all I can do is watch you leave?
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain and even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all So take a look at me now:
Well there's just an empty space.
There's nothing left here to remind me;
Just the memory of your face.
Well take a look at me now:
There's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds and that's what I've gotta face. I wish I could just make you turn around;
Turn around and see me cry.
There's so much I need to say to you,
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all So take a look at me now:
Oh there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me, just the mem'ry of your face
Well take a look at me now:
There's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do and that's what I've gotta face
'ell Take a look at me now:
I'll just be standing here
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And that's a chance I've gotta face. Take a look at me now Take a look at me now
(Take a look at me now) Take a look at me now
(Take a look at me now) Take a look at me now
(Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now) Take a look at me now
(Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now) Take a look at me now
(Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now) Take a look at me now
(Take a look at me now) Take a look at me now (1 min. and 4 secs. of no lyrcis just music.) In due time, you'll finally see.
There's barely time, for us to breath.
In due time, we'll finally see
There's barely time, for us to breath. (No lyrics just music.) In due time, we''l finally see.
There's barely time, for us to breath. You can turn the city upside-down if you want to
But it won't keep you dry
You can turn the city upside-down, like an umbrella
But it won't keep you dry
When you wrap yourself in a highway strip
don't expect any warmth from it
All it is, is cold cement
You can turn the city upside-down, like an umbrella
But who knows what you'll find
Be careful if you try
You can turn the city upside-down if you want to
But it won't keep you dry (keep you dry) it was familiar to me

This could be a brand new start with you
And it will be clear if I wake up and you're still here
With me in the morning We drained every dime, in the lower east side
And you failed to catch the train back to Queens
So you came to my room
We did some things that we knew not to do
In the glow of the night's golden hue You've got a tattered line of string
And you tied 'round everything
That you want to call your own
But it never seems to hold When we walk, we agreed
That we would not ever speak of
of this night to anyone that we both knew
Then you said
"Every time we kissed
I felt something that couldn't exist"
And I confessed that I thought I felt it too I've got a tattered line of string
And I tied 'round everything
That I want to call my own
But it never seems to hold I've got a tattered light of string
And I tied 'round everything
That I want to call my own
But it never seems to hold You've got a tattered light of string
And you tied 'round everything
That you want to call your own

"Come down now" they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away

But the persistent beat
It sounded thin upon listening. And that frankly will not fly

A vinyl sticker with big block letters
Adhering to my chest
That tells your new friends:
I am a visitor here; I am not permanent
And the only thing
Keeping me dry is (Where I am)
You seem so out of context
In this gaudy apartment complex
A stranger with your door key
Explaining that I'm just visiting
And I am finally seeing
Why I was the one worth leaving
Why I was the one worth leaving D.C. sleeps alone tonight (Where I am)
You seem so out of context
In this gaudy apartment complex
A stranger with your door key
Explaining that I'm just visiting
And I am finally seeing
Why I was the one worth leaving
Why I was the one worth leaving (Where I am)
The district sleeps alone tonight
After the bars turn out their lights
And send the autos swerving
Into the loneliest evening
And I am finally seeing
Why I was the one worth leaving
Why I was the one worth leaving
Why I was the one worth leaving
Why I was the one worth leaving Cool hands, warm heart,
Big dreams, false starts
Those pills, don't work
They just, make it worse
Don't say, you're through
I'll swim, beside you
This town, this sea
Won't drag you underneath You gotta know that this will turn around
Until then I will not let you down
When you find your ship has run aground
You can call me, I won't let you down
I won't let you down,
This will turn around Sick days, drunk nights,
Short fuse, loud fights,
Lose weight: all bones,
White trucks, the undertow
Don't say, you're done
Cause you're brave and you're loved
This town, this sea
It won't drag you underneath You gotta know that this will turn around
Until then I will not let you down
When you find your ship has run aground
You can call me, I won't let you down
I won't let you down,
This will turn around I won't let you down
You know that this'll turn around Turn around, turn around, turn around oh
Turn around, turn around, turn around oh
Turn around, turn around, turn around oh
Turn around, turn around, turn around oh
Turn around, turn around, turn around oh
Turn around, turn around, turn around oh
Turn around, turn around, turn around oh
Turn around, turn around, turn around oh

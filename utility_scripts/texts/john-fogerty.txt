Chorus:
Don't mess with my toot toot, don't mess with my toot toot,
Well you can have the other woman, but don't mess with my toot toot. She was born in her birth suit, the doctor slap her behind, (slap!)
Say you're gonna to be special, you sweet little toot toot.
Well you can look as much, but if you much as touch,
You're gonna have yourself a case - I'm gonna break your face! Chorus
Oh toot, hey! Whoa, mama was the same way too, all the fellas didn't know what to do,
And papa never had a chance, with a sweet little toot toot.
She was born in her birth suit, the doctor slap her behind, (slap!)
Said you're gonna to be special, you sweet little toot toot. Chorus Now, when i just was a little boy,
standin to my daddy's knee,
my poppa said "son, don't let the man get you
and do what he done to me." i can remember the fourth of july,
runnin' through the backwood bare.
and i can still hear my old hound dog barkin',
chasin' down a hoodoo there,
chasin' down a hoodoo there.
Born on the bayou
born on the bayou
born on the bayou
Wish i was back on the bayou,
rollin' with some cajun queen.
wishin' i where a fast freight train,
just a chooglin' on down to new orleans.

Over by the courthouse they're starting to unwind.
Four kids on the corner trying to bring you up.
Willy picks a tune out and he blows it on the harp. Down On The Corner out in the street
Willy and the Poorboys are playin';
Bring a nickel; tap your feet. Rooster hits the washboard and people just got to smile
Blinky thumps the gut bass and solos for a while.
Poorboy twangs the rhythm out on his kalamazoo.
Willy goes into a dance and doubles on kazoo. Down On The Corner, out in the street,
Willy and the Poorboys are playin';
Bring a nickel; tap your feet. Down On The Corner, out in the street,
Willy and the Poorboys are playin';
Bring a nickel; tap your feet. You don't need a penny just to hang around,
But if you've got a nickel, won't you lay your money down?
Over on the corner there's a happy noise.
People come from all around to watch the magic boy. Down On The Corner, out in the street,
Willy and the Poorboys are playin';
Bring a nickel; tap your feet. Down On The Corner, out in the street,

Than the vainest knife
Moody river your muddy waters
Took my baby's life Last Saturday evening
I came to the old oak tree
It stands beside the river
Where you were to meet me On the ground your glove I found
With a note addressed to me
It read, dear love, I've done you wrong
Now I must set you free No longer can I live
With this hurt and this sin
I just couldn't tell you
That guy was just a friend Moody river more deadly
Than the vainest knife
Moody river your muddy waters
Took my baby's life I looked into the muddy water
And what could I see?
I saw a lonely, lonely face
Just lookin' back at me Tears in his eyes
And a prayer on his lips
And the glove of his lost love
Was at his fingertips Moody river more deadly
Than the vainest knife
Moody river your muddy waters
Took my baby's life Moody river more deadly
Than the vainest knife
Moody river your muddy waters
Took my baby's life Some folks are born made to wave the flag
They're red, white and blue
And when the band plays, 'Hail to the Chief'
They point the cannon right at you It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no senator's son
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one Some folks are born silver spoon in hand
Lord don't they help themselves?
But when the tax man comes to the door
Lord, the house looks like a rummage sale It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no millionaire's son
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one Some folks inherit star spangled eyes
They send you down to war
And when you ask them, "How much should we give?"
They only answer, "More, more, more" It ain't me, it ain't me
Ain't no military son
It ain't me, it ain't me
Ain't no fortunate one It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no millionaire's son
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no senator's son
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate
I ain't no fortunate
I ain't no fortunate
I ain't no fortunate
I ain't no fortunate son I've got a never ending love for you
From now on that's all I wanna do
From the first time we met I knew
I'd have a never ending love for you I've got a never ending love for you
From now on that's all I wanna do
From the first time we met I knew
I'd have a never ending love for you After all this time of being alone
We can love one another
Feel for each other from now on
Feels so good I can hardly stand it I've got a never ending love for you
From now on that's all I wanna do
From the first time we met I knew
I'd sing my never ending song of love for you, yeah After all this time of being alone
We can love one another
Live for each other from now on
Feels so good I can hardly stand it I've got a never ending love for you
From now on that's all I wanna do
From the first time we met I knew
I'd sing my never ending song of love for you
I've got a never ending love for you Nelson I went to a garden party to reminisce with my old friends
A chance to share old memories and play our songs again
When I got to the garden party, they all knew my name
No one recognized me, I didn't look the same. But it's all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, you can't please everyone, so you got to please yourself. People came from miles around, everyone was there
Yoko brought her Walrus, there was magic in the air
And over in the corner, much to my surprise
Mr. Hughes hid in Dylan's shoes wearing his disguise. But it's all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, you can't please everyone, so you got to please yourself. Lott-in-dah-dah-dah, lot-in-dah-dah-dah. Played them all the old songs, thought that's why they came
No one heard the music, we didn't look the same
I said hello to Mary Lou, she belongs to me
When I sang a song about a honky-tonk, it was time to leave. But it's all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, you can't please everyone, so you got to please yourself. Lot-dah-dah-dah (lot-dah-dah-dah) lot-in-dah-dah-dah. Someone opened up a closet door and out stepped Johnny B. Goode
Playing guitar like a-ringin' a bell and lookin' like he should
If you gotta play at garden parties, I wish you a lotta luck
But if memories were all I sang, I rather drive a truck. But it's all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, you can't please everyone, so you got to please yourself. Lot-dah-dah-dah (lot-dah-dah-dah) lot-in-dah-dah-dah. But it's all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, you can't please everyone, so you got to please yourself. My heart is breakin' darlin' and many tears are fallin'
Fallin', fallin', fallin' just for you
My eyes are burnin' darlin' while my heart is sad and yearnin'
Yearnin', yearnin', burnin' just for you Oh, you didn't have to go and leave me all alone
I'm sure you think that breakin' hearts is fun
But someday you may find out when your new love is gone
That deep down in your heart I'm still the one I need you with me darlin', always with me darlin'
Need you, need you, need you, I'm so blue
Oh, hear my callin' darlin' and stop these tears from fallin'
Fallin', fallin', fallin' just for you, yeah My heart is breakin' darlin' and many tears are fallin'
Fallin', fallin', fallin' just for you
My eyes are burnin' darlin' while my heart is sad and yearnin'
Yearnin', yearnin', burnin' just for you Well, you didn't have to go and leave me all alone
I'm sure you think that breakin' hearts is fun
But someday you may find out when your new love is gone
That deep down in your heart I'm still the one I need you with me darlin', always with me darlin'
Need you, need you, need you, I'm so blue
Oh, hear my callin' darlin' and stop these tears from fallin'
Fallin', fallin', fallin' just for you, yeah Just got home from Illinois, lock the front door, oh boy!
Got to sit down, take a rest on the porch.
Imagination sets in, pretty soon I'm singin', [Chorus:]
Doo, doo, doo, Lookin' out my back door. There's a giant doing cartwheels, a statue wearin' high heels.
Look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn.
A dinosaur Victrola list'ning to Buck Owens. [Chorus] Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band.
Won't you take a ride on the flyin' spoon?
Doo, doo doo.
Wond'rous apparition provided by magician. [Chorus] Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band.
Won't you take a ride on the flyin' spoon?
Doo, doo doo.
Bother me tomorrow, today, I'll buy no sorrows. [Chorus] Forward troubles Illinois, lock the front door, oh boy!
Look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn.
Bother me tomorrow, today, I'll buy no sorrows. [Chorus] Just about a year ago,
I set out on the road,
Seeking my fame and fortune,
Looking for a pot of gold.
Things got bad, and things got worse,
I guess you know the tune.
Oh! Lord, Stuck in Lodi again. Rode in on the Greyhound,
I'll be walking out if I go.
I was just passing through,
Must be seven months or more.
Ran out of time and money,
Looks like they took my friends.
Oh! Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again. The man from the magazine said I was on my way.
Somewhere I lost connections, ran out of songs to play.
I came into town, a one night stand,
Looks like my plans fell through
Oh! Lord, Stuck in Lodi again.
Mmmm... If I only had a dollar, for ev'ry song I've sung.
And ev'ry time I've had to play
While people sat there drunk.
You know, I'd catch the next train back to where I live.
Oh! Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again.
Oh! Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again. Mmmm, when the midnight ravens appear in your eyes,
Oh! and the mystery holdin' your soul is realized,
Shadows of night, faces in the fire, like visions in a dream, takin' me higher. Chorus:
You got the magic thrillin' me, you got the magic chillin' me,
You got the magic, shine your spell on me. Whoa, when the hoodoo children of night gather near,
Ah! when the whirlwind whispers your name, I can hear,
Wind in the willows, scratchin' in the sand,
And the whole universe is at your command there. Chorus
Yeah. You got the magic thrillin' me, you got the magic chillin' me, oooh!
You got the magic thrillin' me, you got the magic chillin' me, oooh!
You got the magic, shine your spell on me. Chorus
Chorus Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm
I know, it's been comin' for some time When it's over, so they say
It'll reign a sunny day
I know, shinin' down like water I wanna know have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know that have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day? Yesterday and days before
Sun is cold and rain is hard
I know, been that way for all my life 'Til forever, on it goes
Through the circle, fast and slow
I know, it can't stop, I wonder I wanna know that have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day? Yeah I wanna know that have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know that have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day? There's a place up ahead and I'm goin'
Just as fast as my feet can fly
Come away, come away if you're goin'
Leave the sinkin' ship behind Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend Bring a smile and a song for the banjo
Better get while the gettin's good
There's a place up ahead and I'm goin'
Where the neons, it turns to wood Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend You can ponder perpetual motion
Fix your mind on a crystal day
Always time for good conversation
There's an ear for what you say Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend Catch a ride to the end of the highway
And we'll meet by the big red tree
There's a place up ahead and I'm goin'
Come along, come along with me Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend Was Ridin' along side the highway, rollin' up the country side.
Thinkin' I'm the devil's heatwave, what you burn in your crazy mind?
Saw a slight distraction standin' by the road;
She was smilin' there, yellow in her hair;
Do you wanna, I was thinkin', would you care. Sweet Hitch-a-Hiker,
We could make music at the Greasy King.
Sweet Hitch-a-Hiker,
Won't you ride on my fast machine? Cruisin' on thru the junction, I'm flyin' 'bout the speed of sound,
Noticin' peculiar function, I ain't no roller coaster show me down.
I turned away to see her, Woa! she caught my eye,
But I was rollin' down, movin' too fast;
Do you wanna, She was thinkin' can it last. Sweet Hitch-a-Hiker,
We could make music at the Greasy King.
Sweet Hitch-a-Hiker,
Won't you ride on my fast machine? Was busted up along the highway, I'm the saddest ridin' fool alive.
Wond'ring if you're goin' in my way, won't you give a poor boy a ride?
Here she comes a ridin', Lord, She's flyin' high.
But she was rollin' down, movin' too fast;
Do you wanna, She was thinkin' can I last. Sweet Hitch-a-Hiker,
We could make music at the Greasy King.
Sweet Hitch-a-Hiker,
Won't you ride on my fast machine? Sweet Hitch-a-Hiker,
We could make music at the Greasy King.
Sweet Hitch-a-Hiker,
Won't you ride on my fast machine? Sweet Hitch-a-Hiker,
We could make music at the Greasy King.
Sweet Hitch-a-Hiker,
Won't you ride on my fast machine? Gabbard-Price Well, there ain't no chains strong enough to hold me

Clearwater!
Revival! Lately I begin to wonder,
How's it all gonna end
After all the flash and thunder,
Then it's gone with the wind All the stars in the heavens,
They been there to light my way.
Without knowin' where I'm going,
Probably get there anyway Mystic highway that I'm on
Ooh ooh, take me home
Mystic highway that I ramble
Ooh ooh take me home This old road has been my lifeline,
My companion and my friend
Like a rope around the universe,
Ain't no beginning, ain't no end Out across the constellations,
There's a place behind the sun
Everything is connected,
Everything and everyone Mystic highway that I'm on
Ooh ooh, take me home
Mystic highway that I ramble
Ooh ooh take me home Down by the river on Saturday night,
Everybody waiting for a good time
Smooth city slickers and loaded dice,
Take your money in a pig's eye
Rain gonna fall, sun gonna shine,
Ain't no worry in my mind
Big wheel rollin' cross the sky,
Ain't no worry in my mind All the stars that I'm under,
Know the way I feel tonight.
All the miles I've been travellin'
Headin' back to the light. Mystic highway that I'm on
Ooh ooh, take me home
Mystic highway that I ramble
Ooh ooh take me home
Ooh ooh take me home.
Yeah! There's a storm across the valley, clouds are rollin' in
The afternoon is heavy on your shoulders
There's a truck out on the four lane, a mile or more away
The whinin' of his wheels just makes it colder He's an hour away from ridin' on your prayers up in the sky
And ten days on your road are barely gone
There's a fire softly burnin', supper's on the stove
But it's the light in your eyes that makes him warm Hey, it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
Yes and hey, it's good to be back home again There's all the news to tell him, how'd you spend your time?
What's the latest thing the neighbors say?
And your mother called last Friday, sunshine made her cry
You felt the baby move just yesterday Hey, it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
Yes and hey, it's good to be back home again But the time that I can lay this tired old body down
Feel your fingers feather soft upon me
The kisses that I live for, the love that lights my way
The happiness that livin' with you brings me It's the sweetest thing I know of, just spending time with you
It's the little things that make a house a home
Like a fire softly burnin', supper on the stove
The light in your eyes that makes me warm Hey, it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
Yes and hey, it's good to be back home again Hey, it's good to be back home again, you know it is
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend
Hey, it's good to be back home again
I said hey, it's good to be back home again First thing I remember
Was asking papa why
For there were many things I didn't know And daddy always smiled
Took me by the hand
Saying, "someday you'll understand" Well, I'm here to tell you now each and every mother's son
You better learn it fast and you better learn it young
'Cause someday never comes The time and tears went by
And I collected dust
For there were many things I didn't know When daddy went away
He said, "try to be a man
And someday you'll understand" But I'm here to tell you now each and every mother's son
You better learn it fast you better learn it young
'Cause someday never comes And then one day in April
I wasn't even there
For there were many things I didn't know A son was born to me
Mama held his hand
Saying, "someday you'll understand" Well, I'm here to tell you now each and every mother's son
You better learn it fast and you better learn it young
'Cause someday never comes
Ooh, someday never comes Think it was September
The year I went away
For there were many things I didn't know And still I see him standing
Trying to be a man
I said, "someday you'll understand" But I'm here to tell you now each and every mother's son
You better learn it fast and you better learn it young
'Cause someday never comes
Ooh, someday never comes. When I was a child my family would travel
Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
There's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn And daddy, won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the green river where paradise lay?
Well, I'm sorry my son but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the green river
To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill And daddy, won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the green river where paradise lay?
Well, I'm sorry my son but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man And daddy, won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the green river where paradise lay?
Well, I'm sorry my son but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away When I die let my ashes float down the green river
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester Dam
I'll be halfway to heaven with paradise waiting
Just five miles away from wherever I am And daddy, won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the green river where paradise lay?
Well, I'm sorry my son but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away [Chorus:]
Honey do this
Honey do that
Work all day in The Honey Do Patch
Woman oh woman
What's a-wrong with you
I can't get away from The Honey Do Well way back in history
About a half million years
Back in the cradle of civilized fear
Saturday morning the cave man's wife
First spoke the words to make a grown man cry [Chorus] Well the weekend's here
And it's time to relax
Kick up my feet in the shade out back
But i must-a been thinking
About some other guy
'couse here comes The Warden
With a look in her eye [Chorus] Well I dreamed I died
And went up to heaven
No more weedin', mashin' and shovelin'
I'm standing in line at the old Pearly Gates
Up steps the woman
And hands me a rake [Chorus] What's that?
Yes dear
Alright honey Bootleg, bootleg
Bootleg, howl
Bootleg, bootleg
Bootleg, howl Take you a glass of water
Make it against the law
See how good the water tastes
When you can't have any at all Bootleg, bootleg
Bootleg, howl
Bootleg, bootleg
Bootleg, howl Findin' a natural woman
Like honey to the bee
But you don't buzz the flower
When you know the honey's free Bootleg, bootleg
Bootleg, howl
Bootleg, bootleg
Bootleg, howl Suzy maybe give you some cherry pie
But Lord, that ain't no fun
Better you grab it when she ain't lookin'
'Cause you know you'd rather have it on the run Bootleg, bootleg
Bootleg, howl
Bootleg, bootleg
Bootleg, howl Bootleg, bootleg
Bootleg, howl
Bootleg, bootleg

honey, get over here. Well, take me back down where cool water flow, yeh.
Let me remember things I love.
Stoppin' at the log where catfish bite,
walkin' along the river road at night,
barefoot girls dancin' in the moonlight. I can hear the bull frog callin' me.
Wonder if my rope's still hangin' to the tree.
Love to kick my feet way down the shallow water, 
shoe fly, dragon fly, get back t your mother.
Pick up a flat rock, skip it across Green River. Up at Cody's camp I spent my days, oh,
with flat car riders and cross-tie walkers.
Old Cody, Junior took me over,
said, you're gonna find the world is smould rin
an' if you get lost come on home to Green River. Long as I remember
The rain been comin' down
Clouds of mystery pourin'
Confusion on the ground Good men through the ages
Tryin' to find the sun
And I wonder, still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain? I went down Virginia
Seekin' shelter from the storm
Caught up in the fable
I watched the tower grow Five years plans and new deals
Wrapped in golden chains
And I wonder, still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain? Heard the singers playin'
How we cheered for more
The crowd had rushed together
They're tryin' to keep warm Still the rain kept pourin'
Fallin' on my ears
And I wonder, still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain? This train left the station
Quarter past midnight
A hundred souls taking their last ride
Each of them a traveler
Drifting through this life
Silent shadows passing in the night
Ride, ride, ride train of fools One will take his journey
With eyes that cannot see
Nothing's gonna get to him today
One will use her beauty
And take just what she please
She'll lose it all when beauty fades away
Ride, ride, ride train of fools
Ride, ride, ride train of fools One will be a rich man
At least that's what he'll say
Waste his life chasing after gold
One will be addicted
Chained to the devil's cross
That one's gonna die before he's old
Ride, ride, ride train of fools This one is a victim
A lost and broken child
Soon enough he'll be a man to hate
And those that point the finger
Will also share the blame
No one leaves this train judgement day
Ride, ride, ride train of fools
Ride, ride, ride train of fools Heaven's just a sin away, oh, oh, just a sin away
I can't wait another day, I think I'm giving in
How I love to hold you tight, oh, oh, be with you tonight
That still won't make it right 'cause you belong to him Oh, way down deep inside I know that it's all wrong
Your eyes keep tempting me and I never was that strong Devil's got me now, oh, oh, gone and got me now
I can't fight him anyhow, I think he's gonna win
Heaven's just a sin away, oh, oh, just a sin away
Heaven help me when I say I think I'm giving in Oh, way down deep inside I know that it's all wrong
Your eyes keep tempting me and I never was that strong Devil's got me now, oh, oh, gone and got me now
I can't fight him anyhow, I think he's gonna win
Heaven's just a sin away, oh, oh, just a sin away
Heaven help me when I say I think I'm giving in Heaven's just a sin away, oh, oh, just a sin away
I can't wait another day, I think I'm giving in
How I love to hold you tight, oh, oh, be with you tonight
That still won't make it right 'cause you belong to him I've been cheated, been mistreated
When will I be loved?
I've been pushed down, I've been pushed 'round
When will I be loved? When I find a new girl that I want for mine
She always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time I've been made blue, I've been lied to
When will I be loved? Oh man, I just wanna know when
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about When I find a new girl that I want for mine
She always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time, oh whoa I've been cheated, been mistreated
When will I be loved?
When will I be loved?
Tell me, when will I be loved? Met myself a comin' county welfare line.
I was feelin' strung out, hung out on the line.
Saw myself a goin', down to war in June.
All I want, all I want is to write myself a tune.
Wrote a song for everyone,
Wrote a song for truth.
And I couldn't even talk to you.
Got myself arrested, wound me up in jail.
Richmond 'bout to blow up, communication failed.
If you see the answer, now's the time to say.
All I want, all I want is to get you down and pray.
Saw the people standin' thousand years in chains.
Somebody said it's different now, look, it's just the same.
Pharoah's spin the message, 'round and 'round the truth.
They could have saved a million people, how can I tell you? I just moved in my new house today
Moving was hot but I got squared away
When bells started ringing and chains rattled loud
I knew I'd moved in a haunted house Still I made up my mind to stay
Nothing was a gonna drive me away
When I seen something that gave me the creep
Had a one big eye and two big feet I stood right still and I did the freeze
The thing came strolling up to me
Made a noise with the feet sound like a drum
Saying don't be here when the morning comes Say yes, I'll be here when the morning comes
I'll be right here and I ain't gonna run
I bought this house and you know I'm boss
Ain't no hate gonna run me off In the kitchen my stove was a blazing hot
The coffee was a boiling in the pot
The grease had melted in my pan
I had a hunk of meat right in my hand From out of space there sat a man
On the hot stove with the pots and pans
Say that's hot, I began to shout
He drank a hot coffee right from the spout He ate the raw meat right from my hand
Drank the hot grease from the frying pan
He said to me, well you better run
And don't be here when the morning comes Say yes, I'll be here when the morning comes
I'll be right here and I ain't gonna run
I bought this house and you know I'm boss
Ain't no hate gonna run me off Hey, Tonight,
Gonna be tonight,
Don't you know I'm flyin'
Tonight, tonight.
Hey, c'mon,
Gonna chase tomorrow
Tonight, tonight. Gonna get it to the rafters,
Watch me now.
Jody's gonna get religion
All night long. Hey, c'mon,
Gonna hear the sun
Tonight, tonight. Gonna get it to the rafters,
Watch me now.
Jody's gonna get religion
All night long. Aaaah!
Hey, Tonight,
Gonna be tonight,
Don't you know I'm flyin'
Tonight, tonight.
Tonight, tonight Whoa, thought it was a nightmare
Lo, it all so true
They told me, don't go walkin' slow
The devil's on the loose Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Whoa, don't look back to see Thought I heard a rumblin'
Callin' to my name
Two hundred million guns are loaded
Satan cries, "Take aim" Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Whoa, don't look back to see Over up on the mountain
Thunder magic spoke
"Let the people know my wisdom
Fill the land with smoke" Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Whoa, don't look back to see Seven Thirty Seven comin' out of the sky
Won't you take me down to Memphis on a midnight ride
I wanna move Playin' in a travelin' band, yeah
Well, I'm flyin' 'cross the land, tryin' to get a hand
Playin' in a travelin' band Take me to the hotel, baggage gone, oh well
Come on, come on, won't you get me to the room
I wanna move Playin' in a travelin' band
Well, I'm flyin' 'cross the land, tryin' to get a hand
Playin' in a travelin' band Listen to the radio, talkin' 'bout the last show
Someone got excited, had to call the state militia
Wanna move Playin' in a travelin' band
Well, I'm flyin' 'cross the land, tryin' to get a hand
Playin' in a travelin' band Well here we come again on a Saturday night
With your fussin' and a fightin' won't you get me to the rhyme
I wanna move Playin' in a travelin' band
Well, I'm flyin' 'cross the land, tryin' to get a hand
Playin' in a travelin' band Well I'm playin' in a travelin' band
Playin' in a travelin' band
Won't you get me, take my hand
Well, I'm playin' in a travelin' band
Well, I'm flyin' 'cross the land
Tryin' to get a hand
Playin' in a travelin' band Left a good job in the city
Workin' for the man every night and day
And I never lost a minute of sleepin'
An' worryin' 'bout the way things might have been Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Pumped a lot of pain down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
Till I hitched a ride on the river boat Queen Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river Well if you come down to the river
Bet you gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry 'cause you have no money
People on the river are happy to give The big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Alright rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river Have Thine own way, Lord, have Thine own way,
Thou art the potter, I am the clay,
Mold me and make me, after Thy will,
While I am waiting, yielded and still.
Have Thine own way, Lord, have Thine own way,
Search me and try me, Master today,
Whiter than snow, Lord, wash me just now,
As in Thy presence humbly I bow. Have Thine own way, Lord, have Thine own way,
Wounded and weary, help me I pray,
Power, all power, surely is Thine,
Touch me and heal me, Saviour divine.
Have Thine own way, Lord, have Thine own
Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay. Put a candle in the window, 'cause I feel I've got to move.
Though I'm going, going, I'll be coming home soon,
'Long as I can see the light. Pack my bag and let's get moving, 'cause I'm bound to drift a while.
When I'm gone, gone, you don't have to worry long,
'Long as I can see the light. Guess I've got that old travelling bone, 'cause this feeling won't leave me alone.
But I won't, won't be losing my way, no, no
'Long as I can see the light. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Oh, Yeah! Put a candle in the window, 'cause I feel I've got to move.
Though I'm going, going, I'll be coming home soon,
Long as I can see the light.(5x) This old push-and-shovin' city life, lord, had really got me down.
I'm goin' back and leaving here tonight, get my feet on the ground. Chorus:
I'm goin back (back to the hills), I'm goin back (back to the hills),
Goin' back (back to the hills) tonight (back to the hills).
I'm goin back (back to the hills), I'm goin back (back to the hills),
Goin' back (back to the hills) tonight (back to the hills). My time is done for livin' on the run, and the money making schemes,
Feelin' success and takin' all the rest, empty hearts and shattered dreams. Chorus
Oo-oo-oooh!
Oo-oo-oooh! Back (I'm goin' back to the), back (I'm goin' back to the),
Back (I'm goin' back to the), tonight! (I'm goin' back to the)
Back (I'm goin' back to the), back (I'm goin' back to the),
Back (I'm goin' back to the), tonight! (I'm goin' back to the) Chorus Tell your pa I'm gonna leave it all, he won't be seeing me around,
And if you like, just come along tonight, get your feet on the ground. Chorus I'm goin' back! (I'm goin' back to the)... etc.

With a pool-stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo

White-trash version of Shania karaoke

Dabbing on three dollars
Worth of that bathroom Polo

On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go, she was running low on faith in gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going way to fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was sooo scared
She threw her hands up in the air Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this all on my own
Imma let it go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on Jesus take the wheel It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said I'm sorry for the way I've been living my life
I know I've got to change So from now on tonight
Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own Imma let it go
So give me one more chance

And told you that I loved you
And suppose I said I wanna come back home
And suppose I cried and said I think I finally learned my lesson
And I'm tired of spending all my time alone If I told you that I realize you're all I ever wanted
And it's killing me to be so far away
Would you tell me that you love me too
And would we cry together
Or would you simply laugh at me and say I told you so
Oh, I told you so
I told you someday you'd come crawling back
And asking me to take you in
I told you so
But you had to go
Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again If I got down on my knees and told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand
Would we get that old time feeling
Would we laugh and talk for hours
The way we did when our love first began Would you tell me that you missed me too
And that you've been so lonely
And you've waited for the day that I returned
And we would live and love forever
And that I'm your one and only
Or would you say the tables finally turn Would you say I told you so
Oh, I told you so
I told you someday you'd come crawling back
And asking me to take you in
I told you so
But you had to go
Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

My Savior, God, to Thee

With shouts of acclamation
And lead me home

With humble adoration
And then proclaim My God

Fear is crashing in

It's written in the stars that shine above
A world where you and I belong
Where faith and love will keep us strong
Exactly who we are is just enough
There's a place for us, there's a place for us Where the water meets the sky
Where your heart is free and hope comes back to life

There's a place for us Dry lightning cracks across the skies
Those storm clouds gather in her eyes
Her daddy was a mean old mister
Mama was an angel in the ground
The weatherman called for a twister
She prayed blow it down
There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past
Shatter every window till it's all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
Till there's nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
(Blown away) She heard the sirens screaming out
Her daddy laid there passed out on the couch
She locked herself in the cellar
Listened to the screaming of the wind Some people called the take-in shelter
She called a sweet revenge
Shatter every window till it's all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
Till there's nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past
Shatter every window till it's all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
Till there's nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away
Blown away
Blown away
Blown away
Blown away Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Since the day they got married
He'd been praying for a little baby boy
Someone he could take fishing
Throw the football, be his pride and joy
He could already see him holding that trophy
Taking his team to state
But when the nurse came in with a little pink blanket
All those big dreams changed And now, he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet, little, beautiful, wonderful, perfect
All-American girl Sixteen short years later
She was falling for the senior football star
Before you knew it he was dropping passes
Skipping practice just to spend more time with her The coach said, "Hey, son, what's your problem
Tell me have you lost your mind?
Daddy said you'll lose your free ride to college.
Boy, you better tell her goodbye." But now, he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet, little, beautiful, wonderful, perfect
All-American And when they got married and decided to have one of their own
She said, "Be honest, tell me what you want?"
And he said, "Honey, you ought to know... A sweet, little, beautiful one just-a like you.
I want a beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American..." Now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet, little, beautiful, wonderful, perfect
All-American girl All-American girl Little boy, six years old
A little too used to being alone
Another new mom and dad, another school
Another house that'll never be home When people ask him how he likes this place
He looks up and says with a smile upon his face This is my temporary home
It's not where I belong
Windows and rooms that I'm passing through
This is just a stop on the way to where I'm going I'm not afraid because I know
This is my temporary home
Mmmmm
Young mom on her own She needs a little help, got no where to go
She's looking for a job, looking for a way out 'Cause a half-way house will never be a home
At night she whispers to her baby girl
Someday we'll find our place here in this world
This is our temporary home It's not where we belong
Windows and rooms that we're passing through
This is just a stop on the way to where we're going
I'm not afraid because I know This is our temporary home
Old man, hospital bed
The room is filled with people he loves
And he whispers, "don't cry for me
I'll see you all someday"
He looks up and says
"I can see God's face"
This is my temporary home
It's not where I belong
Windows and rooms that I'm passing through
This was just a stop on the way to where I'm going
I'm not afraid because I know
This was my temporary home
Mmmmm
This is our temporary home She's a small-town, hard-working woman just trying to make a living
Working three jobs, feeding four little mouths in a run-down kitchen
When you never taking nothing and doing nothing but giving
It's hard to be a good wife and a good mom and a good Christian She said, "I don't drink"
"But sometimes I need a stiff drink"
"Sipping from a highball glass"
"Let the world fade away"
She said, "I don't smoke"
"But sometimes I need a long drag"
"Yeah, I know it might sound bad"
"But sometimes I need a smoke break" He's a big-city, hard-working man just trying to climb the ladder
First generation to go to college instead of driving a tractor
Never had nothing handed to him on a silver platter
It's hard to be a good man, good son, do something good that matters He said, "I don't drink"
"But sometimes I wanna pop that top"
"Take a swig and make the world stop"
"And watch it fade away"
He said, "I don't smoke"
"But sometimes I wanna light it up"
"Yeah, when things get tough"
"Sometimes I need a smoke break, yeah" So here's to you and here's to when the day gets long
Go ahead, I understand if you wanna take a load off I don't drink
But sometimes I need a stiff drink
Sipping from a highball glass
Let the world fade away
Yeah, and I don't smoke
But sometimes I need a long drag
Yeah, I know it might sound bad
But sometimes I need a, sometimes I need a... When the day gets long
When the work's all done
When the sun sets, when you need to forget
Grab that cup, mmm
Fill it up
Sip it slow and let it all go oh...
Said goodbye, turned around
And you were gone, gone, gone
Faded into the setting sun
Slipped away
But I won't cry
Cause I know I'll never be lonely
For you are the stars to me You are the light I follow
I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh Till I see you again
I can hear those echoes in the wind at night
Calling me back in time
Back to you
In a place far away
Where the water meets the sky
The thought of it makes me smile You are my tomorrow
I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh Till I see you again
Sometimes I feel my heart is breaking
But I stay strong and I hold on cause I know
I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends I will carry you with me, yeah yeah
I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
Till I see you again
Till I see you again
Till I see you again
Said goodbye turned around
And you were gone, gone, gone. It was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen
All dressed in white
Going to the church that night
She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
Sixpence in a shoe, something borrowed, something blue
And when the church doors opened up wide She put her veil down
Trying to hide the tears
Oh, she just couldn't believe it
She heard the trumpets from the military band
And the flowers fell out of her hands Baby why'd you leave me
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, "He's not coming home now."
This can't be happening to me This is just a dream The preacher man said, "Let us bow our heads and pray.
Lord please lift his soul, and heal this hurt."
Then the congregation all stood up and sang the saddest song that she ever heard
Then they handed her a folded up flag
And she held on to all she had left of him
Oh, and what could have been And then the guns rang one last shot
And it felt like a bullet in her heart Baby, why'd you leave me
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background Everybody's saying, "He's not coming home now."
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream Oou oh Baby, why'd you leave me
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
Oh, I'll never know
It's like I'm looking from a distance Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, "He's not coming home now."
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream
Oh oooh this is just a dream
Just a dream
Yeah, yeah Jenny grew up wild, like a blackfoot daisy
Out in the shack with a blue tick hound
Broke as hell, but blessed with beauty
The kind that a rich man can't turn down
She caught the eye of an oil man dancing
One summer night in a dime store dress
She had the looks, he had the mansion
And you can figure out the rest It was all roses, dripping in diamonds
Sipping on champagne
She was all uptown, wearing that white gown
Taking his last name She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
And up in the loft, that whole choir's singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they're ringing Jenny was hosting Junior League parties
And having dinner at the country club
Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie
But Ken was always getting way too drunk
Saturday night, after a few too many
He came home ready to fight
And all his money could never save Jenny
From the devil living in his eyes It was all bruises, covered in makeup
Dark sunglasses
And that next morning, sitting in the back pew
Praying with the baptist She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
And up in the loft, that whole singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
You just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they're ringing Jenny slipped something in his Tennessee whiskey
No law man was ever gonna find
And how he died is still a mystery
But he hit a woman for the very last time
She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
Standing there in a black dress singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they're ringing He said I've been where you've been before
Down every hallway's a slamming door
No way out, no one to come and save me
Wasting a life that the Good Lord gave you
There's somebody saying what I'm saying to you
Open my eyes and told me truth
He said: just a little faith and it'll all get better
So I followed that preacher man down to the river
And now I'm changed
And now I'm stronger There must've been something in the water
Oh there must've been something in the water Well I heard what he said and I went on my way
Didn't think about it for a couple of days
Then it hit me like a lightning late one night
I was all out of hoping, all out of fight
Couldn't fight back my tears so I fell on my knees
Saying God if you're there come and rescue me
Fell all pouring down from my dress
Gotta wash in the water, wash in the blur
And now I'm changed
And now I'm stronger There must've been something in the water
Oh there must've been something in the water And now I'm singing all along to amazing race
Can't nobody wipe this smile off my face
Got joy in my heart, angels on my side
Thinking about it, I saw the heart and looked their head
No turning back, leave everyday, give it all that I have
Trusted someone bigger than me
Ever since the day that I believed I am changed And now I'm stronger There must be been something in the water
Oh there must be something in the water
Oh there must be something in the water
Oh there must be something in the water
Oh yeah I'm stronger
Stronger I'm free You better take it from me,
that boy is like a disease.
You're running and trying, and trying to hide and you're wonderin' why you can't get free.
He's like a curse, he's like a drug. You'll get addicted to his love.
You wanna get out, but he's holdin' you down,
'cause you can't live without one more touch.
He's a good time cowboy casanova, leanin' up against the record machine.
He looks like a cool drink of water,
but he's candy-coated misery.
He's the Devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes, and he only comes out at night.
Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight, you better run for your life.
(Oh, oh. x3)
I see that look on your face, you ain't hearin' what I say. So I'll say it again, 'cause I've been where you've been,
and I know how it ends.
You can't get away.
Don't even look in his eyes, he'll tell you nothin' but lies, You wanna believe, but you won't be deceived if you listen to me and take my advice.
He's a good time cowboy casanova leanin' up against the record machine.
Looks like a cool drink of water but he's candy-coated misery.
He's the Devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes, and he only comes out at night. Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight, you better run for your life.
Run, run away, don't let him mess with your mind.
He'll tell you anything you wanna hear.
He'll break your heart, it's just a matter of time. But just remember, he's a good time cowboy casanova,
leanin' up against the record machine.
Looks like a cool drink of water but he's candy-coated misery.
He's the Devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes,
and he only comes out at night.
Gives you feelings that you don't wanna fight, you better run for your life.
Oh, you better run for your life.
Oh, you better run for your life. Ever ever after Storybook endings, fairy tales coming true
Deep down inside we want to believe they still do
And a secret is taught, it's our favorite part of the story
Let's just admit we all want to make it too Ever ever after
If we just don't get it our own way
Ever ever after
It may only be a wish away Starting your fashion, wear your heart on your sleeve
Sometimes you reach what's real just by making believe
Unafraid, unashamed
There is joy to be claimed in this world
You even might wind up being glad to be you Ever ever after
Though the world will tell you it's not smart
Ever ever after
The world can be yours if you let your heart
Believe in ever after No wonder your heart feels it's flying
Your head feels it's spinning
Each happy ending's a brand new beginning
Let yourself be enchanted, you just might break through To ever ever after
Forever could even start today
Ever ever after
Maybe it's just one wish away
Your ever ever after
Ever, ever, ever after
I've been dreaming of a true love's kiss
Oh, for ever ever after What you got if you ain't got love?
The kind that you just wanna give away
It's okay to open up
Go ahead and let the light shine through I know it's hard on a rainy day
You wanna shut the world out
And just be left alone
But don't run out on your faith 'Cause sometimes that mountain you've been climbing
Is just a grain of sand
And what you've been out there searching for forever Is in your hands
And when you figure out
Love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else Seem so small It's so easy to get lost inside
A problem that seems so big at the time It's like a river that's so wide
It swallows you whole
While you're sitting 'round thinking 'bout what you can't change
And worrying about all the wrong things Time's flying by, moving so fast
You better make it count 'cause you can't get it back
Sometimes that mountain you've been climbing
Is just a grain of sand And what you've been out there searching for forever
Is in your hands
Oh, and when you figure out
Love is all that matters after all It sure makes everything else
Seem so small
Sometimes that mountain you've been climbing
Is just a grain of sand
And what you've been out there searching for forever
Is in your hands
And then you figure out
Love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else
Oh, it sure makes everything else
Seem so small Looks like an angel, so picturesque
Like she walked right out of the wild, wild west
She's a devil in a satin dress
You don't even know her hair trigger's aimin' right at your chest
By the time you figure out that she gave you the runaround You won't know where she's at
She's a tumbleweed blowin' in the wind come sundown
Call a girl like that
Renegade runaway She's a sure shot, knock the ash off a smokin' cigarette

You'll see her name, alive or dead Yeah they'll take her either way cause she's wanted

That she's ridin' off out into the sunset
With her long hair flyin' 'cross the desert dirt

And I know you know better than to call me
Let's just hide out under the covers
One more secret between two old lovers
What can it hurt? I ain't hung up on you
I ain't in love with you
This is just time that I'm wasting
One or two little sips
I'm alright, I can quit
You're just some wine that I'm tasting I don't have to have you
I don't need to need you
Just a high that I'm chasing
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse I know I said, I said it was over
But it's hard when I miss you to stay sober
So if I show up here at your door again
Oh, it's just me falling off of the wagon
What can it hurt? I ain't hung up on you
I ain't in love with you
This is just time that I'm wasting
One or two little sips
I'm alright, I can quit
You're just some wine that I'm tasting I don't have to have you
I don't need to need you
Just a high that I'm chasing
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse I can quit when I'm ready (I can quit)
I ain't hurting nobody but me I ain't hung up on you
I ain't in love with you
This is just time that I'm wasting
One or two little sips
I'm alright, I can quit
You're just some wine that I'm tasting I don't have to have you
I don't need to need you
Just a high that I'm chasing
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse
Oh, no
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse Standing at the back door she tried to make it fast
One tear hit the hard wood it fell like broken glass
She said, "Sometimes love slips away
And you just can't get it back, let's face it" For one split second, she almost turned around
But that would be like pouring rain drops back into a cloud
So she took another step and said
"I see the way out and I'm gonna' take it" I don't wanna spend my life jaded, waiting
To wake up one day and find
That I've let all these years go by wasted Another glass of whiskey but it still don't kill the pain
So he stumbles to the sink and pours it down the drain
He says, "It's time to be a man and stop living for yesterday
Gotta face it" 'Cause I don't wanna spend my life jaded, waiting
To wake up one day and find
That I've let all these years go by wasted Oh I don't wanna keep on wishing, missing
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain't spending no more time wasted She kept drivin' along
'Til the moon and the sun were floating side-by-side
He looked in the mirror and his eyes were clear
For the first time in a while, yeah yeah Oh, I don't wanna spend my life jaded, waiting
To wake up one day and find
That I've let all these years go by wasted Oh I don't wanna keep on wishing, missing
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain't spending no more time wasted Oh I don't wanna spend my life jaded, waiting
To wake up one day and find
That I've let all these years go by wasted, yeah, yeah Oh I don't wanna keep on wishing, missing
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain't spending no more time wasted Last night,

There was something in your eyes and it wasn't right
I should've walked, but I never had the chance
Everything got out of hand, and I let it slide Now I only have myself to blame
For falling for your stupid games
I wish my life could be the way

Headlights shining bright in the middle of the day
One is for his wife
The other for the woman who loved him at night
Two black Cadillacs meeting for the first time And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn't bother to cry
Bye Bye, Bye Bye
Yeah they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He's not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye Two black cadillacs, two black cadillacs
Two months ago his wife called the number on his phone
Turns out he'd been lying to both of them for oh so long
They decided then he'd never get away with doing this to them Two black cadillacs waiting for the right time, right time
And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn't bother to cry
Bye Bye, Bye Bye
Yeah they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He's not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye Yeah yeah
It was the first and the last time they saw each other face to face
They shared a crimson smile and just walked away And left the secret at the grave
And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn't bother to cry
Bye Bye, Bye Bye
Yeah they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He's not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Eighteen years had come and gone
For Momma they flew by
But for me they drug on and on We were loadin' up that Chevy
Both tryin' not to cry
Momma kept on talkin', puttin' off goodbye
Then she took my hand and said
"Baby don't forget" "Before you hit the highway
You better stop for gas
And there's a fifty in the ashtray
In case you run short on cash" "Here's a map and here's a Bible
If you ever lose your way
Just one more thing before you leave
Don't forget to remember me" This downtown apartment
Sure makes me miss home
And those bills there on the counter
Keep tellin' me I'm on my own And just like every Sunday
I called Mama up last night
And even when it's not
I tell her everything's all right
Before we hung up I said
"Hey Mama don't forget" "To tell my baby sister
I'll see her in the fall
And tell Mee-Mal that I miss her
Yeah I should give her a call" "And make sure you tell daddy
That I'm still his little girl
Yeah I still feel like I'm where I'm supposed to be
But don't forget to remember me" Tonight I find myself kneelin' by the bed to pray
I haven't done this in a while
So I don't know what to say But Lord I feel so small sometimes
In this big old place
Yeah I know there's more important things
But don't forget to remember me
Don't forget to remember me In between the coats in the closet
She held on to that heart-shaped locket
Starin' at a family, flawless
But it ain't a pretty picture tonight Mom and daddy just won't stop it
Fightin' at the drop of a faucet
Cuts through the walls, catastrophic
She's caught in the crossfire Puts her hands over her ears
Starts talkin' through the tears
And she's sayin', and she's prayin' I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurting no one
Just a bang, bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang, bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns) Wish there was a white flag wavin'
Or that they were both just fakin'
And it was just a game they were playin'
Like shoot-'em-up cowboys Leave the plastic pistols in the front yard
Throw away the scorecard
And just turn off all the noise I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurtin' no one
Just a bang, bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words like were little toy guns)
And just a bang, bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns) Toy guns Oh, I wish they didn't cut like a knife
I wish they didn't break you inside
I wish they didn't bang, bang
Make you wanna run... Yeah, like little toy guns
No sting, no hurtin' no one
Just a bang, bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No shot from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang, bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Toy guns Oh, like little toy guns That lipstick on your collar, well, it ain't my shade of pink
And I can tell by the smell of that perfume, it's like forty dollars too cheap
And there's a little wine stain on the pocket of your white cotton thread
You drink beer and whiskey, boy, and you know I don't drink red Found it over in the corner
Wadded up on the bedroom floor
You shoulda hid it in the closet
You shoulda burned it, you shoulda lost it Now I'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry

I felt a revelation coming around
I guess it's right, it's so amazing
Every time I see you I'm alive You're all I've got
You lift me up
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathing in, a soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven When we touch
When we love
The stars light up
The wrong becomes undone Naturally
My soul surrenders
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathing in, a soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven When minutes turn to days and years
If mountains fall, I'll still be here
Holding you until the day I die I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
(And I wanna be inside in your heaven)
I wanna be inside
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathing in, a soothing wind
I wanna be inside your heaven I set out on a narrow way
Many years ago
Hoping I would find true love
Along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
Couldn't see how every sign
Pointed straight to you Every long lost dream
Led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart
They were like northern stars
Pointing me on my way
Into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to I think about the years I spent
Just passing through
I'd like to have the time I lost
And give it back to you
But you just smiled and take my hand
You've been there you understand
It's all part of a grander plan
That is coming true Every long lost dream
Led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart
They were like northern stars
Pointing me on my way
Into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to Now I'm just rolling home
Into my lover's arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That lead me straight to you
That God blessed the broken road
That lead me straight to you
ooooh Said the night wind to the little lamb
Do you see what I see
Way up in the sky little lamb
Do you see what I see
A star, a star
Dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite
With a tail as big as a kite Said the little lamb to the shepard boy
Do you hear what I hear
(Do You Hear What I Hear)
Ringing through the sky shepard boy
Do you hear what I hear
(Do hear What i hear)
A song, a song
High above the trees
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea Said the shepard boy to the mighty king
Do you know what I know 
(Do You Know What I Know) In your palace wall mighty king
Do you know what I know
(Do You Know What I Know)
A child, a child
Shivers in the cold
Let us bring him silver and gold
Let us bring him silver and gold Said the king to the people everywhere
Listen to what I say
(Listen to what I say)
Pray for peace people everywhere
Listen to what I say
(Listen to what I Say)
The child, the child
Sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light He will bring us goodness and light I was sitting on my doorstep
I hung up the phone and it fell out of my hand
But I knew I had to do it
And he wouldn't understand So hard to see myself without him
I felt a piece of my heart break
But when you're standing at a crossroad
There's a choice you gotta make I guess it's gonna have to hurt
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved
To get to the other side I guess it's gonna break me down
Like fallin' when you try to fly
Sad but sometimes
Moving on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye I know there's a blue horizon
Somewhere up ahead, just waiting for me
Getting there means leaving things behind
Sometimes life's so bitter sweet I guess it's gonna have to hurt
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved
To get to the other side I guess it's gonna break me down
Like fallin' when you try to fly
It's sad but sometimes
Moving on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye Time heals the wounds that you feel
Somehow, right now I guess it's gonna have to hurt
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved
To get to the other side I guess it's gonna break me down
Like fallin' when you try to fly
It's sad but sometimes
Moving on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved
To get to the other side Start to wave goodbye
Like fallin' when you try to fly
It's sad but sometimes
Moving on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na, yeah I love it when we're at a party
In a downtown crowd, oh
But I can't hear you call me baby
With the music up loud
Red wine, good times
No, I don't mind being with everyone else
And then there's nights like tonight that I
I want you to myself And tonight I wanna drive so far
We'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights
And I love the way you look in the firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket choir in the background
Underneath the harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat Oh, and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat I wanna feel it like a kick drum
Beating faster in your chest
I wanna feel you holding onto me
And make me hold my breath
You pull me closer, my head on your shoulder
Baby, we won't need a song
We'll make a falling star wish
One more slow kiss
What are we waiting on?
And tonight I wanna drive so far
We'll only find static on the radio. Ooooh
And we can't see those city lights
And I love the way you look in the firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket choir in the background
Underneath the harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Yeah, we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat I wanna feel it like a kick drum
Beating faster in your chest And tonight I wanna drive so far
We'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights
And I love the way you look in the firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
With a river rolling in the background
Underneath the harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
And we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat, oh Heard you laughing
In a crowd outside a restaurant we used to go to
I caught glimpse that stopped me in my tracks
It took me back
You looked happy
With that little girl up on your shoulders, happy I know where she got those crystal eyes of blue
Time's been sweet to you
As bad as it was
As bad as it hurts
I think God I didn't get what thought that I deserved Sometimes life leads down a different road When you're holding on the someone that you gotta let go
Someday you'll see the reason why
Sometimes, yeah sometimes
There's good in goodbye
I don't regret it
The time we had together
I won't forget it But we both ended up where we belong
I guess goodbye made us strong And yeah I'm happy
I found somebody too who makes me happy
And I knew one day I'd see you on the street
And it'd be bittersweet But as bad as it was
As bad as it hurts
I think God I didn't get what thought that I deserved Sometimes life leads down a different road
When you're holding on the someone that you gotta let go
Someday you'll see the reason why
Yeah sometimes, yeah sometimes
There's good in goodbye
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
As bad as it was
Yeah as bad as it hurt
I think God I didn't get what thought that I deserved
Sometimes life leads down a different road
When you're holding on the someone that you've got to let go
Someday you'll see the reason why
Yeah, someday you'll see the reason why
There's good in goodbye
Yeah, yeah
There's good in goodbye It's been a long and winding journey
But I'm finally here tonight
Picking up the pieces
And walking back into the light Into the sunset of your glory
Where my heart and future lies
There's nothing like that feeling
When I look into your eyes My dreams came true
When I found you
I found you
My miracle If you could see what I see
That you're the answer to my prayers
And if you could feel the tenderness I feel
You would know it would be clear that angels brought me here Brought me here
To be with you
I'll be forever grateful
Oh forever thankful My dreams came true
When I found you
My miracle
Oh If you could see what I see
That you're the answer to my prayers
And if you could feel the tenderness I feel
You would know it would be clear that angels brought me here
If you could feel the tenderness I feel
You would know it would be clear that angels brought me here Piercing words, eyes are red
Watched taillights in the rain
Empty heart filled with regret
I know we were both to blame And i'm not sorry that it's over
But for the way we let it end
So I said all I had to say
... In letters that I threw away
...
And you should know, please believe me
...
I've picked up the phone a thousand times And tried to dial your number, but it's been so long
...
It's never easy, it's like tryin spin the world the other way
... What can I say? ...
How did it come to this? I think about you all the time
It's no excuse, but I wish
That I never made you cry
I'm not sorry that it's over
But for the way we let it end
I couldn't find the words to say ...
And you should know, please believe me
...
I've picked up the phone a thousand times
And tried to dial your number, but it's been so long
... It's never easy, it's like tryin spin the world the other way
What can I say? What can I say?
...
What can I say? What can I say?
...
I hate to think all you had of me
(I said all I had to say)
Is a memory I left you, place between
what was meant to be
(In letters that I threw away)
And the mess that it turned into
And you should know, please believe me
...
I've picked up the phone a thousand times
And tried to dial your number, but it's been so long
...
It's never easy, it's like tryin spin the world the other way
...
What can I say? What can I say?
...
What can I say?
... Never was the kind to think about dressing in white
Wasn't waiting on a prince to come riding into my life
Thought I was happy on my own
'Til you came and proved me wrong I finally found what I never knew I always wanted
I couldn't see I was blind 'til my eyes were opened
I didn't know there was a hole
Something missing in my soul
'Til you filled it up with your love, yeah
(Yeah, yeah) Never pictured myself singing lullabies
Sitting in a rocking chair in the middle of the night
In the quiet, in the dark
You're stealing every bit of my heart with your daddy's eyes
What a sweet surprise And now I'm holdin' what I never knew I always wanted
I couldn't see; I was blind 'til my eyes were opened
I didn't know there was a hole
Something missing in my soul
'Til you filled it up, oh, with your love Life has a way of showing you just what you need
And who you were made to be, yeah I finally found what I never knew I always wanted
I couldn't see; I was blind 'til my eyes were opened
I didn't know there was a hole
Something missing in my soul
'Til you filled it up with your love
Yeah, you filled it up with your love, yeah
(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah) I never was the kind to think about dressing in white
I never pictured myself singing lullabies Red sun, saltwater dripping, haze
Stick-shift, summer Sahara, chains
We ain't alone Blue lights on the horizon
Dust clouds filling the sky
If they get the cuffs on us
It's 25 to life
Run, run, your own direction
And I'll lead 'em down a different road
Take the gun, hide the car and the money
I'll meet you in Mexico Look for the golden sombrero
Puerto Nuevo west
Blondes had a little too much fun
I'll be brunette
Adiós til then Blue lights on the horizon
Dust clouds filling the sky
If they get the cuffs on us
It's 25 to life
Run, run, your own direction
And I'll lead 'em down a different road
Take the gun, hide the car and the money
I'll meet you in Mexico Run, run, run Blue lights on the horizon
Dust clouds filling the sky
If they get the cuffs on us
It's 25 to life
Run, run, your own direction
And I'll lead 'em down a different road
Take the gun, hide the car and the money
I'll meet you in Mexico Crossing that border; passport says Jane Doe
For a little while, baby, just lay low
Oh oh oh, I'll meet you in Mexico
Suntan, seaside, feeling that breeze blow
We'll be sipping that smooth Don Julio
Oh oh oh, I'll meet you in Mexico, yeah You're gonna run out of cigarettes
And we're gonna run out of wine
We haven't even started the good stuff yet
It's OK, we've got plenty of time
So pull up a comfortable chair, baby
And put on those records that drive me crazy
You look so good in this light
Oh yeah, you look like nothing but mine I wanna love you like the world's gonna stop
Til the very last second, last tick of that clock
I'm gonna slow it all down and then take you from zero to ten
Oh, I wanna love you like I'll never love you again Let's make this night last forever
Like honey dripping sweet and slow
Every kiss just tasting better
Every touch, every whisper, let go I wanna love you like the world's gonna stop
Til the very last second, last tick of that clock
I'm gonna slow it all down and then take you from zero to ten
Yeah, I wanna love you like I'll never love you again
Ooh, yeah I wanna love you like the rain on a roof
Stronger than a bottle of 110 proof
I wanna take love to places that love has never been
Yeah, I wanna love you like I'll never love you again
And I'll love you again
Oh, and again! He is my Lord i obey him day and night i know that you might not agree with me but that is okay i just know that today i will worship i will pray i will make sure he hears me and that he knows i am here as well as he knows what your doing at this very moment and he is very close ya because i can hear the angel's calling they are lifting him up higher than ever i know that he will conquer he is Jesus my Lord Jesus Our Lord ohhhhhhhhhh Jesus hear me please forgive me please understand

We'd make out in a crowd somewhere
Somebody'd tell us to get a room
It's hard to believe that was me and you
Now we keep saying that we're okay
But I don't want to settle for good not great
I miss the way that it felt back then I wanna feel that way again Been so long that you'd forget the way I used to kiss your neck
Remind me, remind me
So on fire so in love. Way back when we couldn't get enough
Remind me, remind me Remember the airport dropping me off
We were kissing goodbye and we couldn't stop
I felt bad cause you missed your flight
But that meant we had one more night Do you remember how it used to be
We'd turn out the lights and we didn't just sleep
Remind me, baby, remind me
Oh, so on fire so in love
That look in your eyes that I miss so much
Remind me, baby, remind me I wanna feel that way
Yeah, I wanna hold you close
Oh, if you still love me
Don't just assume I know Baby, remind me, remind me Do you remember the way it felt?
You mean back when we couldn't control ourselves
Remind me
Yeah, remind me
All those things that you used to do
That made me fall in love with you
Remind me, oh, baby, remind me Yeah, you'd wake up in my old t-shirt
All those mornings I was late for work
Remind me Oh, baby, remind me Oh, baby, remind me, baby, remind me
Yeah, you'd wake up in my old t-shirt
Remind me, yeah, oh
Baby, remind me Whatcha gonna do when the show is over?
Whatcha gonna sing when the song ends?
Yeah, how you gonna cope when there is no closure?
Where you gonna reach when the goal gets higher?
How you gonna make it through when you think you lost your chance? Play on when you're losing the game
Play on, 'cause you're gonna make mistakes
It's always worth the sacrifice
Even when you think you're wrong
So play on, play on Even when the floodgates swing wide open
Never let current take you down, no
Even when you're not sure where you're going
Swimming through a mess and you can't get out
Just going through the motions and trying not to drown Play on when you're losing the game
Play on, 'cause you're gonna make mistakes
It's always worth the sacrifice
Even when you think you're wrong
So play on, play on Even through a storm on the darkest night
Don't you ever give up the fight
Even when you feel you're all alone
Play on, play on Play on when you're losing the game
Play on, 'cause you're gonna make mistakes
It's always worth the sacrifice
Even when you think you're wrong
So play on, play on Play on
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na There's some things that I regret
Some words I wish had gone unsaid
Some starts that had some better endings
Been some bad times I've been through
Damage I could not undo
Some things I wish I could do all all over again
But it don't really matter
When life gets that much harder
It makes you that much stronger
Oh
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned From every tear that had to fall from my eyes
From every day I wondered how I'd get through the night
From every change life has thrown me
I'm thankful for every break in my heart
I'm grateful for every scar
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned There's mistakes that I have made
Some chances I just threw away
Some roads I never should've taken
Been some signs I didn't see
Hearts that I hurt needlessly
Some wounds that I wish I could have one more chance to mend
But it don't make no difference
The past can't be rewritten
You get the life you're given
Oh
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned From every tear that had to fall from my eyes
From every day I wondered how I'd get through the night
From every change life has thrown me
I'm thankful for every break in my heart
I'm grateful for every scar
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned And all the things that break you
Are all the things that make you strong
You can't change the past 'cause it's gone
And you gotta just move on
Because it's all
Lessons learned From every tear that had to fall from my eyes
From every day I wondered how I'd get through the night
From every change life has thrown me
I'm thankful for every break in my heart
I'm grateful for every scar
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned
Oh
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned
Lessons learned Little princess, summer flowers in her hair
Playing Ring Around The Rosie in a picture there
Tiptoeing 'round the house in her mama's shoes
Coloring her lips red in her bedroom Prom queen wants to be like the magazines
Thinks she found her king, barely seventeen
Too much that the world's wanting you to do
When you're still just a child in your mama's shoes Little girl, little girl, don't grow up too fast
'Fore you know it, you'll be wishing you could just go back
Don't you know there'll be plenty of time for that
Somewhere down the road?
Yeah, it's all gonna fly in the blink of an eye
You can't slow down this thing called life
So take your time and let it last
Little girl, don't grow up too fast
Yeah, yeah Sometimes I feel like I'm hanging on by a thread
Climbing ladders trying to get to the next step
Working hard, always wanting something more
Missing how things were simple like it was before Cause it's hard to know just what to do
When I still feel like a child in my mama's shoes Little girl, little girl, don't grow up too fast
'Fore you know it, you'll be wishing you could just go back
Don't you know there'll be plenty of time for that
Somewhere down the road?
Yeah, it's all gonna fly in the blink of an eye
You can't slow down this thing called life
So take your time and let it last
Little girl, don't grow up too fast
Ooh, yeah Sometimes I wish I could just go back and say
"Take your time and let it last, little girl" Yeah, it's all gonna fly in the blink of an eye
You can't slow down this thing called life
So take your time and let it last
Little girl, don't grow up too fast
Little girl, don't grow up too fast
Yeah, yeah Sittin' up on the roof
Sneakin' a smoke by the chimney
Checkin' out the moon and the city lights
He takes off his flannel shirt
And he drapes it around her shoulders
Slides up behind her and holds on tight
And she says, "I don't want this night to end
Why does it have to end?" Tomorrow she'll be rollin' down I-10 Baton Rouge
LSU 18 years in her rear view
He's got a Friday paycheck lined up down the block
At daddy's shop, it ain't much but it's a job
They've been dreadin' this moment all summer long
The night before life goes on Ooh, a tear falls off her cheek and
Right when it hits his arm he says
"Come on baby, lets get outta here"
They take one last drive around town
And man it already looks different
He bangs the wheel and says
"Life ain't fair and this growin' up stuff man I don't know
I just don't wanna let you go" Tomorrow shell be rollin' down I-10 Baton Rouge
LSU 18 years in her rear view
He's got a Friday paycheck lined up down the block
At daddy's shop, it ain't much but it's a job
They've been dreadin' this moment all summer long
The night before life goes on Yeah, that's what my momma told me
And just like those kids
I didn't wanna listen to no one
Yeah, there's nothin' you can do
There's nothin' you can say
And I know how it feels when love goes away Tomorrow she'll be rollin' down I-10 Baton Rouge
LSU 18 years and hurry ya do
He's got a Friday paycheck lined up down the block
At daddy's shop, it ain't much but it's a job
They've been dreadin' this moment all summer long
But here it is they don't have long
The night before life goes on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah In between the coats in the closet
She held on to that heart-shaped locket
Starin' at a family, flawless
But it ain't a pretty picture tonight Mom and daddy just won't stop it
Fightin' at the drop of a faucet
Cuts through the walls, catastrophic
She's caught in the crossfire Puts her hands over her ears
Starts talkin' through the tears
And she's sayin', and she's prayin' I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurting no one
Just a bang, bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang, bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns) Wish there was a white flag wavin'
Or that they were both just fakin'
And it was just a game they were playin'
Like shoot-'em-up cowboys Leave the plastic pistols in the front yard
Throw away the scorecard
And just turn off all the noise I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurtin' no one
Just a bang, bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words like were little toy guns)
And just a bang, bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns) Toy guns Oh, I wish they didn't cut like a knife
I wish they didn't break you inside
I wish they didn't bang, bang
Make you wanna run... Yeah, like little toy guns
No sting, no hurtin' no one
Just a bang, bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No shot from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang, bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Toy guns Oh, like little toy guns Maybe it's the way that the stars are aligned
That's makin' me feel this way tonight
Maybe it's the words you left unsaid
Maybe it's the stardust in my head But I wanna tell ya
That my heart is busting at the seams, yeah and
I can't wait another minute
Life is short, love is sweet
Ain't no time like this time baby Maybe it's the way that the night is still
Or the sound of the rain on my windowsill
That's making all the pieces fit
Makin' it all make perfect sense But I wanna tell ya
That my heart is busting at the seams, yeah and
I can't wait another minute
Oh, life is short, love is sweet
Ain't no time like this time baby Ooh, yeah Goes by so fast
Can't get it back

Like this time Yeah, I just wanna tell ya
That my heart is busting at the seams, yeah and
I can't wait another minute

Ain't no time like this time baby My little baby Maybe it's the way that the stars are aligned
And there ain't no time
Ain't no time
Ain't no time
Like this time baby Ooh yeah
Maybe it's the way that the night is still
Or the sound of the rain on my windowsill, yeah, yeah That first cold September night
You were the blanket holding me tight
You were kissing me and the years stood still
You said we don't have to I said I will, yeah We ran in when the thunder came
You told me sugar melts in the rain
Don't want to watch our love go to waste
So we ran inside for it was too late
Oh I, Oh I'm not trying
Oh I, Oh I, but I can't stop smiling, yeah Do you think about me
Like I think about you
Do you think about me
Like I think about you I moved on to another town
Wrote you letters till the ink ran out
When the clouds rolled in
I grabbed the keys
And played that song that we used to sing
I met a boy a lot like you
It's funny how he used to sing it too
But he always just a little out of key
So much different than you and me
Oh I, Oh I'm not even trying
Oh I, Oh I but I can't stop smiling, yeah Do you think about me
Like I think about you
Do you think about me
Like I think about you
Oh, yeah Sometimes I wonder if you wonder
What it could have been like
When you're sitting there drinking coffee
Are you thinking of me
When it's thundering and raining outside
Oh I, oh I'm not even trying
Oh I, oh I but I can't stop smiling
Oh I, oh I, it's mystifying
Oh I, oh I but I can't stop smiling
Do you think about me
Like I think about you
Do you think about me
Like I think about you

HOO! Oh...
Well life's been kinda trippy down here in Mississippi
Since Cassie O'Grady disappeared
And me and Bobby Shaver, been in all the newspapers
Every day for now on a year.
They say we got tangled in a love triangle,
A fatal game of truth or dare...
But the truth remains a mystery and now it's ancient history
It's a Choctaw County Affair. It's just a Choctaw County Affair (Choctaw County Affair)
Oh people talkin' 'bout it everywhere (Choctaw County Affair) Well, Cassie O'Grady was no Southern 'lady',
Despite all the media hype.
They all loved to make her out like a 'sweet, little, devout,
all-American, cheerleader' type.
But her mum was Ketty Warper,
she was greedy, she was pompous,
strutting 'round with her nose in the air...
She was a cold, gold-digger,
tickle in her hand-shaker
It's a Choctaw County Affair It's just a Choctaw County Affair (Choctaw County Affair),
And now they say she's lyin' dead somewhere (Choctaw County Affair) Well I do not deny, I wished Cassie would die
When she threatened us with blackmail.
She said she had some information
that would wreck my reputation,
and land Bobby back in jail.
Now, it's best to remember Bobby Shaver's got a temper,
like a buck-shot Grizzly bear...
But there's no body, there's no witness,
so y'all go mind your business.
It's a Choctaw County Affair. It's just a Choctaw County Affair (Choctaw County Affair)
Oh, you mess with Bobby and you better beware! (Choctaw County Affair)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well the press went wild on the day of the trial,
when they put us on the witness stand.
They thought we'd turn on each other,
but soon they all discovered
we were live-or-die, hand-in-hand.
And that fancy DA from down Jackson way
Said he'd see us in the electric chair...
Ha! But the foreman of the jury
told me "Honey, don't you worry,
It's a Choctaw County Affair." Yeah.
(Choctaw County Affair) Hey yeah it's just a Choctaw County Affair, yeah, yeah, yeah!
(Choctaw County Affair) How would you know 'cause you weren't there.
Yeah it's just a Choctaw County Affair (Choctaw County Affair)
Mmm, yeah.
(Choctaw County Affair) This boy here wants to move too fast
He see's my future as having a past
Well, I don't think so
I don't think so That boy there, well he's playing a fool
He thinks he's funny and he thinks he's cool
We'll I don't think so
I don't think so Cheap date, bad taste another night gone to waste
Talking about nothing in so many words
It's not like I'm not trying
'Cause I'll give anyone a shot once And, I, I close my eyes
And, I kiss that frog
Each time finding
The more boys I meet the more I love my dog Here's this guy, thinks he's bad to the bone
He wants to pick me up and take me home
Well, I don't think so
I don't think so Cage fights, PlayStation, X-Games radier nation
Oversize pants with an ego to match
It's not like I'm not trying
'Cause I'll give anyone a shot once And, I, I close my eyes
And, I kiss that frog
Each time finding
The more boys I meet the more I love my dog Why can't they be like the one's that mean everything to me
Warm and loyal, open and friendly
It's not like I'm not trying 
'Cause I'll give anyone a shot once I close my eyes
And, I kiss that frog
Each time finding
The more boys I meet the more I love my I close my eyes
And, I kiss that frog
Each time finding
The more boys I meet the more I love my dog The more I love my dog Deserts grow cold
Rivers run dry
We give up on each other without thinking twice
Hope gets lost
Can't see the dawn
When the storm just won't let up, give us the faith to carry on
When we get scared
Let this be our prayer God keep us safe tonight
Keep our eyes toward the skies
Send down an army of angels
To make us brave
And keep us strong and unafraid
God keep us safe We walk a thousand steps in the wrong direction
Broken and bruised, wearing tattered shoes
Asking Him a thousand questions
But we go on
Trying to get back home
Through the struggles and the troubles I know we don't walk alone
Even when we get lost through the valleys we crossed God keep us safe, safe tonight
Keep our eyes toward the skies
Send down an army of angels
To make us brave
And keep us strong and unafraid
God keep us safe
God keep us safe Oh God keep us safe
Unafraid
And keep our eyes on the heavens and give us grace
Send us an army of angels
To make us brave
Keep us strong and unafraid
Keep us strong and unafraid
God keep us safe
Keep us safe Who are you
The one for whom I'd really gladly suffer
Who are you
The one I'll always love above another
You're my world, you're my hope, you're all my dreams and all my heart Who are you
The one I give my life to
Who are you
Who loves as deep as I do Who are you
Who takes me through the flood and through the fire
Who are you
Who leads me through the desert and the dry
You're in my thoughts, you know my mind
You are my fate, you are my light Who are you
The one I give my life to
Who are you
Who loves as deep as I do You're my savior, you're my center
My beginning and my end
You're the one I live for, you're my angel
Who are you
You're in my thoughts (in my thoughts)
You know my mind (you know my mind)
You are my fate, you are my light Who are you
The one I give my life to
Who are you
Who loves as deep as I do
Who are you
Who fell on me like fire
Who are you
Who takes me through desire
Who are you
The one I give my life to. O holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the Soul felt it's worth A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees, oh, hear the angel voices
O night divine, o night when Christ was born
O night, o night, o night divine
O night, o night, o night divine O holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the Soul felt it's worth A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees, oh, hear the angel voices
O night divine, o night when Christ was born
O night divine, o night, o night divine I know you don't mean to be, mean to me
'Cause when you want to you can make me feel like we belong
We belong Lately, you make me feel all I am is a backup plan
I'll say I'm done and then you smile at me and I'll forget
Everything I said... I buy into those eyes and into your lies CHORUS 
You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll call, but I know you won't.
You say you'll call, but I know you won't. I wish you were where you're supposed to be
Close to me
But here I am just staring at this candle burning out
Still no sound Of footsteps on my stairs
Your voice anywhere CHORUS  You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll call, but I know you won't.
You say you'll call, but I know you won't. You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll call, but I know you won't.
You say you'll call, but I know you won't. You say you'll call, but I know you won't. Hello you long shots
You dark horse runners
Hairbrush singers, dashboard drummers
Hello you wild magnolias
Just waiting to bloom There's a little bit of all that inside of me and you
Thank God even crazy dreams come true I stood at the bottom of some walls I thought I couldn't climb
I felt like Cinderella at the ball just running out of time
So I know how it feels to be afraid
Think that it's all gonna slip away
Hold on, hold on Here's to you free souls, you firefly chasers
Street climbers, porch swingers, air guitar players
Here's to you fearless dancers, shaking walls in your bedrooms There's a lot of wonder left inside of me and you
Thank God even crazy dreams come true Never let a bad day be enough
To go and talk you in to giving up
Sometimes everybody feels like you
Oh, feels like you, just like you
Yeah I've met some go-getters
Some difference makers
Small town heroes and, big chance takers
I've met some young hearts with something to prove
Oh, yeah Here's to you long shots
You dark horse runners
Hairbrush singers, and dashboard drummers
Here's to you wild magnolias
Just waiting to bloom There's a little bit of all that inside of me and you
Thank God even crazy dreams come true
Thank God even crazy dreams come true
Yeah The hills are alive with the sound of music
With songs they have sung for a thousand years
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music My heart wants to sing every song it hears
My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
That rise from the lake to the trees My heart wants to sigh like a chime
That flies from a church on a breeze
To laugh like a brook when it trips And falls over stones on its way
To sing through the night
Like a lark who is learning to pray I go to the hills when my heart is lonely
I know I will hear what I heard before
My heart will be blessed with the sound of music
And I'll sing once more Got it all figured out inside of my head
There's a bag packed up at the foot of my bed
You say the word, baby, I'm all set We'll cover our tracks, tell a couple white lies
Make sure we got a good alibi
And by the time they catch on we'll be outta their sight
Long gone, baby Let's get out of this town tonight
Nothin' but dust in the shadows
Gone by mornin' light Somewhere we won't ever get caught
Ever be found
Baby, let's just get out of this town Don't need directions, don't need a map
If we get lost I'll be good with that
Yeah, we'll find a way to make the time pass Windows rolled down with the heat on high
Stars all aligned in a runaway sky
Holdin' my hand as the miles roll by
Long gone, baby Let's get out of this town tonight
Nothin' but dust in the shadows
Gone by mornin' light Somewhere we won't ever get caught
Ever be found
Baby, let's just get out of this town If we leave tonight and drive fast enough
All our troubles will be just like us
Long gone, baby Let's get out of this town tonight
Nothin' but dust in the shadows
Gone by mornin' light Somewhere we won't ever get caught
Ever be found
Yeah, let's get out of this town tonight Let's get out of this town tonight
Yeah, we won't ever get caught
Ever be found
Baby, let's just get out of this town Yesterday I got a call
Someone I didn't know at all passed away
Mama said yeah you know him
You went to school with both his kids
They lived out on Prescott lane
She said you should've seen the line
Mrs. Johnson said to tell you hi Thank God for hometowns
And all the love that makes you go round
Thank God for the country lines that welcome you back in
When you were dying to get out
Thank God for Church pews
And all the faces that won't forget you
Cause when you're lost in this crazy world
You got somewhere to go and get found
Thank God for hometowns
Yeah Last June my cousin tied the knot,
Didn't know if I'd go or not
But I'm sure glad I did
It was a pretty good haul but worth the drive
I could feel myself come back to life
The closer that I'd get
First red light I rollded the windows down
Breathed it in and took a look around Thank God for hometowns
First kisses and touchdowns
Thank God for the county lines that welcome you back in
When you were dying to get out
Thank God for Church pews
And all the faces that won't forget you
And when you're lost in this crazy world
You got somewhere to go and get found
Thank God for hometowns
Yeah I always find another piece of me
Walking down these old familiar streets Thank God for hometowns
And all the love that makes them go round
Thank God for the county lines that welcome you back in
When you were dying to get out
Thank God for Church pews
And all the faces that won't forget you
And when you're lost in this crazy world
You got somewhere to go and get found
Thank God for hometowns

Ray, a drop of golden sun
Me, a name I call myself
Far, a long long way to run
Sew, a needle pulling thread

Tea, a drink with jam and bread
That will bring us back to Do, oh oh oh Doe, a deer, a female deer

Me, a name I call myself

First man I see, gonna take him down
It ain't the Christian thing to do, they say
But someone, somewhere's gotta pay And if it wasn't for guys like you, there wouldn't be songs like this
And if you hadn't gone and done me wrong, I wouldn't go off like this
Yeah, even I'm surprised how easy sweet revenge rolls off my lips
If it wasn't for guys like you, there wouldn't be songs like this Broke my TV, pawned my guitar
After maxing out my credit cards
You lied much too much, and you lied again
Caught you on the couch with my best friend And if it wasn't for guys like you, there wouldn't be songs like this
And if you hadn't gone and done me wrong, I wouldn't go off like this
Yeah, even I'm surprised how easy sweet revenge rolls off my lips
If it wasn't for guys like you, there wouldn't be Songs like this one that

If it wasn't for guys like you, there wouldn't be songs like this No, if it wasn't for guys like you
There wouldn't be songs like this Front row center in that little white church
I was singing at a baby laying in a manger
Eight years old wearing angel wings
Yeah, and to this day, that's what you see I've been daddy's little girl since my first cry
And it was hard turning eighteen, saying goodbye
You told me I was gonna take the world by storm
And Mama said you cried all the way home You think I'm strong, you think I'm fearless
Even when I'm, I'm at my weakest
You always see the best in me when I can't
I wanna be the girl you think I am I got my flaws and I've got regrets
And I know there's more on the road ahead
When I wonder if I'll ever measure up
Oh, I thank God for a father's love Cause you think I'm brave, and you think I'm beautiful
You think that I can do the impossible
You always see the best in me when I can't
I wanna be the girl you think I am Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
The girl you think I am, yeah
Ooh
Ooh, yeah All I want, more than anything
Is to make you proud of me Cause you think I'm strong, and you think I'm fearless
Even when I'm, I'm at my weakest
You believe in me; yeah, you're my biggest fan
So I wanna be the girl you think I am
I wanna be the girl you think I am Love goes out, out like a light
Out like a flame, and you can't find it anymore
Just when you think it's lost in the rain
It comes back knocking at your door It's the wheel of the world turning around
It's the wheel of the world turning around
And around God put us here on this carnival ride
We close our eyes
Never knowing where it will take us next
Babies are born and at the same time, 
Someone's taking their last breath It's the wheel of the world
It's the wheel of the world turning around In the blink of an eye
It can change your life
And it never even slows down It's the wheel of the world I don't know what it is
I'm flying high
Then I'm wondering why I'm sinking on this ship, going down
Life keeps on moving anyway It's the wheel of the world
It's the wheel of the world turning around
It's the wheel of the world
It's the wheel of the world turning around
It's the wheel of the world turning around
And around
And around
It's the wheel of the world turning around It can open your heart
It can break you apart
And it never even slows down It's the wheel of the world turning around
It's the wheel of the world turning around
It's the wheel of the world turning around
It's the wheel of the world turning around
And around Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh, I yesterday came suddenly Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm One foot on the bus 'bout half past nine
I knew that you were leaving this time
I thought about laying down in its path
Thinking that you might get off for that I remember that night we laid in bed
Naming all our kids that we hadn't had yet
One for your grandma and one for mine
Said we'd draw straws when it came time I'll move on baby, just like you
When the desert floods and the grass turns blue
When a sailing ship don't need her moon
It'll break my heart, but I'll get through
Someday when I stop loving you I bet all I had on a thing called love
I guess in the end it wasn't enough
And it's hard to watch you leave right now
I'm gonna have to learn to let you go somehow
Somehow I'll move on baby, just like you
When the desert floods and the grass turns blue
When a sailing ship don't need her moon
It'll break my heart, but I'll get through
Someday when I stop loving you Ooh, oh someday
Oh someday I'll move on baby, just like you
When the desert floods and the grass turns blue
When a sailing ship don't need her moon
It'll break my heart, but I'll get through
Someday when I stop loving you
Someday when I stop loving you Whatcha gonna do with the 36 cents
Sticky with Coke on your floorboard
When a woman on the street is huddled in the cold
On a sidewalk vent trying to keep warm Do you call her over, hand her the change
Ask her story, ask her her name
Or do you tell yourself You're just a fool
Just a fool to believe you can change the world
You're just a fool
Just a fool to believe you can change the world Oh, whatcha gonna do when you're watching TV
And an ad comes on, yeah you know the kind
Flashing up pictures of a child in need
For a dime a day you could save a life Do you call the number, reach out a hand
Or do you change the channel, call it a scam
Or do you tell yourself You're just a fool
Just a fool to believe you can change the world
Don't listen to 'em when they say
You're just a fool
Just a fool to believe you can change the world Oh, the smallest thing can make all the difference
Love is alive, don't listen to 'em when they say
You're just a fool
Just a fool to believe you can change the world The world's so big it can break your heart
And you just want to help not sure where to start
So you close your eyes, and send up a prayer into the dark You're just a fool
Just a fool to believe you can change the world
Don't listen to 'em when they say
You're just a fool
Just a fool to believe you can change the world
Oh, the smallest thing can make all the difference
Love is alive, don't you listen to 'em when they say
You're just a fool
Just a fool to believe you can change the world Watching the night set in, tomorrow's a brand new day again
Full of twists and turns you'll never know, and great surprises
And nothing is black and white, with so many colors in this light
Take a brush and paint what's in your dreams, a perfect picture
I'm looking at my reflection, for the answer to the question
Make a wish tonight, and see the twinkle in the rain
There's magic if you close your eyes, so all you have to do is believe the impossible
And wish upon my magic mirror Believe in miracles, so dreamers always dream forever, forever
Possibilities in your hand, Adventures waiting far off land
Full of twists and turns you'll never know second chances
So catch a falling star, and keep it close hold it in you heart
And it will shine a light in the dark, and make things clearer
I'm looking at my reflection, for the answer to the question
Make a wish tonight, and see the twinkle in the rain there's magic if you close your eyes
So all you have to do is believe the impossible, and Wish upon my magic mirror Believe in miracles, so dreamers always dream forever, forever
Take a chance cuz you can and you will see all the possibilities
If you try you will find all the treasure hidden underneath your feet
Make a wish tonight, and see the twinkle in the rain
There's magic if you close your eyes, so all you have to do is believe the impossible
And wish upon my magic mirror Believe in miracles, so dreamers always dream forever, forever Last night
I was pouring out my heart like a waterfall to you
And with one kiss
I was a runaway train flying off the track to you "I love you" came flooding out
Couldn't make it stop, couldn't shut my mouth
Felt like a fool then I lied and said I was sorry, but I unapologize
I meant every word
Won't take back the way I feel about you
Can't unsay what you heard 'Cause you heard me right, and I won't try
To fight 'em back or hide my feelings for you
I unapologize You know
People say a lot of things that they don't really mean
And last night
I told a little white lie hoping you'd forget the scene Where it felt like a movie under that porch light
Couldn't help myself when you held me tight
Said what I meant then I lied and said I was sorry I unapologize
I meant every word
Won't take back the way I feel about you
Can't unsay what you heard 'Cause you heard me right, and I won't try
To fight 'em back or hide my feelings for you
I unapologize Oh, there's no time to be
Holding it all in trying to pretend
That I don't feel anything
Oh, I shouldn't have said I'm sorry I meant every word
Won't take back the way I feel about you
Can't unsay what you heard 'Cause you heard me right and I won't try
To fight 'em back or hide my feelings for you
I unapologize 'Cause you heard me right, yeah
'Cause you heard me right, yeah
'Cause you heard me right, yeah
'Cause you heard me right, yeah
'Cause you heard me right, yeah
I unapologize

Living my life in a slow hell
Different girl every night at the hotel
I ain't seen the sunshine in three damn days
Been fuelling up on cocaine and whisky
Wish I had a good girl to miss me
Oh Lord I wonder if I'll ever change my ways
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you
While I'm lying next to her
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her
I called you last night in the hotel
Everyone knows but they won't tell
But their half-hearted smiles tell me something just ain't right
I've been waiting on you for a long time
Fueling up on heartaches and cheap wine
I ain't heard from you in three damn nights
I put your picture away
I wonder where you been
I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him
I put your picture away
I wonder where you been
I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him
I saw you yesterday with an old friend
It was the same old same "How have you been?"
Since you've been gone my world's been dark and grey
You reminded me of brighter days
I hoped you were coming home to stay
I was headed to church
I was off to drink you away
I thought about you for a long time
Can't seem to get you off my mind
I can't understand why we're living life this way
I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you to come back home
I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you
To come back home
I just called to say I love you
Come back home
What Happen To Guns And Roses?

Singing songs about the Southland,

it was 1989
my thoughts were small my hair was long
caught somewhere between a boy and a man
she was barely seventeen and she was far from inbetween
it was summertime in southern michigan
splashing through the sand bar
talking by the camp fire
its the simple things in life like when and where
we didnt have no internet
but man i will never forget
the way the moon light shined in her hair
we were trying diffrent things
we were smoking silly things
making love out by the lake to our favorite song
sipping whiskey out the bottle
not thinking bout tommorow
singing sweet old alabama all summer long x2
catching walle from the dock
watching the waves roll of the rocks
shell forever hold a spot in my sole
wed blister in the sun
we couldnt wait for night to come to hit the sand and play rock and roll
while we were trying diffrent things we werre smoking funny things
making love out by the lake to our favorite song
drinking whiskey out the bottle
not thinking bout tommorow
singing sweet old alabama all night long x2
VERSE 1
I'm a pimp, you can check my stats
An' rollin' a Fleetwood, that's how I Mac
I rock all the tracks so the World knows
I love all the girls, smack all the Ho's
Show love to those who come real with it
Life's a bitch but I deal with it
I'm in it to win it like Yzerman
Can drink about fifteen Heinekens
I'm not born again, but if I was
I'd ask to come back with a little more love
Puffin' a Winston, drinkin' a 4-0
Kid Rockin' I'm-a letchya know
CHORUS (Female vocalists)
I been sittin' here just wastin' time
Drinkin', smokin', thinkin', tryin' to free my mind
I been sittin' here just wastin' time
Drinkin', smokin', tryin' to free my mind
VERSE 2
It's been a couple-a months in this smokey room
Eatin' shrooms, drinkin' Boone's
Writin' tunes, and hopin' to get
One-a these motherfuckin' songs to hit
A little bitta love that's all I need
A little inspiration, and a bagga weed
A seed to plant, so my tree can grow
You know I left my girl, cause I don't need that Ho-oooold up
Wait a minute, I'm about to flow
Like a breeze through the trees you can watch me blow
Puffin' a Winston, drinkin' a 4-0
Kid Rockin' I'm-a letchya know...
CHORUS (Female vocalists)
I been sittin' here just wastin' time
Drinkin', smokin', thinkin', tryin' to free my mind
I been sittin' here just wastin' time
Drinkin', smokin', tryin' to free my mind
MUSICAL BRIDGE (With female vocalist)
Oh yeah, oh-ho yeah
Free my my-yi-yi-yi-yind
oooo hooo yeah [Come on, uh uh] Yow!
VERSE 3
I ain't no rough guy, ain't no tough guy
Don't get out much, and don't dress up fly
A pawn in the game, that's all I am
Givin' all my duckets to Uncle Sam, fuck it
I'm free to do what I please little lady
I was born at night, but not last night baby
I been around, seen some things
I slep' in dumpsters, got high with Kings
I don't bring much, ain't got a lot to say
But I got more time than Morris Day
Puffin' a Winston, drinkin' a 4-0
Kid Rockin' I'm-a letchya know
CHORUS to Outro (Female vocalists)
I been sittin' here just wastin' time
Drinkin', smokin', thinkin', tryin' to free my mind (free my mind)
I been sittin' here just wastin' time
Drinkin', smokin', tryin' to free my mind (Smokin' and drinkin')
I been sittin' here just wastin' time
Drinkin', smokin', thinkin', tryin' to free my mind (try'na free my mind)
I been sittin' here just wastin' time
Drinkin', smokin', tryin' to free my mind
Way-aaastin' my time
Hey, I'm smokin'
Hey, I'm drinkin'
Tryin' to free my mind
I been sittin' here just wastin' time
Drinkin', smokin', tryin' to free-ee my my-yi-yi-yi-yind
If I was president of good old USA
You know I'd turn our churches into strip clubs
And watch the whole world pray
I'd give the working man back his money
I'd make the dirty fucking politicians pay
To all the women raising our children
I'd give 'em a vacation every year
To our good women raising our children
Give 'em a paid vacation every year
While all the good gals are relaxing
Us daddy's will be out looking at titties and drinking beer
If I was president even for just one day
Ya know I'd make the day Joe C passed away
One of our nation's new national holidays
If I was president I swear I'd get the job done
Ya know I'd uphold the freedom of speech, baby
And our rights to carry guns
I'd give my state of the union address
From a mile high smoking a joint on air force one
If I was president I wouldn't lie or sneak around
If I was president I would have sex in the oval office
Then lie about it all over town
I'd put TV cameras in the Lincoln bedroom
So the whole nation could watch Rock laying it down
And Monday night football on every TV
And Lynyrd Skynyrd on every radio
I'd give myself a pay raise
So the good folks in New York would never
Have to pay to see a Kid Rock show
I like good whiskey, I like fine ladies too
I've got off on a bad reputation billy
From running 'round with cats like you
I'm so glad to be back in New York City
For MTV's 20th playing for some of the best fans like you
Midnight riding in my old two seater rolling down the boulevard
Headlights shining on rusty fences as I pass the rail yard
Black leather jacket on a Friday night
Fire up the lighter and a lucky strike
The radio's saying "Take a walk on the wild side"
And it's got me feeling like...
Go, wide open, it's a pedal down kind of a thing
Little bit of Mo-Town smooth
A little bit of Memphis Blues
A sea of emotion raining all over me
Give me that heart and that soul
American rock 'n roll
I can see the banner on the courthouse flying proud red, white, and blue
I can see her waiving on the corner smiling cause she feels just like I do
Now she's sitting right next to me
Everything's how it oughta be
Being young in the land of the free
And she's got me feeling like...
Go, wide open, it's a pedal down kind of a thing
A little bit of Folsom Blues
A little bit of gangster smooth
A sea of emotion raining all over me
Give me that heart and that soul
American rock 'n roll
Midnight riding in my old two seater rolling down the boulevard
Headlights shining on rusty fences as I pass the rail yard
And it's got me feeling like...
And go, wide open, it's a pedal down kind of a thing
A little bit of Delta Blues
A little "Blue Suede Shoes"
A sea of emotion raining all over me
Give me that heart and that soul
American rock 'n roll
American rock 'n roll
American rock 'n roll
American rock 'n roll

Kid rock I got the sex rhymes
Kid rock I got the sex rhymes

All world class
Kid rock mother fucker yo I ain't no fag
I fuck bitches dry I fuck em on the rag
Tag their toes - check em off my list
Hoes get fucked - they don't get kissed
A simplistic pimp gettin much respect
I'll fuck your mouth and leave your ass in debt
Jet set the country on your world perks
Just to show you how a real pimp works
Remove your shirt - show me them titties
I'll drive my dick right through your twin cites
Around your bends over your curves and ass
Park it in your mouth till I run out of gas
Snoop dog I got the sex rhymes
Snoop dog I got the sex rhymes
Snoop dog I got the sex rhymes
All world class
It ain't nothing like black pussy on my dick
Word to your mama and your sister bitch
I play hoes like a mother fucking football game
I pull my dick out and you'll say it's good y'all came
Ya'll did y'all thing - worked a nigga front to back
In the bill clinton presidential cadillac
We smoked a sack - the bitches couldn't handle that
Blew out my brains and left no stain
I can't complain shit it's all done with game
I've fucked so many hoes I can't remember their name
But it ain't about that - bitch I really doubt that
Just turn the lights out and put my dick where yo mouth at
Kid rock I got the sex rhymes
Kid rock you got the sex rhymes
Snoop I got the presidential sex rhymes
My nigga
I'm on a private jet out of jfk
Sippin' the beck's - and feeling a okay
Looked across the aisle and who did I see
Bill motherfuckin' clinton sittin' next to me
We kicked it talked had a couple of laughs
The stewardess walked up and asked us for our autographs
I thought I was mackin' gave her two free shirts
Bill stuck five fingers up in her skirt
So, I stuck five and that made ten
Shit two roosters and only one hen
Billy winked at me - it was all too sweet
We tag teamed that freak at 30,000 feet
Yeah - 30,000 mother fuckin feet flying high
Kid rock beeped out?
And we thought we do's it the most on the coast
Shit we got the sex rhymes
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it
Let me see if you got some gangster shit homey
Cause if you do, I'm gunna kick something for you
A little something like this
Oh shit some gangster shit
All I need is a gangster bitch
If gangster shit is all I kick
I fucked with a black brown or a white chick
Bitch you can act like you ain't with the shit
I'm here to strip a bitch and cold pimp a bit
Lookin for love in all the wrong places
Lookin for love - fuck love it's too racists
Smokin it up in too many places
Bustin a nut in too many bitches faces
Well I'm kid rock
Got pussy galore
You might get a lot of pussy, I gets much more
Got scores of whores and macks knows what's up
You's a player
Nope I'm a flat out slut
Got what you came for - yes indeed
Ecstasy and a sea of weed
Got a seed to plant in your field of crap
I'll wear a cowboy hat and be your farmer jack
You can hold my sack while I pack your bag
You can rub my back while I tack a keg
One leg on the dash and one on the floor
I'll pop a cork in your ass and make you scream for more
Pissed off, pissed off
Money, hoes, tits and asses
We got the goods and the bullshit passes
We got whatever you need
I got ecstasy
I got pounds of weed
Money, hoes, tits and asses
We got the goods and the bullshit passes
We got whatever you need
I got ecstasy
I got pounds of weed
Let's do it
Should we do it
Can we do it
[Intro]
I can't help myself
Sugar pie, honey bunch
You know that I love you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else
In and out my life
You come and you go
Leaving just your picture behind
And I kissed it a thousand times
When you snap your finger or wink your eye
I come a-running to you
I'm tied to your apron strings
And there's nothing that I can do
I can't help myself
No, I can't help myself
Cause sugar pie, honey bunch
I'm weaker than a man should be
I can't help myself
I'm a fool in love you see
Wanna tell you I don't love you
Tell you that we're through
And I've tried
Every time I see your face
I get all choked up inside
When I call your name
Girl, it starts a flame
Burning in my heart, tearing it all apart
No matter how I try, my love I cannot hide
Cause sugar pie, honey bunch
You know that I'm waiting for you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else
Sugar pie, honey bunch
I'd do anything you ask me to
I can't help myself
I want you and nobody else
Sugar pie, honey bunch
You know that I love you
I can't help myself
No, I can't help myself

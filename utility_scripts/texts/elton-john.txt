Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Ohh, Bennie and the Jets It's a little bit funny
This feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
Don't have much money but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live If I was a sculptor
Ha
But then again no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you And you can tell everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind
While I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on So excuse me forgetting
But these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen And you can tell everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world She packed my bags last night pre-flight
Zero hour nine a.m.
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the earth so much, I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space on such a timeless flight And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no no no, I'm a rocket man
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no no no, I'm a rocket man
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them if you did
And all this science, I don't understand
It's just my job five days a week
A rocket man, a rocket man And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no no no, I'm a rocket man
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no no no, I'm a rocket man
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time Daniel is traveling tonight on a plane
I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain
Oh, and I can see Daniel waving goodbye
God, it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes They say Spain is pretty though I've never been
And Daniel says it's the best place that he's ever seen
Oh, and he should know, he's been there enough
God, I miss Daniel, oh I miss him so much, oh Daniel my brother you are older than me
Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal?
Your eyes have died but you see more than I
Daniel you're a star in the face of the sky Oh, Daniel my brother you are older than me
Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal?
Your eyes have died but you see more than I
Daniel you're a star in the face of the sky Daniel is traveling tonight on a plane
And I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain
Oh, and I can see Daniel waving goodbye
God, it looks like Daniel must be the clouds in my eyes
Oh God it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will Loveliness we've lost
These empty days without your smile
This torch we'll always carry
For our nation's golden child
And even though we try
The truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express
The joy you brought us through the years And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
Goodbye England's rose
From a country lost without your soul
Who'll miss the wings of your compassion
More than you'll ever know And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will You could never know what it's like
Your blood like winter freezes just like ice
And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use And did you think this fool could never win?
Well look at me, I'm a-coming back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standing, you just fade away Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind I'm still standing
(Yeah yeah yeah)
I'm still standing
(Yeah yeah yeah) Once I never could hope to win
You starting down the road leaving me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus you'd be a clown by now You know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind I'm still standing
(Yeah yeah yeah)
I'm still standing
(Yeah yeah yeah) Don't you know that I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind I'm still standing
(Yeah yeah yeah)

L.A. Lady, seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile
You'll marry a music man Ballerina, you must have seen her
Dancing in the sand
Now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand Jesus freaks, out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back, she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad Piano man he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on, she sings the songs
The words she knows, tune she hums But oh, how it feels so real
Lying here, with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly Hold me closer, Tiny Dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today Hold me closer, Tiny Dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today Blue Jean Baby

I won't (ah-ah...) go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart When are you gonna come down?
When are you going to land?
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singing the blues So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny back toad
Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road What do you think you'll do then
I bet that'll shoot down your plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny back toad
Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road There's a calm surrender
To the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling wind
Can be turned away
An enchanted moment
And it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior
Just to be with you And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight
How it's laid to rest?
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds Believe the very best There's a time for everyone
If they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope
Moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason To the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager Beats in time with yours
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight
How it's laid to rest?
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best I saw you dancin' out the ocean
Running fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flying from your hands In the instant that you love someone
In the second that the hammer hits
Reality runs up your spine
And the pieces finally fit And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Babe, you're the one There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel For each man in his time is Cain
Until he walks along the beach
And sees his future in the water
A long lost heart within his reach And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Ooh babe, you're the one And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Ooh babe, you're the one
And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Ooh babe, you're the one I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life Too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meaning when I met you
Close the door and left me blind by the light Don't let the sun go down on me
(don't let the sun)
Although I search myself it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment
(don't let the sun) of your life
To wander f-r-e-e...
By losing everything is like the sun going down on me I can't find oh the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have oh they need love to help them heal Don't let the sun go down on me
(don't let the sun)
Although I search myself it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment
(don't let the sun) of your life
To wander f-r-e-e... By losing everything is like the sun going down on me
Don't let the sun go down on me
(don't let the sun)
Although I search myself it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment
(don't let the sun) of your life
To wander f-r-e-e... yeah
By losing everything is like the sun going down on me Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind

Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong Into the boundary
Of each married man
Sweet deceit comes calling
And negativity lands Cold cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things look better baby
Just passing through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts living
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all Mutual misunderstanding
After the fact
Sensitivity builds a prison
In the final act We lose direction
No stone unturned
No tears to damn you
When jealousy burns Cold, cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate world
But, it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice, at all Cold, cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate world
But, it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice, at all No sacrifice, at all
No sacrifice, at all
No sacrifice, at all
No sacrifice, at all Don't wish it away
Don't look at it like it's forever
Between you and me
I could honestly say
That things can only get better And while I'm away
Dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long
Before you and me run
To the place in our hearts
Where we hide And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughing like children, living like lovers
Rolling like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues Just stare into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second
Without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man Wait on me girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever
I simply love you
More than I love life itself And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughing like children, living like lovers
Rolling like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues Wait on me girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever
I simply love you
More than I love life itself And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughing like children, living like lovers
Rolling like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues (Laughing like children, living like lovers)
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
(Laughing like children, living like lovers)
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
And I guess that's why they call it the blues When I think of those east end lights
Muggy nights the curtains drawn
In the little room downstairs
Prima donna Lord you really should have been there
Sittin' like a princess perched in her electric chair
And it's one more beer and I don't hear you anymore
We've all gone crazy lately
My friend's out there rolling 'round the basement floor
(ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...) And someone saved my life tonight
Sugar bear (sugar bear...) You almost had your hooks in me
Didn't you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar bound hypnotized sweet freedom
Whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away
High away
Bye bye
(ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...) Never realized the passing hours of evening showers
Slip noose hanging in my darkest dreams
I'm strangled by your haunted social scene
Just a pawn outplayed by a dominating queen
It's four o'clock in the morning
Damn it listen to me good
I'm sleeping with myself tonight
Saved in time
Thank God my music is still alive
(aah-aah-aah-aah-aah...) And someone saved my life tonight
Sugar bear
(sugar bear sugar bear...)
You almost had your hooks in me
Didn't you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar bound hypnotized sweet freedom
Whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away
High away
Bye bye
(ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) I would have walked head on into the deep end of the river
Clinging to your stocks and bonds
Paying your H.P. demands forever
Coming in the morning with a truck to take me home
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
So save your strength and run the field you play alone
And someone saved my life tonight
Sugar bear
(sugar bear sugar bear)
(sugar bear...)
You almost had your hooks in me
Didn't you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar bound
Hypnotized
Sweet freedom
Whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away
High away
Bye bye

AAAHHH! Levon wears his war wound like a crown
He calls his child Jesus
'Cause he likes the name
And he sends him to the finest school in town Levon Levon likes his money
He makes a lot they say
Spends his days counting
In a garage by the motorway He was born a pauper to a pawn on a Christmas Day
When the new york times said God is dead
And the war's begun
Alvin Tostig has a son today And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon Levon sells cartoon balloons in town
His family business thrives
Jesus blows up balloons all day
Sits on the porch swing watching them fly And Jesus he wants to go to Venus
Leave Levon far behind
Take a balloon and go sailing
While Levon Levon slowly dies He was born a pauper to a pawn on a Christmas Day
When the new york times said God is dead
And the war's begun
Alvin Tostig has a son today And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan, woo
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan, woo
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon I am here to tell you we can never meet again
Simple really, isn't it, a word or two and then
A lifetime of not knowing where or how or why or when
You think of me or speak of me or wonder what befell
The someone you once loved so long ago so well Never wonder what I'll feel as living shuffles by
You don't have to ask me and I need not reply
Every moment of my life from now until I die
I will think or dream of you and fail to understand
How a perfect love can be confounded out of hand Is it written in the stars
Are we paying for some crime
Is that all that we are good for
Just a stretch of mortal time Is this God's experiment
In which we have no say
In which we're given paradise
But only for a day Nothing can be altered, oh, there is nothing to decide
No escape, no change of heart, no any place to hide
You are all I'll ever want but this I am denied
Sometimes in my darkest thoughts, I wish I'd never learned
What it is to be in love and have that love returned Is it written in the stars
Are we paying for some crime
Is that all that we are good for
Just a stretch of mortal time Is this God's experiment
In which we have no say
In which we're given paradise
But only for a day Is it written in the stars
Are we paying for some crime
Is that all that we are good for
Just a stretch of mortal time Is this God's experiment
In which we have no say
In which we have no say
In which we're given paradise
Given paradise
But only for a day It's getting late have you seen my mates
Ma tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I want to rock
Want to get a belly full of beer My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
And my old lady she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
A handful of grease in her hair Don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright alright alright Well they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
I may use a little muscle to get what I need
I may sink a little drink and shout out "She's with me!" A couple of the sound that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass Don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright alright alright Saturday (X9) Nights alright (X4) I hope the day will be a lighter highway
For friends are found on every road
Can you ever think of any better way
For the lost and weary travelers to go? Making friends for the world to see
Let the people know you got what you need
With a friend at hand you will see the light
If your friends are there then every thing's all right It seems to me a crime that we should age
These fragile times should never slip us by
A time you never can or shall erase
As friends together watch their childhood fly Making friends for the world to see
Let the people know you got what you need
With a friend at hand you will see the light
If your friends are there then every thing's all right Making friends for the world to see
Let the people know you got what you need
With a friend at hand you will see the light
If your friends are there then every thing's all right Now I know
"Spanish Harlem" are not just pretty words to say
I thought I knew
But now I know that rose trees never grow in New York City Until you've seen this trash-can dream come true
You stand at the edge while people run you through
And I thank the Lord there's people out there like you
I thank the Lord there's people out there like you While Mona Lisas and mad hatters
Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers
Turn around and say good morning to the night
For unless they see the sky
But they can't and that is why
They know not if it's dark outside or light This Broadway's got
It's got a lot of songs to sing
If I knew the tunes I might join in
I go my way alone
Grow my own, my own seeds shall be sown in New York City
Subway's no way for a good man to go down
Rich man can ride and the hobo, he can drown
And I thank the Lord for the people I have found
I thank the Lord for the people I have found While Mona Lisas and mad hatters
Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers
Turn around and say good morning to the night
For unless they see the sky
But they can't and that is why
They know not if it's dark outside or light And now I know
"Spanish Harlem" are not just pretty words to say
I thought I knew
But now I know that rose trees never grow in New York City
Subway's no way for a good man to go down
Rich man can ride and the hobo, he can drown
And I thank the Lord for the people I have found
I thank the Lord for the people I have found While Mona Lisas and mad hatters
Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers
Turn around and say good morning to the night
For unless they see the sky
But they can't and that is why
They know not if it's dark outside or light They know not if it's dark outside or light Lyrics for: Piano Man It's nine o'clock on a saturday
the regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sitting next to me
making love to his tonic and gin He says, son can you play me a memory
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad and it's sweet
and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well we're all in the mood for a melody
and you've got us feeling alright Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
he gets me my drinks for free
and he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
but there's someplace that he'd rather be He says, Bill I believe this is killing me
As a smile ran away from his face
Well i'm sure that I could be a movie star
if I could get out of this place Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
well were all in the mood for a melody
and you've got us feeling all right Now Paul is a real estate novelist
who never had time for a wife
and he's talking to Davy who's still in the Navy
and probably will be for life And the waitress is practicing politics
as the buisnessmen slowly get stoned
yes they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
but its better than drinking alone Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
well we're all in the mood for a melody
and you've got us feeling alright It's a pretty good crowd for a saturday
and the manager gives me a smile
'cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see
to forget about life for a while And the piano sounds like a carnival
and the microphone smells like a beer
and they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
and say, man what are you doing here? Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
well we're all in the mood for a melody
and you've got us feeling alright She packed my bags last night pre-flight
Zero hour, nine a.m.
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no no no, I'm a rocket man
Rocket man burnin' out his fuse up here alone And I think it's gonna be a long long time
Till touch town brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no no no, I'm a rocket man
Rocket man burnin' out his fuse up here alone Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact, it's cold as hell And there's no one there to raise them if you did
And all this science I don't understand
It's just my job five days a week, a rocket man, a rocket man And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no no no, I'm a rocket man
Rocket man burnin' out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no no no, I'm a rocket man
Rock man burnin' out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time (repeat) Hey, Nikita is it cold
In your little corner of the world?
You could roll around the globe
And never find a warmer soul to know Oh, I saw you by the wall
Ten of your tin soldiers in a row
With eyes that looked like ice on fire
The human heart a captive in the snow Oh, Nikita you will never know, anything about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita I need you so
Oh, Nikita is the other side of any given line in time
Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita you'll never know Do you ever dream of me?
Do you ever see the letters that I write?
When you look up through the wire
Nikita do you count the stars at night? And if there comes a time
Guns and gates no longer hold you in
And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west and find a friend Oh, Nikita you will never know, anything about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita I need you so
Oh, Nikita is the other side of any given line in time
Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita you'll never know Oh, Nikita you will never know, never know anything about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita I need you so
Oh, Nikita is the other side of any given line in time
Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita you'll never know
Nikita, counting ten tin soldiers in a row
Nikita, counting ten tin soldiers in a row
Nikita, counting ten tin soldiers in a row
Nikita, counting ten tin soldiers in a row... I can't really explain it
I haven't got the words
It's a feeling that you can't control
I suppose its like forgetting,
losing who you are,
And at the same time,
something makes you whole,
Its like that there's a music,
playing in your ear,
And I'm listening, and I'm listening
and then I dissapear And then I feel a change
Like a fire deep inside
Something bursting me wide open
Impossible to hide And suddenly im flying
Flying like a bird
Like electricity
Electricity
Sparks inside of me
And i'm free, I'm free It's a bit like being angry,
It's a bit like being scared,
Confused and all mixed up,
And mad as hell,
It's like when you've been crying,
And you're empty, and you're full,
I don't know what it is,
It's hard to tell, Its like that theres some music,
playing in your ear,
But the music,
Is impossible,
Impossible to hear, But then i feel it move me,
Like a burning deep inside,
Something bursting me wide open
Impossible to hide Then suddenly im flying
Flying like a bird
Like electricity
Electricity
Sparks inside of me
And i'm free, I'm free Electricity
Sparks inside of me
And i'm free, I'm free
Ohhhh-oh-whoa...
I'm free. What do I got to do to make you love me?
What do I got to do to make you care?
What do I do when lightning strikes me?
And awake to find that you are not there What do I got to do to make you want me?
What do I got to do to be heard?
What do I say when it's all over?
Sorry seems to be the hardest word It's sad (so sad) so sad
It's a sad sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad (so sad) so sad
Why can't we talk it over?
Oh, it seems to me that sorry seems to be the hardest word It's sad (so sad) so sad
It's a sad sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad (so sad) so sad
Why can't we talk it over?
Oh, it seems to me that sorry seems to be the hardest word What do I do to make you love me?
Oh-oh-oh
What do I got to do to be heard?
What do I do when lightning strikes me?
What have I got to do?
What have I got to do?
When sorry seems to be the hardest word It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
Like a deep blue sea
On a blue blue day
Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
When the morning comes
I'll be far away
And I say Blue eyes
Holding back the tears
Holding back the pain
Baby's got blue eyes
And she's alone again Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
Like a clear blue sky
Watching over me
Blue eyes
I love blue eyes
When I'm by her side
Where I long to be
I will see Blue eyes laughing in the sun
Laughing in the rain
Baby's got blue eyes
And I am home, and I am home again I remember when rock was young
Me and Suzie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy, a place of my own But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock Well, Crocodile rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh, lady, mama those Friday nights
When Suzie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile rocking was out of sight Laaaaa, la la la la laaaaa, la la la la laaaaa, la la la la laaaaa But the years went by and the rock just died
Suzie went and left me for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and old blue jeans But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last Well, Crocodile rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess, I never will
Oh, lady, mama those Friday nights
When Suzie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile rocking was out of sight Laaaaa, la la la la laaaaa, l
a la la la laaaaa,
la la la la laaaaa I remember when rock was young
Me and Suzie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy, a place of my own But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock Well, Crocodile rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess, I never will
Oh, lady, mama those Friday nights
When Suzie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile rocking was out of sight Laaaaa, la la la la laaaaa,
la la la la laaaaa,
la la la la laaaaa Laaaaa, la la la la laaaaa, l
a la la la laaaaa,
la la la la laaaaa Laaaaa, la la la la laaaaa, l
a la la la laaaaa,
la la la la laaaaa Guess there are times when we all need to share a little pain
And ironing out the rough spots
Is the hardest part when memories remain
And it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio
Cause from the lips of some old singer
We can share the troubles we already know Turn them on, turn them on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on They reach into your room
Just feel their gentle touch
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say so much If someone else is suffering enough to write it down
When every single word makes sense
Then it's easier to have those songs around
The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you
and it feels so good to hurt so bad
And suffer just enough to sing the blues Turn them on, turn them on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on They reach into your room
Just feel their gentle touch
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say so much Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say so much Turn them on, turn them on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on They reach into your room
Just feel their gentle touch
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say so much When all hope is gone
Sad songs say so much
When all a little bit of hope is gone
Sad songs say so much
When all a little bit of hope is gone
Sad songs say so much
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say... Feel a feeling light
Headed out to see the sights
Ain't life a many splendored thing? Duckin' up and out
All those crazy sights and sounds
Bounce around like puppets on a string Never gonna find
Anything to change my mind
Famous last lines of a fool Just when do you think
You're a chain with just one link
Something comes to tip you off your stool Hello, hello
My, my, my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise Hello, hello
I'm not alone, it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
Hello Do a dizzy dance
Twirl around and take a chance
Nothing's easy, nothing comes for free Sniffing all the flowers
Running through an autumn shower
Compare it to someone else like me Hello, hello
My, my, my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise Hello, hello
I'm not alone, it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
Hello And I can fly on the back of a bird
And I can shake all leaves from a tree
If there's a quest of a knight, I'll just follow right
Do this better than the one I used to be Hello, hello
My, my, my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise Hello, hello
I'm not alone, it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
(Hello) Hello, hello
My, my, my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise Hello, hello
I'm not alone, it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
(Hello) Hello
(Hello)
Hello
Hello, hello I was justified when I was five
Raising cain I spit in your eye
Times are changing now the poor get fat
But the fever's gonna catch you when the bitch gets back
Oh-oh-oh Eat meat on a friday that's alright
Even like steak on a saturday night
I can bitch the best at your social do's
I get high in the evening sniffing pots of glue
Ooh-ooh-ooh I'm a bitch I'm a bitch
Oh the bitch is back
Stone cold sober as a matter of fact
I can bitch I can bitch
'Cause I'm better than you
It's the way that I move
The things that I do
Oh-oh-oh I entertain by picking brains
Sell my soul by dropping names
I don't like those my god what's that
Oh it's full of nasty habits when the bitch gets back
(oh-oh-oh) I'm a bitch I'm a bitch
Oh the bitch is back
Stone cold sober as a matter of fact
I can bitch I can bitch
'Cause I'm better than you
It's the way that I move
The things that I do

Stone cold sober as a matter of fact

(oh-oh-oh)
Bitch bitch
Bitch is back I used to be a rolling stone you know
If the cause was right
I'd leave
To find the answer on the road
I used to be a heart beat for someone
But the times have changed
The less I say the more my work gets done 'Cause I live and breathe
This Philadelphia freedom
From the day that I was born
I've waved the flag
Philadelphia freedom
Took me knee high to a man
Yeah
Gave me peace of mind my daddy never had Oh, Philadelphia freedom
Shine on me
I love you
Shine a light
Through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine a light shine a light
Shine a light won't you shine a light
Philadelphia freedom
I lo o ove you
Yes I do If you choose to you can live your life alone
Some people choose the city
(some people choose the city)
Some others
Choose the good old family home
(pops choose the good old family home)
I like living easy without family ties
('cause it's easy)
Till the whipporwill of freedom
Zapped me
Right between the eyes 'Cause I live and breathe
This Philadelphia freedom
From the day that I was born
I've waved the flag
Philadelphia freedom
Took me knee high to a man
Mmmm, mmmm
Gave me peace of mind my daddy never had Oh, Philadelphia freedom
Shine on me
I love you
Shine a light
Through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine a light shine a light
Shine a light won't you shine a light
Philadelphia freedom
I lo o ove you
Yes I do Oh, Philadelphia freedom
Shine on me
I love you
Shine a light
Through the eyes of the ones left behind
Mmmm, mmmm

You know that I lo o ove you
Yes I do
(Philadelphia freedom)
Oh
Don't you know that I lo o ove you
Yes I do
(Philadelphia freedom)
Ha
Don't you know that I lo o ove you
Yes I do
(Philadelphia freedom) There isn't much I haven't shared
With you along the road
And through it all there'd always be
Tomorrow's episode Suddenly that isn't true
There's another avenue
Beckoning the great divide
Ask no questions, take no side Who's to say who's right or wrong
Whose course is braver run
Still we are, have always been
Will ever be as one What is done has been done for the best
Though the mist in my eyes might suggest
Just a little confusion about what I'll lose
But if I started over I know I would choose The same joy the same sadness each step of the way
That fought me and taught me that friends never say
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye Suddenly that isn't true
There's another avenue
Beckoning, the great divide
I would choose The same joy the same sadness each step of the way
That fought me and taught me that friends never say
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye From the day we arrive on the planet
And blinking, step into the sun
There's more to be seen than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done Some say eat or be eaten
Some say live and let live
But all are agreed as they join the stampede
You should never take more than you give In the circle of life
It's the wheel of fortune
It's the leap of faith
It's the band of hope
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle, the circle of life Some of us fall by the wayside
And some of us soar to the stars
And some of us sail through our troubles
And some have to live with the scars There's far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rolling high through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round In the circle of life
It's the wheel of fortune
It's the leap of faith
It's the band of hope
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle, the circle of life
It's the wheel of fortune
It's the leap of faith
It's the band of hope
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle, the circle of life
On the path unwinding
In the circle, the circle of life What happened here
As the New York sunset disappeared
I found an empty garden among the flagstones there
Who lived here
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And now it all looks strange
It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain And what's it for
This little empty garden by the brownstone door
And in the cracks along the sidewalk nothing grows no more
Who lived here
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And we are so amazed we're crippled and we're dazed
A gardener like that one no one can replace And I've been knocking but no one answers
And I've been knocking most all the day
Oh and I've been calling oh hey hey Johnny
Can't you come out to play And through their tears
Some say he farmed his best in younger years
But he'd have said that roots grow stronger if only he could hear
Who lived there
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now we pray for rain, and with every drop that falls
We hear, we hear your name
And I've been knocking but no one answers
And I've been knocking most all the day
Oh and I've been calling oh hey hey Johnny
Can't you come out to play
And I've been knocking but no one answers
And I've been knocking most all the day
Oh and I've been calling oh hey hey Johnny
Can't you come out,
Can't your come out to play, in the empty garden, Johnny. Johnny can't you come out to play in your empty garden When I look back
Boy, I must have been green
Boppin' in the country
Fishin' in a stream Lookin' for an answer
Tryin' to find a sign
Until I saw your city lights
Honey, I was blind They said, get back, Honky Cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, oh change is gonna do me good You better get back, Honky Cat
Livin' in the city ain't where it's at
It's like tryin' to find gold in a silver mine
It's like tryin' to drink whiskey
Oh, from a bottle of wine Well I read some books and I read some magazines
About those high class ladies
Down in New Orleans
And all the folks back home,
Well, they said I was a fool
They said, oh, believe in the Lord
Is the golden rule They said, get back, Honky Cat
Better get back to the woods
But, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh change is gonna do me good They said, get back, Honky Cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And oh, oh, oh, oh, oh change is gonna do me good They said stay at home, boy, you gotta tend the farm
Livin' in the city, boy is
Is gonna break your heart
But how can you stay when your heart says no?
How can you stop when your feet say go? You better get back, Honky Cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh the change is gonna do me good You better get back, Honky Cat
Livin' in the city ain't where it's at
It's like tryin' to find gold in a silver mine
It's like tryin' to drink whiskey
Oh, from a bottle of wine oh yeah Get back, honky cat
Get back, honky cat
Get back, wooh Get back, honky cat
Get back, honky cat
Get back, wooh Oh get back, honky cat
Get back, get back, honky cat, wooh, oh yeah Wooh The roses in the window box have tilted to one side
Everything about this house was born to grow and die
Oh, it doesn't seem a year ago to this very day
You said, "I'm sorry, honey, if I don't change the pace
I can't face another day" And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you, so I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands I wonder if those changes have left a scar on you
Like all the burning hoops of fire that you and I passed through
You're a bluebird on a telegraph line, I hope you're happy now
Well, if the wind of change comes down your way, girl
You'll make it back somehow And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you, so I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh, it kill me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you, so I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands Love lies bleeding in my hands Catch a star if you can
Wish for something special
Let it be me, my love is free Sing a song to yourself
Think of someone listening
One melody, you're all for me I'll write a symphony just for you and me
If you let me love you
I'll paint a masterpiece just for you to see
If you let me love you, let me love you Are you ready, are you ready for love?
Yes, I am, are you?
Are you ready, are you ready for love?
Yes I am, are you? Are you ready, are you ready for love? You're the one like the sun
Shine your love around me
You'll always be the one for me Say the word and I'll be there
Loving you forever
Don't let me go, just say it's so We'll hear the music ring from the mountain tops to the valley below us
We'll serenade the world with a lullaby
So the angels will know us
Angels will know us Are you ready, are you ready for love?
Yes, I am, are you?
Are you ready, are you ready for love?
Yes I am, yes I am, yes I am, yes I am, yes I am Are you ready, are you ready for love?

Are you ready, are you ready for love?
Yes I am, are you? Are you ready, are you ready for love?
Yes, I am, are you?
Are you ready, are you ready for love?
Yes I am, are you? Hey you, you're a child in my head
You haven't walked yet
Your first words have yet to be said
But I swear you'll be blessed
I know you're still just a dream
Your eyes might be green
Or the bluest that I've ever seen
Anyway, you'll be blessed And you, you'll be blessed
You'll have the best
I promise you that
I'll pick a star from the sky
Pull your name from a hat
I promise you that, promise you that
Promise you that you'll be blessed I need you before I'm too old
To have and to hold
To walk with you and watch you grow
And know that you're blessed And you, you'll be blessed
You'll have the best
I promise you that
I'll pick a star from the sky
Pull your name from a hat
I promise you that, promise you that
You, you'll be blessed
You'll have the best
I promise you that
I'll pick a star from the sky
Pull your name from a hat
I promise you that, promise you that
Promise you that you'll be blessed (promise you that, promise you that, promise you that)
You'll be blessed
(promise you that, promise you that, promise you that)
You'll be blessed
You'll be blessed! I want love, but it's impossible
A man like me, so irresponsible
A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated
I can't love, shot full of holes
Don't feel nothing, I just feel cold
Don't feel nothing, just old scars
Toughening up around my heart But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love, that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love I want love on my own terms
After everything I've ever learned
Me, I carry too much baggage
Oh man I've seen so much traffic But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love, that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love So bring it on, I've been bruised
Don't give me love that's clean and smooth
I'm ready for the rougher stuff
No sweet romance, I've had enough
A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love, that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love, that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love Deny the passenger, who want to get on Deny the passenger, who want to get on

We dug his shallow grave beneath the sun
I laid his broken body down below the southern land
It wouldn't do to bury him where any Yankee stands I'll take my horse and I'll ride the Northern plain
To wear the colour of the greys and join the fight again
And I'll rest until I know the cause is fought and won
From this day on until I die I'll wear my father's gun I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans well that's just fine alright
'Cause there's fightin' there and the company needs men
(Aaa aaa aaa)
So slip us a rope and sail on round the bend As soon as this is over we'll go home
To plant the seeds of justice in our bones
To watch the children growin' and see the women sewin'
There'll be laughter when the bells of freedom ring I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight

That's just fine alright The roses in the window box
Have tilted to one side
Everything about this house
Was born to grow and die Oh it doesn't seem a year ago
To this very day
You said I'm sorry honey
If I don't change the pace
I can't face another day And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you
So I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands I wonder if those changes
Have left a scar on you
Like all the burning hoops of fire
That you and I passed through You're a bluebird on a telegraph line
I hope you're happy now
Well if the wind of change comes down your way girl
You'll make it back somehow Turn me loose from your hands
Let me fly to distant lands
Over green fields, trees and mountains
Flowers and forest fountains
Home along the lanes of the skyway For this dark and lonely room
Projects a shadow cast in gloom
And my eyes are mirrors
Of the world outside
Thinking of the way
That the wind can turn the tide
And these shadows turn From purple into grey For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
He can spread his wings
And fly away again
Fly away skyline pigeon fly
Towards the dreams
You've left so very far behind
Fly away skyline pigeon fly Towards the dreams
You've left so very far behind Just let me wake up in the morning To the smell of new mown hay
To laugh and cry, to live and die
In the brightness of my day I want to hear the pealing bells
Of distant churches sing
But most of all please free me
From this aching metal ring
And open out this cage towards the sun
For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
He can spread his wings
And fly away again
Fly away skyline pigeon fly
Towards the dreams
You've left so very far behind
Fly away skyline pigeon fly
Towards the dreams
You've left so very, so very far behind Holy Moses I have been removed
I have seen the specter he has been here too
Distant cousin from down the line
Brand of people who ain't my kind
Holy Moses I have been removed Holy Moses I have been deceived
Now the wind has changed direction and I'll have to leave
Won't you please excuse my frankness but it's not my cup of tea
Holy Moses I have been deceived I'm going back to the border
Where my affairs, my affairs ain't abused
I can't take any more bad water
I've been poisoned from my head down to my shoes Holy Moses I have been deceived
Holy Moses let us live in peace
Let us strive to find a way to make all hatred cease
There's a man over there what's his color I don't care
He's my brother let us live in peace
He's my brother let us live in peace
He's my brother let us live in peace Goodbye, Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name And it seems to me, you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
And I would have liked to know you, but I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
All the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude And it seems to me, you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
And I would have liked to know you, but I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did Goodbye, Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye, Norma Jean
From the young man in the twenty-second row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe And it seems to me, you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
And I would have liked to know you, but I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did Haven't you heard what's new?
There is a rumor
Going around that suddenly I've found you Better believe it's true
I got a feeling
This is for real and nobody else will do You are my princess
You make me smile
You make my life seem worthwhile You are my princess
You are the one
You make the sun shine on me You're one fine lady
You're my princess
You're my princess Haven't you heard them say?
I was a prisoner
Buried alive now suddenly I've been freed But love is the sweetest way
Oh, I was lonely
And now you're the only lover that I'll ever need You are my princess
You make me smile
You make my life seem worthwhile You are my princess
The only one
You make the sun shine on me You're one fine lady
You're my princess
You're my princess You're my princess
You're my princess You are my princess
You make me smile
You make my life seem worthwhile You are my princess
The only one
You make the sun shine on me You're one fine lady

And I can't explain but it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away it's that feeling I get about you, deep inside
And I can't describe but it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away the way you look tonight With you smile, you pull the deepest secrets from my heart
In all honesty I'm speechless and I don't know where to start

... I can see very well.
There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
And I can see it very well.
There's a joke and I know it very well,
It's one of those that I told you long ago.
Take my word I'm a madman don't you know. Once a fool had a good part in the play,
If it's so would I still be here today?
It's quite peculiar in a funny sort of way,
They think it's very funny everything I say.
Get a load of him, he's so insane
You'd better get your coat dear
It looks like rain. We'll come again next Thursday afternoon.
The inlaws hope they'll see you very soon.
But is it in your conscience that you're after
Another glimpse of the Madman across the Water. I can see very well.
There's a boat on the reef with a broken back

There's a joke and I know it very well,
It's one of those that I told you long ago.
Take my word I'm a madman don't you know. The ground's a long way down but I need more.
Is the nightmare black
Or are the windows painted?
Will they come again next week,
Can my mind really take it? We'll come again next Thursday afternoon.
The inlaws hope they'll see you very soon.
But is it in your conscience that you're after
Another glimpse of the Madman across the Water. Take me down to the water
Take me back to the source
Call the meeting to order
And let it run its course Take me back to my childhood
When I was so alone
Let me feel like a child would
Looking out across the great unknown Take me down to the ocean
Take me down to the sea
Set the feeling in motion
Forget the tied up time and let my spirit free Take away the illusion
Of the man, of the king
Help me lose the confusion
So I can breathe again Take me down to the ocean
Take me down to the sea
Set the feeling in motion
So you can just be you and I can just be me If you feel that it's real I'm on trial
And I'm here in your prison
Like a coin in your mint
I am dented and I'm spent with high treason Through a glass eye your throne
Is the one danger zone
Take me to the pilot for control
Take me to the pilot of your soul Take me to the pilot
Lead me through the chamber

Ohh, Bennie and the Jets Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Aaaaaah Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Aaaaaah Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Aaaaaah
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Aaaaaah
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

Lucy in the sky with diamonds... The words I have to say
May well be simple but they? re true
Until you give your love
There? s nothing more that we can do Love is the opening door
Love is what we came here for
No one could offer you more
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen? You say it? s very hard
To leave behind the life we knew
But there? s no other way
And now it? s really up to you Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must burn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen? Love is the opening door
Love is what we came here for
No one could offer you more
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen? Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen? I used to know this old scarecrow
He was my song,
My joy and sorrow
Cast alone between the furrows
Of a field
No longer sown by anyone
I held a dandelion
That said the time had come
To leave upon the wind
Not to return
When summer burned the earth again
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Cultivate the freshest flower
This garden ever grew
Beneath these branches
I once wrote
Such childish words for you
But that's okay
There's treasure children always seek to find
And just like us
You must have had
A once upon a time
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh Oh, it's carnival night
And they're stringing the lights around you
Hanging paper angels
Painting little devils on the roof Oh the furnace wind
Is a flickering of wings about your face
In a cloud of incense
Yeah, it smells like Heaven in this place I can't eat, can't sleep
Still I hunger for you when you look at me
That face, those eyes
All the sinful pleasures deep inside Tell me how, you know now, the ways and means of getting in
Underneath my skin
Oh you were always my original sin
And tell me why, I shudder inside, every time we begin
This dangerous game
Oh you were always my original sin A dream will fly
The moment that you open up your eyes
A dream is just a riddle
Ghosts from every corner of your life Up in the balcony
All the Romeo's are bleeding for your hand
Blowing theater kisses
Reciting lines they don't understand I can't eat, can't sleep
Still I hunger for you when you look at me
That face, those eyes
All the sinful pleasures deep inside Tell me how, you know now, the ways and means of getting in
Underneath my skin
Oh you were always my original sin
And tell me why, I shudder inside, every time we begin
This dangerous game
Oh you were always my original sin
Tell me how, you know now, the ways and means of getting in
Underneath my skin
Oh you were always my original sin
Tell me why, I shudder inside, every time we begin
This dangerous game
Oh you were always my original sin Life

Isn't everything Life
Isn't everything
Isn't everything
Isn't everything Life... Take a look at me now and take a taste of the money
I'm not in it for the bread, I'm in it for the gravy, honey
Step on the thin ice lightly
And check out the show twice nightly Oh 'cause I, I'm on the stage tonight
And if the price is right
I, I will amaze before the light, I crave the light
Blinding white, I need the light tonight Take a look at me now and take a look at my billing
I'm not in it as an extra, I'm in it for the killing
Inflate my ego gently
Tell them Heaven sent me Oh 'cause I, I'm so expressive
And I'm so obsessed with my ego, my ego
And its message, oh inform the press
Invite the guests, I need the press tonight Do you remember acting out your youth?
A Romeo resplendent on an orange case
Do you remember how I would recite
And how I'd blow my lines and hide my face? Well maybe it was childish
Foolish, before schoolish
Immaturish, lose your coolish
I had to grow and prove my ego Take a look at me now and take a taste of the money
I'm not in it for the bread, I'm in it for the gravy, honey
Inflate my ego gently
Oh tell them Heaven sent me Oh 'cause I'm so expressive
And I'm so obsessed with my ego, my ego
And its message, oh inform the press
Invite the guests, I need the press tonight Do you remember acting out your youth?
Romeo resplendent on an orange case
Do you remember how I would recite
And how I'd blow my lines and hide my face? Well maybe it was childish
Foolish, before schoolish
Immaturish, lose your coolish I was childish, foolish
Before schoolish
Immaturish, lose your coolish
But I, I had to grow and prove my ego Spring is here, the sky is blue
Birds will sing as if they knew
Today's the day, we'll say "I do"
And we'll never be lonely any more Because we're going to the chapel
And we're gonna to get married
Going to the chapel
And we're gonna get married
Gee I really love you
And we're gonna get married
Going to the chapel of love Bells will ring, the sun will shine
I will be hers, and she'll be mine
We'll love until the end of time
And we'll never be lonely any more Captain Fantastic, raised and regimented, hardly a hero
Just someone his mother might know
Very clearly a case for Corn Flakes and classics
"Two teas both with sugar please"
In the back of an alley While little dirt cowboys turned brown in their saddles
Sweet chocolate biscuits and red rosy apples in summer
For it's hay make and "Hey mom, do the papers say anything good
Are there chances in life for little dirt cowboys
Should I make my way out of my home in the woods" Brown Dirt Cowboy, still green and growing
City slick Captain
Fantastic the feedbag
The honey the hive could be holding
For there's weak winged young sparrows that starve in the winter
Broken young children on the wheels of the winners
And the sixty-eight summer festival wallflowers are thinning For cheap easy meals, hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town And all this talk of Jesus coming back to see us
Mmm mmm couldn't fool us
For we were spinning out our lines walking on the wire
Hand in hand went music and the rhyme
The Captain and the Kid stepping in the ring
From here on sonny sonny sonny, it's a long and lonely climb For cheap easy meals, hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town These battered hands are all you own
this broken heart has turned to stone
go hang your glory on the wall
there comes a time when castles fall
and all that's left is shifting in the sand
You're out of time, you're out of place
look at your face
that's the measure of a man
This coat that fits you like a glove
these dirty streets you learned to love
so welcome back my long lost friend
you've been to hell and back again
god alone knows how you crossed that span
Back on the beat, back to the start
trust in your heart
that's the measure of a man
It's the fire in the eyes, the lines on the hand
it's the things you understand
permanent ties from which you once ran
that's the measure of a man
You've come full circle, now you're home
without the gold, without the chrome
and this is where you've always been
you had to lose so you could win
and rise above your troubles while you can
Now you can love, now you can lose
now you can choose
that's the measure of a man it's the fire in the eyes, the lines on the hand
it's the things you understand
permanent ties from which you once ran
that's the measure of a man
You've come full circle, now you're home
without the gold, without the chrome
and this is where you've always been
you had to lose so you could win
and rise above your troubles while you can
Now you can love, now you can lose
now you can choose
that's the measure of a man When I wake up in the morning
And the clock gives out a warning
I don't think I'll ever make it on time
By the time I GRAB my books I give myself a look
I'm at the corner just in time to see the bus fly by It's alright cause I'm saved by the bell If the teacher pops a test I know I'm a mess
And my dog ate all my homework last night
if i sit low in my chair she won't know that I'm there
If I can hand it in tomorrw it'll be alright It's alright 'cause I'm saved by the-.
It's alright 'cause I'm saved by the -.
It's alright 'cause I'm saved by the bell. Music by ??

Never released (The Bread And Beer Band) [instrumental] Oh, little Jeannie
You got so much love
Little Jeannie
And you take it where it strikes
And give it to the likes of me Oh, little Jeannie
She got so much love
Little Jeannie
So I see you when I can
You make me all a man can be And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others
Who would treat you cruel
And, oh, Jeannie
You were always someone's fool Little Jeannie
You got so much time
Little Jeannie
Though you've grown beyond your years
You still retain the fears of youth Oh, little Jeannie
You got so much time
Little Jeannie
But you're burning it up so fast
Searching for some lasting truth And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others
Who would treat you cruel
But, oh, Jeannie
I will always be your fool And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others
And I've known quite a few
But oh, Jeannie
I'm still in love with you (You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Making the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new)
Oh, Jeannie (Oh, Jeannie)
I'm so in love with you (You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Making the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new)
Oh, Jeannie (Oh, Jeannie)
I'm so in love with you (You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Making the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new)
Oh, Jeannie (Oh, Jeannie)
I'm so in love with you (You stepped into my life from a bad dream) So in love
(Making the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new) So in love with you
Oh, Jeannie (Oh, Jeannie)
I'm so in love, I'm so (You stepped into my life from a bad dream) In love
(Making the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new) So in love with you Every time you turn around
You wear another face
Every time I look away
I find a hiding place If you knew me like you knew him
You would know just how I feel
Slipping through someone's fingers
Falling under someone's wheels It's easier to walk away
Better off to face the facts
When love holds you up for ransom
Walk away and don't look back Never seen you looking back through
Smiling eyes and tears
Never knew you holding on to
Memories and fears Just release me I can't take it
Can't you see a change has come
Strangled by infatuation
Buried under someone's thumb It's easier to walk away
Cover and fade to black
When love scars and leaves you branded
Walk away and don't look back Every time you turn around
You wear another face
Every time I look away
I find a hiding place It's easier to walk away
Cover and fade to black
When love scars and leaves you branded
Walk away and don't look back It's easier to walk away
Cover and fade to black
When love scars and leaves you branded
Walk away and don't look back I never dreamed I could cry so hard
That ain't like a man
I could fly like a bird some days
Had a place where I could land I could have sworn we were all locked in
Ain't that what you said
I never knew it could hurt so bad
When the power of love is dead But giving into the nighttime
Ain't no cure for the pain
You gotta wade into the water
You gotta learn to live again And reach out for her healing hands
Reach out for her healing hands
There's a light, where the darkness ends
Touch me now and let me see again
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands I never knew love like poison
That burned like a fire
All I ever wanted was a reason
To drown in your eyes I never knew sleep so restless
Empty arms so cold
That's not the way it's supposed to be
It ain't the spell that I was sold But giving into the nighttime
Ain't no cure for the pain
You gotta wade into the water
You gotta learn to live again And reach out for her healing hands
Reach out for her healing hands
There's a light, where the darkness ends
Touch me now and let me see again
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands Giving into the nighttime
Ain't no cure for the pain
You gotta wade into the water
You gotta learn to live again And reach out for her healing hands
Reach out for her healing hands
There's a light, where the darkness ends
Touch me now and let me see again
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands Reach out for her healing hands
Reach out for her healing hands
There's a light, where the darkness ends
Touch me now and let me see again
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands Rock me now
Reach out for her healing hands
Reach out for her healing hands
There's a light, where the darkness ends
Touch me now and let me see again Boston at last and the plane's touching down
Our hostess is handing the hot towels around
From a terminal gate to a black limousine
It's a ten minute ride to the Holiday Inn Boredom's a pastime that one soon acquired
Where you get to the stage where you're not even tired
Kicking your heels till the time comes around
To pick up your bags and head out of town Slow down Joe, I'm a rock and roll man
I've twiddled my thumbs in a dozen odd bands
And you ain't seen nothing till you've been
In a motel baby like the Holiday Inn Slow down Joe, I'm a rock and roll man
I've twiddled my thumbs in a dozen odd bands
And you ain't seen nothing till you've been
In a motel baby like the Holiday Inn We've been crippled in love, short changed, hung out to dry
We've chalked on the walls a slogan or two about life
Stood dazed in the doorway, the king and queen of clowns
We've been flipped like a coin, both of us landing face-down So please, please, let me grow old with you
After everything we've been through, what's left to prove
so please, please, please, oh please let me grow old with you We've been living with sorrow, been up, down and all around
We've buried our feelings a little too deep in the ground
Stood dazed in the doorway, the king and queen of clowns
We've been flipped like a coin, both of us landing face-down So please, please, let me grow old with you
After everything we've been through, what's left to prove
so please, please, please, oh please let me grow old with you But tied to the same track, the two of us look back
At oncoming trains ahead
How many more times can we lay on the line
Watching our love hang by a thread So please, please, let me grow old with you
After everything we've been through, what's left to prove
so please, please, please, oh please
let me grow old with you
please, please, please, oh please
let me grow old with you Who'll walk me down to church when I'm sixty years of age
When the ragged dog they gave me has been ten years in the grave
And señorita play guitar, play it just for you
My rosary has broken and my beads have all slipped through You've hung up your great coat and you've laid down your gun
You know the war you fought in wasn't too much fun
And the future you're giving me holds nothing for a gun
I've no wish to be living sixty years on Yes I'll sit with you and talk let your eyes relive again
I know my vintage prayers would be very much the same
And Magdelena plays the organ, plays it just for you
Your choral lamp that burns so low when you are passing through And the future you're giving me holds nothing for a gun
I've no wish to be living sixty years on You can win the fight, you can grab a piece of the sky
You can break the rules but before you try
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone You can stop the world, steal the face from the moon
You can beat the clock, but before high noon
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone You've got one life with a reason
You need two hearts on one side
When you stand alone and there's no one there
To share the way it feels inside and baby You can cheat the devil and slice a piece of the sun
Burn up the highway but before you run
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone When you're gonna play with fire
You let someone share the heat
When you're on your own and there's no one there
To cool the flames beneath your feet and baby You can win the fight, you can grab a piece of the sky
You can break the rules but before you try
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone

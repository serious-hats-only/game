The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

Just like I'd never gone I knew the song
Young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday not far away Tropical (ah-ah) the island breeze
All of nature (ah-ah-ah-ah) wild and free
This is where I long to be
La Isla Bonita
And when (ah-ah) the samba played
The sun (ah-ah-ah-ah) would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your spanish lullaby I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last they went so fast Tropical (ah-ah) the island breeze
All of nature (ah-ah-ah-ah) wild and free
This is where I long to be
La Isla Bonita
And when (ah-ah) the samba played
The sun (ah-ah-ah-ah) would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your spanish lullaby I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta
You can watch them go by
Beautiful faces no cares in this world
Where girl loves a boy and a boy... loves a girl Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday not far away Tropical (ah-ah) the island breeze
All of nature (ah-ah-ah-ah) wild and free
This is where I long to be
La Isla Bonita
And when (ah-ah) the samba played
The sun (ah-ah-ah-ah) would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your spanish lullaby

Tropical (ah-ah) the island breeze
All of nature (ah-ah-ah-ah) wild and free
This is where I long to be

The sun (ah-ah-ah-ah) would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

It's coming Rain... feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like rain...
Wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain... When your lips are burning mine
And you take the time
To tell me how you feel
When you listen to my words
And I know you've heard
I know it's real
Rain is what this thunder brings
For the first time, I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
Till I feel your Rain... feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like rain...
Wash away my sorrow, take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain... When you looked into my eyes
And you said goodbye
Could you see my tears...
When I turned the other way
Did you hear me say
I'd wait for all the dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky
You promised me when you said goodbye
That you'd return when the storm was done
And now I wait for the light,
I'll wait for the sun, till I feel your Rain... feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on the window pane
Your love's coming down like rain...
Wash away my sorrow, take away my pain
Your love's coming down like Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
And I say... never go away... Waiting is the hardest thing [It's strange]
I tell myself that if I believe in you [I feel like I've known you before]
In the dream of you [I want to understand you more]
With all my heart and all my soul [And more and more]
That by sheer force of will [When I'm with you]
I will raise you from the ground [I feel like a magical child]
And without a sound you'll appear [Everything strange]
And surrender to me [Everything wild]
To love Rain is what the thunder brings
For the first time, I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
Till I feel your Rain...
I feel it, it's coming
Your love's coming down like rain...
I feel it, it's coming
Your love's coming down like rain...
Feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on the window pane
Your love's coming down like rain...
Wash away my sorrow, take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain... I feel it, it's coming
Your love's coming down like rain...
I feel it, it's coming
Your love's coming down like rain... You step out on the mountaintop
And you're free to call my name
Rain... I have a tale to tell
Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned till then it will burn inside of me I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once
I know the warmth she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside you can't take that from me... A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned till then it will burn inside of me... The truth is never far behind
You've kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again? If I ran away
I'd never have the strength to go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart...?
Will it grow cold?
(will it grow cold?)
The secret that I hide
Will I grow old?
How will they hear?
When will they learn?
How will they know...? A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned till then it will burn inside of me... The truth is never far behind
You've kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again...?
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned till then it will burn inside of me... A long, long time ago
I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew that if I had my chance
I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so
Now do you believe in rock 'n roll
And can music save your mortal soul
And can you teach me how to dance real slow Well I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes Man, I dig those rhythm 'n blues I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew that I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin' Bye bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', "This will be the day that I die,
This will be the day that I die." I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
Well I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play Well now in the streets the children screamed (the children screamed)
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed (the poets dreamed)
But not a word was spoken (not a word was spoken)
The church bells all were broken And the three men I admire the most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
We start singin' Bye bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', "This will be the day that I die,
This will be the day that I die." Bye bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', "This will be the day that I die,
This will be the day that I die." We started singin'
We started singin'
We started singin'
We started singin' I lived my life like a masochist
Hearing my father say, "Told you so, told you so,
Why can't you be like the other girls?"
I said, "Oh no, that's not me and I don't think that it'll ever be" Thought I belong to a different tribe
Walking alone, never satisfied, satisfied
Tried to fit in but it wasn't me,
I said, "Oh no, I want more, that's not what I'm looking for" So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in the depth of my rebel heart I spent some time as a narcissist
Hearing the others say, "Look at you, look at you"
Trying to be so provocative
I said, "Oh yeah, that was me"
All the things I did just to be seen Outgrown my past and I've shed my skin
Letting it go and I'll start again, start again
Never look back, it's a waste of time
I said, "Oh yeah, this is me"
And I'm right here where I wanna be
I said, "Hell yeah! This is me"
Right where I'm supposed to be So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in my rebel heart So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in the depth
Of my rebel heart
My rebel heart My love's a revolver
My love's a revolver Oops I guess I shot ya
My finger's on the trigger
I had a bullet with your name on it Click click, I'm a sex pistol

Come on girls
Do you believe in love?
'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last no-no What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey-hey-hey-hey So if you want it right now
Make him show you how
Express what he's got
Oh, baby ready or not And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees To express himself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey-hey Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey-hey-hey-hey So if you want it right now
Make him show you how
Express what he's got
Baby ready or not Express yourself
Respect yourself
Hey-hey (so if you want it right now)
(then make him show you how)
Express what he's got
Oh, baby ready or not Express yourself

It's like the force of gravity right up under my feet
It's so erotic
This feeling can't be beat
It's coursing through my whole body, feel the heat I got that burnin' hot desire
And no one can put out my fire

Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey-ey-ey-ey-eh-ey

Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue, baby, I love you

Those tear drops they won't fall again
I'm so excited 'cause you're my best friend
So if you should ever doubt
Wonder what love is all about
Just think back and remember dear
Those words whispered in your ear, I said
True love

Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue, baby, I love you
'Cause it's true love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue, baby, I love you
No more sadness, I kiss it goodbye
The sun is bursting right out of the sky
I searched the whole world for someone like you
Don't you know, don't you know that it's
True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love
It's true love, oh baby, true love, oh baby

I'm tired of waiting on you I have a tale to tell I was three feet from the floor, gasping for air
Trying to release my fathers hands from my throat
I looked into his eyes and wondered
If my feet would ever touch the floor again Have you ever been hit so hard
That it sends your body flying across the room
We all fall to the floor at some point
It's how you pick yourself up, that's the real challenge, isn't it? I've always lived in my own world, I dance to escape my troubles
I've learnt that there's light even in the darkest places
I can't blame my father for anything
You can't rely on other people to make you happy
But I know deep down inside he loved me It was a time I suffered so much
I wanted to get it out of me
I would cut my arms, not to kill myself, I don't want to die
I know I am lucky to be on this earth I did it so the physical pain would calm the pain
That was eating me inside, nothing was erased
I live with my past tucked away, deep inside of me
It comes out as an explosion and it invades me I believe we are messengers on earth
I believe in Angels
I am blessed by God to tell myself I suffered that much
To become who I am today Now you have to realize not only do I have a family
But now I have a whole hood and that's power
But I ain't no primy ass nigga
I was never out to kill anybody
Specially when I made that decision of gang bang, I just wanted to fit in But one day I was forced to do something
That made me open my eyes and realize that this ain't no game
One of the homies got popped
And I was the first one doing my first drop by
It was kinda fucked up the way they tried to set me up Me and my bro, we was headed back to the A block
Then some homies rolled up and they asked us to go somewhere
We pulled up to the corner
Then he pressed the chunky ass gun in my lap
He said you know what to do really, it's time to get poppy for the hood That was not to kill anybody [Holiday celebration]
[Holiday celebration] If we took a holiday
Took some times to celebrate Just one day out of life
We're gonna have a celebration All across the world in very nation
It's time for the good times. Forget about the bad times, oh yeah
One day to come together To release the pressure
We need a holiday. If we took a holiday
[Oooo] Took some time to celebrate
[Come on let's celebrate] Just one day out of life.
[Holiday] It would be, it would be so nice.
If we took a holiday. [Oh yeah, oh yeah]
Took some time to celebrate [Come on let's celebrate]

It would be, it would be so nice. You can torn this world around
And bring back all of those happy days Put your troubles down
Its time to celebrate. Let love shine And we will find
A way to come together Can make things better
We need a holiday. He we took a holiday

Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water
Don't it taste like holy water (Yeezus loves my pussy best) When I move a certain way
I feel an ache I'd kept at bay
A hairline break that's taking hold
A metal that I thought was gold And pure so sure i'd struck a vein
I wanted you to feel the same
So when you did ignite a spark
Rescue me from all this dark
See our hearts are intertwined
Then I'm free, free of mine
I'm falling free See our hearts are intertwined
And then I'm free, I'm free of mine
Deep and pure, our hearts align
And then I'm free, I'm free of mine When I raise a certain wing
And crawl beneath that growing thing
It throws a shadow over time
And keeps yours falling next to mine Your days were meant to fly and do
I fall and fold mine into you
And what you take is just enough
And what you give is what I love And when you leave you raise the sail
And then I'm free, free to fail
I'm falling free Deep and pure, our hearts align
And then I'm free, I'm free of mine
When I let loose the need to know
Then we're both free, we're free to go When I lose a certain claim
That tries to know and needs to blame
Whatever river runs aground
It turns my head and washes down The face of God that stands above
Pouring over hope and love
That all of might and life and limb
Could turn around and love again
When I let loose the need to know
Then we're both free, free to go
I'm falling free I'm falling
I'm falling
I'm falling free I'm falling
I'm falling
I'm falling free Deep and pure, our hearts align
And then I'm free, I'm free of mine
When I let loose the need to know
Then we're both free, we're free to go Deep and pure, our hearts align
And then I'm free, I'm free of mine
I let loose the need to know
And we're both free, free to go Where do we go from here?
This isn't where we intended to be
We had it all, you believed in me
I believed in you Certainties disappear
What do we do for our dream to survive?
How do we keep all our passions alive,
As we used to do? Deep in my heart I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away You must love me
You must love me Why are you at my side?
How can I be any use to you now?
Give me a chance and I'll let you see how
Nothing has changed You must love me Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of morning
Sink beneath the sun
She's got herself a universe, gone quickly
For the call of thunder
Threatens everyone And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel Faster than the speeding light, she's flying
Trying to remember
Where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when
Earth shall be as one And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning
Sink beneath the sun
She's got herself a universe, gone quickly
For the call of thunder
Threatens everyone
And I feel... Quicker than a ray of light, then gone for
Someone else will be there
Through the endless years She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe And I feel
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel Quicker than a ray of light
She's flying
Quicker than a ray of light
I'm flying I don't expect my love affairs to last for long
Never fool myself that my dreams will come true
Being used to trouble I anticipate it
But all the same I hate it, wouldn't you? So what happens now?
(Another suitcase in another hall)
So what happens now?
(Take your picture off another wall)
Where am I going to?
(You'll get by, you always have before)
Where am I going to? Time and time again I've said that I don't care
That I'm immune to gloom, that I'm hard through and through
But every time it matters all my words desert me
So anyone can hurt me and they do So what happens now?
(Another suitcase in another hall)
So what happens now?
(Take your picture off another wall)
Where am I going to?
(You'll get by, you always have before)
Where am I going to? Call in three months time and I'll be fine, I know
Well, maybe not that fine, but I'll survive anyhow
I won't recall the names and places of each sad occasion
But that's no consolation here and now So what happens now?
(Another suitcase in another hall)
So what happens now?
(Take your picture off another wall) Where am I going to?
(You'll get by, you always have before)
Where am I going to?
(Don't ask anymore) Chorus (first time without background vocals): This used to be my playground [used to be]
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need
Of a friend
Why did it have to end
And why do they always say Don't look back
Keep your head held high
Don't ask them why
Because life is short
And before you know
You're feeling old
And your heart is breaking
Don't hold on to the past
Well that's too much to ask (Long and movie versions only:) (chorus)
Live and learn
Well the years they flew
And we never knew
We were foolish then
We would never tire
And that little fire
Is still alive in me
It will never go away
Can't say goodbye to yesterday [can't say goodbye] (chorus) No regrets
But I wish that you
Were here with me
Well then there's hope yet
I can see your face
In our secret place
You're not just a memory
Say goodbye to yesterday [the dream]
Those are words I'll never say [I'll never say] This used to be my playground [used to be]
This used to be our pride and joy
This used to be the place we ran to
That no one in the world could dare destroy (Short and movie versions only:) This used to be our playground [used to be]
This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
I wish you were standing here with me (Movie version only:) This used to be our playground [used to be]
This used to be our great escape
This used to be the place we ran to
This used to be our secret hiding place This used to be our playground [used to be]
This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
The best things in life are always free
Wishing you were here with me I just woke up from a fuzzy dream
You never would believe those things that I have seen
I looked in the mirror and I saw your face
You looked right through me, you were miles away
All my dreams they fade away
I'll never be the same
If you could see me the way you see yourself
I can't pretend to be someone else
You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me, miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
When no one's around then I have you here
I begin to see the picture, it becomes so clear
You always have the biggest heart
When we're six thousand miles apart
Too much of no sound
Uncomfortable silence can be so loud
Those three words are never enough
When it's long distance love

Descamisados, mis companeros
When they fire those cannons, when the crowds sing of glory

A rare and priceless work of art
Stay behind your velvet rope
But I will not renounce all hope
And I'm right by your side
Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of a masterpiece
And I can't tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with the masterpiece
'Cause after all
Nothing's indestructible
From the moment I first saw you
All the darkness turned to light
An impressionistic painting
Tiny particles of light
It seems to me is what you're like
The "look but please don't touch me" type
And honestly it can't be fun
To always be the chosen one And I'm right by your side Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of a masterpiece
And I can't tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece
'Cause after all
Nothing's indestructible
Nothing's indestructible Nothing's indestructible

Without your love, you'll see
You think I can't go on another day You think I have nothing
Without you by my side
You'll see, somehow, someway You think that I can't
Never laugh again, you'll see
You think that you've
Destroyed my faith in love You think after all you've done
I'll never find my way back home
You'll see, somehow, someday All by myself
I don't need anyone at all
I know I'll survive
I know I'll stay alive All on my own
I don't need anyone this time
It will be mine
No one can take it from me
You'll see You think that you are strong
But you are weak, you'll see
It takes more strength to cry
Admit defeat I have truth on my side
You only have deceit
You'll see, somehow, someday All by myself
I don't need anyone at all
I know I'll survive
I know I'll stay alive
I'll stand on my own

When the world gets cold, I'll be your cover
Let's just hold onto each other
When it all falls, when it all falls down
We'll be two souls in a Ghosttown Tell me how we got this far
Every man for himself
Everything's gone to hell
We gotta stay strong, we're gonna hold on
This world has turned to dust
All we've got left is love
Might as well start with us
Singing a new song, something to build on Ah ah, I know you're scared tonight
Ah ah, I'll never leave your side When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When there's no one, no one else around
We'll be two souls in a Ghosttown
When the world gets cold, I'll be your cover
Let's just hold onto each other
When it all falls, when it all falls down
We'll be two souls in a Ghosttown I know we're alright, 'cause we'll never be alone
In this mad-mad, in this mad-mad world
Even with no light, we're gonna shine like gold
In this mad-mad, in this mad-mad world When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When there's no one, no one else around
We'll be two souls in a Ghosttown When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When there's no one, no one else around
We'll be two souls in a Ghosttown
When the world gets cold, I'll be your cover
Let's just hold onto each other
When it all falls, when it all falls down
We'll be two souls in a Ghosttown
When it all falls, when it all falls down
We'll be two souls in a Ghosttown First you love me, and I let you in
Made me feel like I was born again
You empowered me, you made me strong
Built me up, and I can do no wrong
I let down my guard, I fell into your arms
Forgot who I was
I didn't hear the alarms, now I'm down on my knees
Alone in the dark
I was blind to your game, you fired a shot in my heart Took me to heaven and let me fall down
Now that it's over
I'm gonna carry on!
Lifted me up, and watched me stumble
After the heartache...
I'm gonna carry on! Living for love!
I'm living for love!
I'm not giving up!
I'm gonna carry on! Living for love!
I'm living for love!
Not gonna stop!
'Cause love's gonna lift me up!
(Love!)
(Lift me up!) Love's gonna lift me up!
(Love!)
(Lift me up!) I could get caught up in bitterness
But I'm not dwelling on this crazy mess (Oh, yes!)
I found freedom in the ugly truth
I deserve the best and it's not you!
You've broken my heart
But you can't break me down! (Come on!)
Had fallen apart, what was lost has now been found
Picked up my crown, put it back on my head
I CAN FORGIVE, BUT I WILL NEVER FORGET! Took me to heaven and let me fall down
Now that it's over
I'm gonna carry on!
Lifted me up, and watched me stumble
After the heartache...
I'm gonna carry on! Living for love!
I'm living for love!
I'm not giving up!
I'm gonna carry on! Living for love!
I'm living for love!
Not gonna stop!
'Cause love's gonna lift me up! (Love!)
(Llift me up!) Love's gonna lift me up!
(Love!)
(Lift me up!) Love's gonna lift me up! (Lift me up! Lift me up! Lift me up!...)
'Cause love's gonna lift me Up! Up! Up! Up!
Love lift me Up! Up! Up! Up!
'Cause love's gonna lift me Up! Up! Up! Up!
Love lift me Up! Up! Up! Up!
Love's gonna lift me up! (Gonna lift me up!)
Love lift me Up! Up! Up! Up! Living for love!
Living for love!
I'm not giving up!
I'm gonna carry on!
Living for love!
I'm living for love!
Not gonna stop!
'Cause love's gonna lift me up!
(Love... Love... Love...) CHE
In June of 43 there was a military coup
Behind it was a gang called the G.O.U.
Who did not feel the need to be elected
They had themselves a party at the point of a gun
They were slightly to the right of Attila the Hun
A bomb or two and very few objected
Just one shell and governments fall like flies
Ka-pow, Die
They stumble and fall
Bye bye
Backs to the wall
Aim high
We're having a ball
The tank and bullet ruled as democracy dies
The lady's got potential
She was setting her sights
Of making it in movies
With her name in lights
The greatest social climber
Since Cinderella
Okay she couldn't act
But she had the right friends
And we all know a career depends
On knowing the right fella to be stellar.
Just one shell and governments lose their nerve
Ka-pow, Die
They stumble and fall
Bye, bye
Backs to the wall
Aim high
We're having a ball
That's how we get the government we deserve
Now the man behind the president
Calling the shots
Involved so discreetly in a lot of their plots was Colonel Juan Peron would-be dictator
He began in the army out in Italy so
Saw Mussolini's rise from the very front row
I reckon he'd do likewise sooner or later
Just one blast and the tear gas falls like rain
Ka-pow, Die
They haven't a chance
Bye bye
The terrorists advance
But one guy
Doesn't dirty his hands
Peron was biding time out in the slow lane.
Suddenly a earthquake hit the town of San Juan
Ka-pow, Die
They stumble and fall
Bye bye
Keep away from the wall
But one guy
Was having a ball
The tragedy a golden chance for Peron
He organized a concert with incredible flair
He named off all the victims such a grand affair Politicians, actors, stars of every flavor
It was January 22, 1944 A night to remember yeah that's for sure
For that's the night that Peron first met Eva
For that's the night that Peron first met Eva. Means I'm ready for...

Cherish is the word I used to remind me of your love Keep giving it, keep giving it to me Boy, keep giving me all, all of your joy
Give me faith, I will always cherish you Romeo and Juliet
They never felt this way, I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view I cherish the thought Of always having you here by my side

Boy, keep giving me all, all of your joy Cherish the love
Give me faith, give me joy
My boy, I will always cherish you Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know When you know the notes to sing, you can sing 'most anything
That's what my mama told me
'Round and 'round and 'round you go
When you find love, you'll always know
I let my father mold me Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you) That's why I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know, the deeper I go "All is fair in love", she said,
Think with your heart, not with your head
That's what my mama told me
All the little things you do will end up coming back to you
I let my father mold me Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you) That's why I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know Someone said that romance was dead
And I believed it instead of remembering what my mama told me
Let my father mold me, then you tried to hold me
You remind me of what they said
This feeling inside, I can't explain
But my love is alive and I'm never gonna hide it again Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you) That's why I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Never gonna hide it again
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
Never gonna have to pretend Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Never gonna hide it again
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
Never gonna have to pretend You got to just let your body move to the music
You got to just let your body go with the flow Falling in love, falling in love, falling in love
I can't keep from falling in love with you
You know there's nothing better that I'd like to do Lyrics: Is it the rain or is it the weather
Am I insane to wanna keep it together
Is it the moon that's affecting my brain
Is it my prayers that never made it to heaven I'm in love with love
Anyone can see
Angels up above are watching over me Is it the sunlight that changes the seasons
Monday through Sunday I'm looking for reasons
Is there an angel watching over my shoulder
Tricking my senses or giving me shelter I'm in love with love
Anyone can see
Angels up above are watching over me I'm in love with love
Is it the rain, is it the weather
Angels up above
Is it my prayers keeping us together Is it the rain or is it the weather
Am I insane to wanna keep it together
Is it the moon that's affecting my brain
Is it my prayers that never made it to heaven I'm in love with love
Anyone can see
Angels up above are watching over me I'm in love with love
Anyone can see
Angels up above are watching over me Affection is perfection
When it's done with ease
I'm in love with love I'm in love with love
Is it the rain or is it the weather
Angels up above
Is it my prayers keeping us together When the world starts to get you down
And nothing seems to go your way
And the noise of the maddening crowd
Makes you feel like you're going to go insane There's a glow of a distant light
Calling you to come outside
To feel the wind on your face and your skin
And it's here I begin my story Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Don't ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio It was time that I opened my eyes
I'm leaving the past behind
Nothing's ever what it seems
Including this time and this crazy dream I'm stuck like a moth to a flame
I'm so tired of playing this game
I don't know how I got to this state
Let me out of my cage cause I'm dying Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Don't ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Don't ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio I just wanna get in my car
I wanna go fast and I gotta go far
Don't ask me to explain how I feel
'Cause I don't want to say where I'm going Turn down the noise and turn up the volume
Don't have a choice cause the temperatures pounding
If leaving this place is the last thing I do
Then i want to escape with a person just like you Buzzin' around like a moth to a flame
I'm so sick and tired of playing this game
We gotta have fun if that's all that we do
Gotta shake up the system and break all the rules
Gotta turn up the radio until the speakers blow Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Don't ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
There's somethings you don't need to know
Just let me turn up the radio Turn up the radio
Just let me turn up the radio
Just let me turn up the radio O nae mamiya mamiya mami mamiya

Moduda moduda Hot Hot Hot [Justin Timberlake]: Who is the master? Who is the slave? 
Treat me like a curse, then tell me I'm your savior
I'm livin' with a stranger, I used to know so well
Waiting for your answer, is a kind of torture
Could I grow accustomed, to this kind of hell? Are you walking the dog, cause that dog isn't new
Are you outta control, is that dog walking you?
Haven't you had enough, now your time is up
Baby show me your hand Voices start to ring in your head, tell me what do they say?
Distant echoes from another time start to creep in your brain
So you've claim madness like it's convenient
You do it so often that you start to believe it
You have demons so nobody can blame you
But who is the master and who is the slave? First you say you'll love me, then you wanna leave me
Then you say you're sorry, you play the game so well
I bought your illusion, you're the greatest salesman
How could I refuse you when you sold it to yourself? Are you walking the dog, cause that dog isn't new
Are you outta control, is that dog walking you?
Haven't you had enough, now your time is up
Baby show me your hand Voices start to ring in your head, tell me what do they say?
Distant echoes from another time start to creep in your brain
So you've played 'round this, like it's convenient
You do it so often that you start to believe it
You have demons so nobody can blame you
But who is the master and who is the slave? A new argentina, the chains of the masses untied
A new argentina, the voice of the people
Cannot be denied
There is only one man who can lead any workers' regime
He lives for your problems, he shares your ideals and your dream
He supports you, for he loves you
Understands you, is one of you
If not, how could he love me?
A new argentina, the workers' battle song
A new argentina, the voice of the people
Rings out loud and long
Now I am a worker, I've suffered the way that you do
I've been unemployed, and I've starved and I've hated it too
But I found my salvation in peron, may the nation
Let him save them as he saved me
A new argentina, a new age about to begin
A new argentina, we face the world together
And no dissent within
There again we could be foolish not to quit while we're ahead
I can see us many miles away, inactive
Sipping cocktails on a terrace, taking breakfast in bed
Sleeping easy, doing nothing, it's attractive
Don't think I don't think like you
I often get those nightmares too
They always take some swallowing
Sometimes it's very difficult to keep momentum
If it's you that you are following
Don't close doors, keep an escape clause
Because we might lose the big apple
But would I have done what I did
If I hadn't thought, if I hadn't known
We would take the country
Peron has resigned from the army and this we avow
The descamisados are those he is marching with now
He supports you, for he loves you
Understands you, is one of you
If not, how could he love me?
A new argentina, the chains of the masses untied
A new argentina, the voice of the people
Cannot be, and must not be denied You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore
When you lived inside of me
There was nothin' I could conceive that you wouldn't do for me
Trouble seem so far away
You changed that right away
Baby
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore
Love don't live here anymore
Just emptiness and memories of what we had before
You went away
Found another place to stay
Another home
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
(love don't live here anymore)
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore
In the windmill of my eyes
Everyone can see the loneliness inside me
Why'd you have to go away?
(away)
Don't you know I miss you so
I need your love
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
(love don't live here anymore)
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Live here anymore
Don't live here anymore
(love don't live here anymore)
Don't live here anymore
No no
Don't, don't live here anymore
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
No, don't live here anymore
Love don't live (love don't live here anymore) here anymore
You don't live here anymore

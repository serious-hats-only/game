I am the son and the heir
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
I am the son and heir of nothing in particular
Oh, shut your mouth, how can you say
I go about things the wrong way
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does I am the son and the heir
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
I am the son and heir of nothing in particular Oh, shut your mouth, how can you say
I go about things the wrong way
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does There's a club if you'd like to go
You could meet somebody who really loves you
So you go and you stand on your own
And you leave on your own
And you go home and you cry and you want to die
When you say it's going to happen "now" Well, when exactly do you mean?
See I've already waited too long
And all my hope is gone
You shut your mouth how can you say
I go about things the wrong way
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
But heaven knows I'm miserable now I was looking for a job, and then I found a job
And heaven knows I'm miserable now In my life
Why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die? Two lovers entwined pass me by
And heaven knows I'm miserable now I was looking for a job, and then I found a job
And heaven knows I'm miserable now In my life
Oh, why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die? What she asked of me at the end of the day
Caligula would have blushed "You've been in the house too long" she said
And I (naturally) fled In my life
Why do I smile
At people who I'd much rather kick in the eye? I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
But heaven knows I'm miserable now "You've been in the house too long" she said
And I (naturally) fled In my life
Why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die? Panic on the streets of london
panic on the streets of birmingham
i wonder to myself
could life ever be sane again?
the leeds side-streets that you slip down
i wonder to myself
hopes may rise on the grasmere
but honey pie, you're not safe here
so you run down
to the safety of the town
but there's panic on the streets of carlisle
dublin, dundee, humberside
i wonder to myself
Burn down the disco
hang the blessed dj
because the music that they constantly play
it says nothing to me about my life
hang the blessed dj
because the music they constantly play on the leeds side-streets that you slip down
provincial towns you jog 'round

And why do you hang around ?
I'm so sorry

When you know it makes things hard for me ?
When you know, oh
Why do you come ?
Why do you telephone ? (Hmm...)
And why send me silly notes ?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry Why do you come here
When you know it makes things hard for me ?
When you know, oh
Why do you come ?
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
"It was just to see, just to see"
(All the things you knew I'd written about you...)
Oh, so many illustrations
Oh, but
I'm so very sickened
Oh, I am so sickened now Oh, it was a good lay, good lay
It was a good lay, good lay
It was a good lay, good lay
Oh
It was a good lay, good lay
It was a good lay, good lay
Oh, it was a good lay, good lay
Oh
Oh, it was a good lay
It was a good lay
Oh, a good lay
Oh, it was a good lay
Good lay, good lay
Oh
It was a good lay
It was a good lay Take me out tonight
Where there's music and there's people
Who are young and alive
Driving in your car
I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one
Anymore Take me out tonight
Because I want to see people
And I want to see life
Driving in your car
Oh please, don't drop me home
Because it's not my home, it's their home
And I'm welcome no more And if a double-decker bus
Crashes into us
To die by your side
Is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten ton truck
Kills the both of us
To die by your side
Well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine Take me out tonight
Take me anywhere
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care.
And in the darkened underpass
I thought: 'Oh God, my chance has come at last!'
But then a strange fear gripped me
And I just couldn't ask Take me out tonight
Oh take me anywhere
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care.
Driving in your car
I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one
Oh, I haven't got one And if a double-decker bus
Crashes into us
To die by your side
Is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten ton truck
Kills the both of us
To die by your side
Well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine Oh, there is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out... Oh mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
and as I climb into an empty bed
Oh well, enough said
I know it's over still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Oh... Oh mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
See, the sea wants to take me
the knife wants to slit me
Do you think you can help me? Sad veiled bride, please be happy
Handsome groom, give her room
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
although she needs you more than she loves you And I know it's over
still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
it's over, it's over, it's over I know it's over
and it never really began
but in my heart it was so real
and you even spoke to me and said: "If you're so funny
then why are you on your own tonight?
and if you're so clever
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so very entertaining
then why are you on your own tonight?
if you're so very good looking
why do you sleep alone tonight?
I know because tonight is just like any other night
that's why you're on your own tonight
with your triumphs and your charms
while they are in each other's arms" It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes strength to be gentle and kind
it's over, over, over It's so easy to laugh
it's so easy to hate
it takes guts to be gentle and kind
it's over, over, over Love is natural and real
but not for you, my love
not tonight my love
Love is natural and real
but not for such as you and I, my love Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head Good times for a change
See, the luck I've had
Can make a good man
Turn bad So please please please
Let me, let me, let me
Let me get what I want
This time Haven't had a dream in a long time
See, the life I've had
Can make a good man bad So for once in my life
Let me get what I want
Lord knows, it would be the first time
Lord knows, it would be the first time Sweetness
Sweetness I was only joking
When I said I'd like to
Smash every tooth In your head
Sweetness
Sweetness I was only joking
When I said by rights you
Should be Bludgeoned in your bed And now I know how Joan of Arc felt
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt
As the flames rose to her Roman nose
And her walkman started to melt Bigmouth
Bigmouth
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
To the Human race Bigmouth
Bigmouth
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
To the Human race And now I know how Joan of Arc felt

From doing all the things in life you'd like to
Shyness is nice, and shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life you'd like to So if there's something you'd like to try
If there's something you'd like to try
Ask me, I won't say no, how could I? Coyness is nice, and coyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life you'd like to So if there's something you'd like to try
If there's something you'd like to try
Ask me, I won't say no, how could I? Spending warm summer days indoors
Writing frightening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg
Ask me, ask me, ask me
Ask me, ask me, ask me
Because if it's not love
Then it's the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb
That will bring us together Nature is a language, can't you read?
Nature is a language, can't you read? So ask me, ask me, ask me
Ask me, ask me, ask me
Because if it's not love
Then it's the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb
That will bring us together
If it's not love
Then it's the bomb
Then it's the bomb that will bring us together
So ask me, ask me, ask me
Ask me, ask me, ask me, oh Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep
I'm tired and I
I want to go to bed Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep
And then leave me alone
Don't try to wake me in the morning
'Cause I will be gone
Don't feel bad for me
I want you to know
Deep in the cell of my heart I will feel so glad to go Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep I don't want to wake up
On my own anymore Sing to me
Sing to me
I don't want to wake up
On my own anymore
Don't feel bad for me

Deep in the cell of my heart
I really want to go
There is another world
There is a better world
Well, there must be
Well, there must be
Well, there must be
Well, there must be
Well ...
Bye bye
Bye bye
Bye ... Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know it's really serious There were times when I could have murdered her
But you know, I would hate anything to happen to her
No, I don't want to see her Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know it's serious
My, my, my, my, my, my baby
Goodbye There were times when I could have strangled her
But you know, I would hate anything to happen to her
Would you please let me see her? Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do Let me whisper my last goodbyes
I know it's serious From the ice-age to the dole-age
there is but one concern
i have just discovered:
Some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls' mothers are bigger than
other girls' mothers
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls' mothers are bigger than
other girls' mothers
as anthony said to cleopatra
as he opened a crate of ale:
oh, i say:
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls' mothers are bigger than
other girls' mothers
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls' mothers are bigger than
other girls' mothers
send me the pillow ...
the one that you dream on ...
send me the pillow ...
the one that you dream on ...
and i'll send you mine Belligerent ghouls
Run Manchester schools
Spineless swines
Cemented minds
Sir leads the troops
Jealous of youth
Same old suit since 1962
He does the military two-step
Down the nape of my neck
I want to go home
I don't want to stay
Give up education
As a bad mistake
Mid-week on the playing fields
Sir thwacks you on the knees
Knees you in the groin
Elbows in the face
Bruises bigger than dinner plates
I want to go home
I don't want to stay Belligerent ghouls
Run Manchester schools
Spineless bastards all
Sir leads the troops
Jealous of youth
Same old jokes since 1902
He does the military two-step
Down the nape of my neck
I want to go home
I don't want to stay
Give up life
As a bad mistake
"Please, excuse me from gym
I've got this terrible cold coming on"
He grabs and devours
He kicks me in the showers
Kicks me in the showers
And he grabs and devours
I want to go home
I don't want to stay At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
And oh, the plans they weave
And oh, the sickening greed At the record company party
On their hands - a dead star
The sycophantic slags all say:
"I knew him first, and I knew him well" Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
Double-pack with a photograph
Extra Track (and a tacky badge) A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them!"
(sadly, this was your life) But you could have said no
If you'd wanted to
You could have said no
If you'd wanted to BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them! Please them"
Sadly this was your life But you could have said no
If you'd wanted to
You could have walked away
Couldn't you? I touched you at the soundcheck
You had no real way of knowing
In my heart I begged "Take me with you...
I don't care where you're going..." But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
Just a child from those ugly new houses
Who could never begin to know Who could never really know
Oh... Best of! Most of!
Satiate the need!
Slip them into different sleeves
Buy both, and feel deceived Climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour
Media whore
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
This was your life... And when it fails, to recoup?
Well, maybe
You just haven't earned it yet, baby I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
You're just the same as I am
What makes most people feel happy
Leads us headlong into harm So, in my bedroom in those ugly new houses
I danced my legs down to the knees
But me and my true love
Will never meet again... At the record company meeting
On their hands at last a dead star
But they can never taint you in my eyes
No, they can never touch you now No, they cannot hurt you, my darling
They cannot touch you now
But me and my true love
Will never meet again I decree today that life
Is simply taking and not giving
England is mine - it owes me a living
But ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
Oh, ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
But we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
No, we cannot cling to those dreams Does the body rule the mind
Or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno... Under the iron bridge we kissed
And although I ended up with sore lips
It just wasn't like the old days anymore
No, it wasn't like those days
Am I still ill?
Oh ... Am I still ill?
Oh ...
Does the body rule the mind Or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...
Ask me why, and I'll die
Oh, ask me why, and I'll die
And if you must, go to work - tomorrow
Well, if I were you I really wouldn't bother
For there are brighter sides to life And I should know, because I've seen them
But not very often ...
Under the iron bridge we kissed
And although I ended up with sore lips
It just wasn't like the old days anymore
No, it wasn't like those days
Am I still ill?
Oh ...
Oh, am I still ill?
Oh ... Heifer whines could be human cries
Closer comes the screaming knife
This beautiful creature must die
This beautiful creature must die
A death for no reason
And death for no reason is murder
And the flesh you so fancifully fry
Is not succulent, tasty or kind
It's death for no reason
And death for no reason is murder
And the calf that you carve with a smile
It is murder
And the turkey you festively slice
It is murder
Do you know how animals die? Kitchen aromas aren't very homely
It's not comforting, cheery or kind
It's sizzling blood and the unholy stench of murder
It's not natural, normal or kind
The flesh you so fancifully fry
The meat in your mouth
As you savour the flavour of murder
No No No - It is Murder
No No No - It is Murder
And who hears when animals cry? I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
i am a man of means (of slender means)
each household appliance
is like a new science in my town
and if the day came when i felt a
natural emotion
i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump
in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound
no ...
it's such a sad thing
I'd like to drop my trousers to the queen
every sensible child will know what this means
the poor and the needy
are selfish and greedy on her terms
and if the day came when i felt a
natural emotion
i'd get such a shock i'd probably jump
in the ocean
and when a train goes by
it's such a sad sound
no ...
it's such a sad thing and when i'm lying in my bed
i think about life
and i think about death
and neither one particularly appeals to me
and if the day came when i felt a
natural emotion
i'd get such a shock i'd probably lie
in the middle of the street and die
i'd lie down and die ...
oh, oh All men have secrets and here is mine
So let it be known
For we have been through hell and high tide
I think I can rely on you
And yet you start to recoil
Heavy words are so lightly thrown
But still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you So, what difference does it make?
So, what difference does it make?
It makes none
But now you have gone
And you must be looking very old tonight The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
Because you asked me to!
But now you make me feel so ashamed
Because I've only got two hands
Well, I'm still fond of you So, what difference does it make?
Oh, what difference does it make?
Oh, it makes none
But now you have gone
And your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight Oh, the devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole, and then I lied
Just because you asked me to
But now you know the truth about me
You won't see me anymore
Well, I'm still fond of you But no more apologies
No more apologies
Oh, I'm too tired
I'm so sick and tired
And I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you Oh, my sacred one
Oh... Well I wonderDo you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry Well I wonder
Do you see me when we pass?
I half-die Please keep me in mind
please keep me in mind Gasping but somehow still alive
This is the fierce last stand of all I am Gasping, dying but somehow still alive
This is the final stand of all I am Please keep me in mind Farewell... to this land's cheerless marshes
Hemmed in like a boar between archers
Her very Lowness with her head in a sling
I'm truly sorry but it sounds like a wonderful thing
"I say, Charles, don't you ever crave
To appear on the front of the Daily Mail
Dressed in your mother's bridal veil?" And so I checked all the registered historical facts And I was shocked into shame to discover
How I'm the 18th pale descendant
Of some old queen or other
Oh has the world changed or have I changed?
Oh has the world changed or have I changed?
Some 9-year-old tough who peddles drugs
(I swear to God, I swear
I never even knew what drugs were)
So I broke into the Palace
With a sponge and a rusty spanner
She said: "Eh, I know and you cannot sing!"
I said: "That's nothing, you should hear me play piano!"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But when you're tied to your mother's apron
No one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
Like Love and Law and Poverty
These are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But the rain that flattens my hair
These are the things that kill me
All their lies about make-up and long hair, still there
Pass the pub who saps your body
And the church who'll snatch your money
The Queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the pub that wrecks your body And the church - all they want is your money The Queen is dead, boys And it's so lonely on a limb Life is very long when you're lonely
Life is very long when you're lonely
Life is very long when you're lonely
Life is very long when you're lonely The rain falls hard on a humdrum town
This town has dragged you down
Oh, the rain falls hard on a humdrum town
This town has dragged you down Oh, no and everybody's got to live their life
And God knows I've got to live mine
God knows I've got to live mine William, William, it was really nothing
William, William, it was really nothing
It was your life How can you stay with a fat girl who'll say
Oh, would you like to marry me?
And if you like you can buy the ring
She doesn't care about anything Would you like to marry me?
And if you like you can buy the ring
I don't dream about anyone except myself
Oh, William, William, it was really nothing
William, William, oh Stop me, oh oh oh stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before.
Stop me, oh oh oh stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before.
Nothing's changed
I still love you, oh I still love you...
only slightly less than I used to, my love
I was delayed, I was way-laid
An emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
And the pain was enough to make
A shy, bald Buddhist reflect
And plan a mass-murder
Who said I lied to her
Who said I'd lied because I never, I never
Who said I'd lied because I never
I was detained, I was restrained
He broke my knees
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
Who said I lied to her
Who said I'd lied because I never, I never
Who said I'd lied because I never
Stop me, oh oh oh stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before.
Stop me, oh oh oh stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before.
Nothing's changed
I still love you, oh I still love you...
only slightly, only slightly less than I used to, my love. A sad fact widely known
The most impassionate song
To a lonely soul
Is so easily outgrown But don't forget the songs
That made you smile
And the songs that made you cry When you lay in awe
On the bedroom floor
And said
"Oh, oh, smother me Mother" No, rubber ring, rubber ring
Rubber ring, rubber ring
Rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring No, rubber ring
Rubber ring, rubber ring The passing of time
And all of its crimes
Is making me sad again The passing of time
And all of its sickening crimes
Is making me sad again But don't forget the songs
That made you cry
And the songs that saved your life Yes, you're older now
And you're a clever swine
But they were the only ones
Who ever stood by you The passing of time
Leaves empty lives
Waiting to be filled The passing of time
Leaves empty lives
Waiting to be filled I'm here with the cause
I'm holding the torch
In the corner of your room
Can you hear me? And when you're dancing and laughing
And finally living
Hear my voice in your head
And think of me kindly No, rubber ring, rubber ring
Rubber ring, rubber ring
Rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring No, rubber ring
Rubber ring, rubber ring Do you love me like you used to?
Rubber ring, rubber ring
Rubber ring, rubber ring You're clever
Everybody's clever nowadays
You're clever
Everybody's clever nowadays You are sleeping
You do not want to believe
You are sleeping
You do not want to believe You are sleeping
You do not want to believe
You are sleeping The boy with the thorn in his side
Behind the hatred there lies
A murderous desire for love How can they look into my eyes
And still they don't believe me
How can they hear me say those words
And still they don't believe me
And if they don't believe me now
Will they ever believe me?
And if they don't believe me now
Will they ever believe me? The boy with the thorn in his side
Behind the hatred there lies
A plundering desire for love How can they see the love in our eyes
And still they don't believe us
And after all this time
They don't want to believe us
And if they don't believe us now
Will they ever believe us?
And when you want to live
How do you start?
Where do you go?
Who do you know? Last night I dreamt
That somebody loved me
No hope, no harm
Just another false alarm Last night I felt
Real arms around me
No hope, no harm
Just another false alarm So, tell me how long
Before the last one?
And tell me how long
Before the right one? The story is old - I know
But it goes on
The story is old - I know
But it goes on A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
While Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
All those people, all those lives
Where are they now?
With loves and hates
And passions just like mine
They were born
And then they lived
And then they died
Seems so unfair
I want to cry You say: "Ere thrice the sun hath done
salutation to the dawn"
And you claim these words as your own
But I've read well and I've heard them said
A hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
If you must write prose or poems
The words you use should be your own
Don't plagiarise or take 'on loan'
There's always someone, somewhere
With a big nose who knows
And who trips you up and laughs
When you fall
Who'll trip you up and laugh
When you fall You say: "Ere long done do does did"
Words which could only be your own
And then produce the text
From whence was ripped
'Some dizzy whore', 1804
A dreaded sunny day
So let's go where we're happy
And I meet you at the cemetry gates
Oh Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
So let's go where we're wanted
And I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
But you lose
'Cause weird lover Wilde is on mine
Sure! Oh hello
i am the ghost of troubled joe
hung by his pretty white neck
some eighteen months ago
i travelled to a mystical time zone
and i missed my bed
and i soon came home
They said:
"there's too much caffeine
in your bloodstream
and a lack of real spice
in your life" i said:
"leave me alone
because i'm alright, dad
surprised to still
be on my own..." oh, but don't mention love
i'd hate the strain of the pain again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so it shall be again
and people who are uglier than you and i
they take what they need, and just leave oh, but don't mention love
i'd hate the pain of the strain all over again
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so why can't it be now?
and people who are weaker than you or i
they take what they want from life oh, but don't mention love
no - no, don't mention love!
a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
your youth may be gone
but you're still a young man
so phone me, phone me, phone me

oh ... Call me morbid, call me pale
I've spent six years on your trail
Six long years on your trail Call me morbid, call me pale
I've spent six years on your trail
Six full years of my life
On your trail And if you have five seconds to spare
Then I'll tell you the story of my life:
Sixteen, clumsy and shy
I went to London and I
I booked myself in at Y.W.C.A.
I said: "I like it here - can I stay?
I like it here - can I stay?
Do you have a vacancy
For a back-scrubber?" She was left behind and sour
And she wrote to me on the hour
She said: "In the days when you were
Hopelessly poor, I just liked you more." And if you have five seconds to spare
Then I'll tell you the story of my life:
Sixteen, clumsy and shy
I went to London and I
I booked myself in at Y.W.C.A.
I said: "I like it here - can I stay?
I like it here - can I stay?
And do you have a vacancy
For a back-scrubber?" Call me morbid, call me pale
I've spent too long on your trail
Far too long, chasing your tail
And if you have five seconds to spare
Then I'll tell you the story of my life:
Sixteen, clumsy and shy
That's the story of my life
Sixteen, clumsy and shy
The story of my life That's the story of my life
That's the story of my life
That's the story of my life
The story of my life On the day that your mentality
Decides to try to catch up with your biology Come 'round 'cause I want the one I can't have
And it's driving me mad
It's all over, all over, all over my face On the day that your mentality
Catches up with your biology I want the one I can't have
And it's driving me mad
It's all over, all over, all over my face A double bed and a stalwart lover for sure
These are the riches of the poor
A double bed and a stalwart lover for sure
These are the riches of the poor And I want the one I can't have
And it's driving me mad
It's all over, all over my face A tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
Raised on prisoner's aid
He killed a policeman when he was thirteen
And somehow that really impressed me
But it's written all over my face Oh, these are the riches of the poor
These are the riches of the poor I want the one I can't have
And it's driving me mad
It's written all over my face On the day that your mentality
Catches up with your biology And if you ever need self-validation
Just meet me in the alley by the railway station
It's all over my face Oh...
I know I'm unloveable
You don't have to tell me
I don't have much in my life
But take it - it's yours
I don't have much in my life
But take it - it's yours
Oh... I know I'm unloveable
You don't have to tell me
Oh, message received
Loud and clear
Loud and clear
I don't have much in my life
But take it - it's yours I know I'm unloveable
You don't have to tell me
For message received
Loud and clear
Loud and clear
Message received
I don't have much in my life
But take it - it's yours I wear Black on the outside
'Cause Black is how I feel on the inside
I wear Black on the outside
'Cause Black is how I feel on the inside And if I seem a little strange
Well, that's because I am
If I seem a little strange
That's because I am But I know that you would like me
If only you could see me
If only you could meet me Oh...
I don't have much in my life
But take it - it's yours
I don't have much in my life
But take it - it's yours
Mmm...
Oh... Over the moor, take me to the moor
Dig a shallow grave
And I'll lay me down Lesley-Anne with your pretty white beads
Oh John you'll never be a man
And you'll never see your home again
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward see those alluring lights?
Tonight will be your very last night
A woman said: "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his sacred head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says
Hindley wakes. and says:
"Wherever he has gone I have gone"
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
Cannot hide the stolid stench of death
Fresh lilaced moorland fields
Cannot hide the stolid stench of death
Hindley wakes and Hindley says
Hindley wakes. and says:
"Oh whatever he has done I have done"
But this is no easy ride
For a child cries:
"Find me. find me, nothing more
We are on a sullen misty moor
We may be dead and we may be gone
But we will be, we will be. right by your side
Until the day you die!"
This is no easy ride
"We will haunt you when you laugh
Yes, you could say we're a team
You might sleep, you might sleep.
But you will never dream!"
"You might sleep but you will never dream!"
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
"Find me, find me, find me.
I'll haunt you when you laugh
You might sleep but you will never dream!" Over the moor, I'm on the moor
Over the moor
The child is on the moor Girl afraid
Where do his intentions lay?
Or does he even have any?
She says:
"He never really looks at me
I give him every opportunity
In the room downstairs
He sat and stared
In the room downstairs
He sat and stared I'll never make that mistake again!"
I'll never make that mistake again
I'll never make that mistake again
Boy afraid
Prudence never pays
And everything she wants costs money
"But she doesn't even LIKE me!
And I know because she said so
In the room downstairs
She sat and stared
In the room downstairs
She sat and stared
I'll never make that mistake again!" I would rather not go
Back to the old house I would rather not go
Back to the old house
There's too many
Bad memories
Too many memories
There When you cycled by
Here began all my dreams
The saddest thing I've ever seen
And you never knew
How much I really liked you
Because I never even told you
Oh and I meant to Are you still there
Or have you moved away?
Or have you moved away? I would love to go
Back to the old house
But I never will
I never will I never will JEANE
The low-life has lost its appeal
And I'm tired of walking these streets
To a room with its cupboard bare
JEANE
I'm not sure what happiness means
But I look in your eyes
And I know that it isn't there
We tried, we failed
We tried and we failed
We tried and we failed
We tried and we failed
We tried JEANE
There's ice on the sink where we bathe
So how can you call this a home
When you know it's a grave
But you still hope for ridding grace
As you tidy the place
But it will never be clean, JEANE
We tried, we failed
We tried and we failed
We tried and we failed
We tried and we failed
We tried Cash on the nail
It's just a fairy tale
And I don't believe in magic anymore, JEANE
But I think you know
I really think you know
I think you know the truth
JEANE No heavenly choir
Not for me and not for you
Because I think that you know
I really think you know
I think you know the truth
JEANE
That we tried and we failed
That we tried and we failed
We tried and we failed
We tried and we failed
Oh JEANE Oh! Take me back to dear old Blighty,
Put me on the train for London Town,
Take me anywhere,
Drop me anywhere,
Liverpool, Leeds or Birmingham
But I don't care,
I should like to see my ... I don't bless them
Farewell to this land's cheerless marshes
Hemmed in like a boar between arches
Her very Lowness with a head in a sling
I'm truly sorry - but it sounds like a wonderful thing I said Charles, don't you ever crave
To appear on the front of the Daily Mail
Dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?
Oh ...
And so, I checked all the registered historical facts
And I was shocked into shame to discover
How I'm the 18th pale descendant
Of some old queen or other Oh, has the world changed, or have I changed?
Oh has the world changed, or have I changed? Some 9-year old tough who peddles drugs
I swear to God
I swear: I never even knew what drugs were
Oh ...
So, I broke into the palace
With a sponge and a rusty spanner
She said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "That's nothing - you should hear me play piano" We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But when you're tied to your Mother's apron
No-one talks about castration
Oh ... We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
Like love and law and poverty
Oh, these are the things that kill me We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But the rain that flattens my hair ...
Oh, these are the things that kill me All their lies about make-up and long hair, are still there Past the Pub who saps your body
And the church who'll snatch your money
The Queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb
Past the Pub that wrecks your body
And the church - all they want is your money
The Queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb Life is very long, when you're lonely
Life is very long, when you're lonely
Life is very long, when you're lonely
Life is very long, when you're lonely Upon the sand, upon the bay
"There is a quick and easy way" you say
Before you illustrate
I'd rather state:
"I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am"
And sorrow's native son
He will not smile for anyone And pretty girls make graves
Oh... End of the pier, end of the bay
You tug my arm, and say:
"Give in to lust, give up to lust, oh
Heaven knows we'll soon be dust... " Oh, I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am And sorrow's native son
He will not rise for anyone And pretty girls make graves
Oh, really?
Oh... I could've been wild and I could've been free
But nature played this trick on me
She wants it now And she will not wait
But she's too rough and I'm too delicate
Then, on the sand
Another man, he takes her hand A smile lights up her face (and well, it would)
I lost my faith in womanhood
I lost my faith in womanhood
I lost my faith...
Oh...
Hand in glove...
The sun shines out of our behinds...
Oh... I left the North
I traveled South
I found a tiny house
And I can't help the way I feel
Oh yes, you can kick me
And you can punch me
And you can break my face
But you won't change the way I feel
'Cause I love you
And is it really so strange?
Oh is it really so strange?
Oh is it really so, really so strange?
I say no, you say yes
And you will change your mind I left the South
I traveled North
I got confused - I killed a horse
I can't help the way I feel
Oh yes, you can punch me
And you can butt me
And you can break my spine
But you won't change the way I feel
'Cause I love you
And is it really so strange?
Oh is it really so strange?
Oh is it really so, really so strange?
I say no, you say yes
And you will change your mind I left the North again
I traveled South again
And I got confused, I killed a nun
I can't help the way I feel
I can't help the way I feel
I can't help the way I feel
I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell
Why is the last mile the hardest mile?
My throat was dry with the sun in my eyes
And I realized, I realized
That I could never
I could never, never, never go back home again I won't share you, no
I won't share you
With the drive and ambition
The zeal I feel, this is my time The note I wrote as she read
She said, "Has the perrier gone
Straight to my head
Or is life sick and cruel, instead?" Yes
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no I won't share you, no
I won't share you
With the drive and the dreams inside
This is my time Life tends to come and go
That's okay as long as you know
Life tends to come and go
As long as you know
Know, know, know, know, know
Know, know, know, know I won't share you, no
I won't share you
With the drive and the dreams inside
This is my time I want the freedom and I want the guile
I want the freedom and the guile
Oh, life tends to come and go
As long as you know
Know, know, know, know
Know, know, know, know I won't share you
I won't share you
I'll see you somewhere
I'll see you sometime, darling Unruly boys

Of how you took a child

And you made him old
You made him old
Reel around the fountain
Slap me on the patio
I'll take it now Oh...
Fifteen minutes with you
Well, I wouldn't say no
Oh, people said that you were virtually dead
And they were so wrong
Fifteen minutes with you
Oh, well, I wouldn't say no
Oh, people said that you were easily led
And they were half-right
Oh, they ... oh, they were half-right, oh It's time the tale were told
Of how you took a child

Fifteen minutes with you
Oh, I wouldn't say no
Oh, people see no worth in you
I do.
Oh, I... oh, I do
Oh... I dreamt about you last night
And I fell out of bed twice
You can pin and mount me like a butterfly
But "take me to the haven of your bed"
Was something that you never said
Two lumps, please
You're the bee's knees
But so am I
Oh, meet me at the fountain
Shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Oh... Fifteen minutes with you
Oh, I wouldn't say no
Oh, people see no worth in you
Oh, but I do.
Fifteen minutes with you
Oh, no, I wouldn't say no
Oh, people see no worth in you
I do.
Oh, I... I do
Oh, I do
Oh, I do
Oh, I do I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
Because you're evil
And you lie
And if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(But I won't cry!) Loved and lost
and some may say:
"When usually it's Nothing
Surely you're happy
It should be this way?"
I say. "No, I'm gonna kill my dog
May the lines sag, the lines sag heavy
And deep tonight" I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
Because you're evil
And you lie
And if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(But I won't cry!) Loved and lost
and some may say:
"When usually it's Nothing
Surely you're happy
It should be this way?"
I say. "No"
And then I shoot myself
So drink, drink, drink
And be ill tonight
From the one you left behind
From the one you left behind
From the one you left behind
From the one you left behind
Behind, behind.
Oh unhappy birthday! Frankly, Mr. Shankly, this position I've held
It pays my way and it corrodes my soul
I want to leave, you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history Frankly, Mr. Shankly, I'm a sickening wreck
I've got the 21st Century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history Mr. Shankly
Fame, Fame, fatal Fame
It can play hideous tricks on the brain
But still I'd rather be famous Than righteous or holy, any day, any day, any day
But sometimes I'd feel more fulfilled
Making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to live and I want to love I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of
Frankly, Mr. Shankly, this position I've held
It pays my way and it corrodes my soul
Oh I didn't realise that you wrote poetry I didn't realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry, Mr. Shankly
Frankly, Mr. Shankly, since you ask
You are a flatulent pain in the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
Still I must speak frankly, Mr. Shankly
Oh give us yer money! Park the car at the side of the road
You should know
Time's tide will smother you
And I will too When you laugh about people
Who feel so very lonely
Their only desire is to die Well, I'm afraid
It doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh But that joke isn't funny anymore
It's too close to home
And it's too near the bone It's too close to home
And it's too near the bone
More than you'll ever know Kick them when they fall down
Kick them when they fall down
You kick them when they fall down
Kick them when they fall down You kick them when they fall down
Kick them when they fall down
You kick them when they fall down
Kick them when they fall down It was dark as I drove the point home
And on cold leather seats
Well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my face after all I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine, oh I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine
Happening in mine, happening in mine
Happening in mine, happening in mine I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now, now, now, it's happening in mine
Happening in mine, now, now I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine
Happening in mine, happening in mine
Happening in mine I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now, now, now, it's happening in mine
Mine, mine, mine, oh Smoke
Lingers 'round your fingers
Train
Heave on - to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time? You left
Your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad
Because you're leaving
But didn't you see the Jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision this time? You left
Your girlfriend on the platform
With this really ragged notion
That you'll return
But she knows
That when he goes
He really goes
And do you think you've made
The right decision this time? Hand in glove
The sun shines out of our behinds
No, it's not like any other love
This one is different because it's us
Hand in glove
We can go wherever we please
And everything depends upon
How near you stand to me
And if the people stare
Then the people stare
Oh I really don't know and I really don't care
It's not a shame, no Hand in glove
The Good People laugh
Yes, we may be hidden by rags
But we've something they'll never have
Hand in glove
The sun shines out of our behinds
Yes, we may be hidden by rags
But we've something they'll never have
And if the people stare
Then the people stare
Oh I really don't know and I really don't care It's not a shame, no So hand in glove, I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
For the Good Life is out there somewhere
So stay on my arms, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
Yes I know my luck too well And I'll probably never see you again
I'll probably never see you again
I'll probably never see you again In a river the color of lead
Immerse the baby's head
Wrap her up in the News Of The World
Dump her on a doorstep, girl This night has opened my eyes
And I will never sleep again
You kicked and cried like a bullied child
A grown man of twenty-five Oh, he said he'd cure your ills
But he didn't and he never will
Oh, save your life
Because you've only got one The dream has gone
But the baby is real
Oh, you did a good thing
She could have been a poet Or, she could have been a fool
Oh, you did a bad thing
And I'm not happy
And I'm not sad A shoeless child on a swing
Reminds you of your own again
She took away your troubles
Oh, but then again She left pain
So, please save your life
Because you've only got one
The dream has gone But the baby is real
Oh, you did a good thing
She could have been a poet
Or, she could have been a fool Oh, you did a bad thing
And I'm not happy
And I'm not sad
Oh... And I'm not happy
And I'm not sad
Oh...
And I'm not happy And I'm not sad Is it wrong to want to live on your own?
no, it's not wrong - but i must know
how can someone so young
sing words so sad?

throw your homework onto the fire

Please stay with your own kind
And I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
It's not time
It's not time
So, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I know I need hardly say
How much I love your casual way
Oh, but please put your tongue away
A little higher and we're well away
The dark nights are drawing in
And your humor is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
And "love" is just a miserable lie
You have destroyed my flower-like life
Not once - twice
You have corrupt my innocent mind
Not once - twice
I know the wind-swept mystical air
It means: I'd like to see your underwear
I recognize that mystical air
It means: I'd like to seize your underwear
What do we get for our trouble and pain?
Just a rented room in Whalley Range
What do we get for our trouble and pain?
...Whalley Range!
Into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her...
I need advice, I need advice
I need advice, I need advice
Nobody ever looks at me twice
Nobody ever looks at me twice
I'm just a country-mile behind
The world
I'm just a country-mile behind
The whole world
Oh oh, oh...
I'm just a country-mile behind
The world
I'm just a country-mile behind
The whole world
Oh oh, oh...
Take me when you go
Oh oh, oh...
Take me when you go
Oh oh, oh...
I need advice, I need advice instrumental What she said:
"how come someone hasn't noticed
that i'm dead
and decided to bury me?
god knows, i'm ready!"
la-la-la ... What she said was sad
but then, all the rejection she's had
to pretend to be happy
could only be idiocy
la-la-la ... what she said was not for the job or
lover that she never had
oh ...
no no no ... what she read
all heady books
she'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattooed boy from
birkenhead
to really really open her eyes) what she read
all heady books
she'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattooed boy from
birkenhead
to really really open her eyes) what she said:
"i smoke 'cos i'm hoping for an
early death
and i need to cling to something!" what she said:
"i smoke 'cos i'm hoping for an
early death
and i need to cling to something!"
no no no no ... All the streets are crammed with things
Eager to be held
I know what hands are for
And I'd like to help myself
You ask me the time
But I sense something more
And I would like to give you
What I think you're asking for
You, handsome devil
Oh you, handsome devil Let me get my hands
On your mammary glands
And let me get your head
On the conjugal bed
I say, I say, I say
I crack the whip
And you skip
But you deserve it
You deserve it A boy in the bush is worth two in the hand
I think I can help you get through your exams Oh you, handsome devil
Oh let me get my hands
On your mammary glands
And let me get your head
On the conjugal bed
I say, I say, I say
I crack the whip
And you skip
But you deserve it
You deserve it And when you're in your scholarly room
Who will swallow whom You, handsome devil
Let me get my hands
On your mammary glands
And let me get your head
On the conjugal bed
I say, I say, I say There's more to life than books, you know
But not much more
There's more to life than books, you know
But not much more
Not much more Oh you, handsome devil The lanes were silent
There was nothing, no one, nothing around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
With a hard-faced, three-word gesture I started something, I forced you to a zone
And you were clearly never meant to go
Hair brushed and parted typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something and now I'm not too sure I grabbed you by guilded beams
Uh, that's what tradition means
And I doused another venture with a gesture
That was absolutely vile I started something, I forced you to a zone
And you were clearly never meant to go
Hair brushed and parted typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something and now I'm not too sure I grabbed you by guilded beams
Uh, that's what tradition means
And now eighteen months' hard labor
Seems fair enough I started something and I forced you to a zone
And you were clearly never meant to go
Hair brushed and parted typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something and now I'm not too sure I started something, I started something
Typical me, typical me, typical me, typical me
Typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something and now I'm not too sure Okay, Stephen? Do that again? Here her head she lay
Until she'd rise and say
"I'm starved of mirth
Let's go and trip a dwarf" Oh, what to be done with her?
Oh, what to be done with her?
Oh Ice water for blood
With neither heart or spine
And then just to pass time
Let us go and rob the blind What to be done with her?
I ask myself
What to be said of her?
Oh But when she calls me
I do not walk, I run
Oh, when she calls
I do not walk, I run, oh, oh, oh Young bones groan and the rocks below say
"Throw your skinny body down, son" But I'm going to meet the one I love
So please don't stand in my way
Because I'm going to meet the one I love
No, Mama, let me go Young bones groan and the rocks below say
"Throw your white body down" But I'm going to meet the one I love
At last, at last, at last
I'm going to meet the one I love
La de da, la de da
No, Mama, let me go No, no, no I thought that if you had an acoustic guitar
Then it meant that you were a protest singer
Oh, I can smile about it now but at the time it was terrible
No, Mama, let me go No, no, no I was minding my business
Lifting some lead off
The roof of the Holy Name church
It was worthwhile living a laughable life
To set my eyes on the blistering sight
Of a vicar in a tutu
He's not strange
He just wants to live his life this way A scanty bit of a thing
Covered with a decorative ring
Wouldn't cover the head of a goose
As Rose collects the money in the cannister
Who comes sliding down the bannister?
Vicar in a tutu
He's not strange
He just wants to live his life this way The monkish monsignor
With a head full of plaster
Said: "My man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned!"
As Rose counts the money in the cannister
As natural as Rain
And he dances again, my God
Vicar in a tutu. The next day in the pulpit
With Freedom and Ease
Combatting ignorance, dust with disease
As Rose counts the money in the cannister
As natural as Rain
And he dances again and again.
With a fabric of a tutu
Any man could get used to
And I am the living sign And I'm a living sign
I'm a living sign. As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
Back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
You've got everything now
And what a terrible mess I've made of my life
Oh, what a mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
Because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
But I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say ... oh
You are your mother's only son
And you're a desperate one
Oh ...
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen ... oh ... in the back of your car
A friendship sadly lost?
Well this is true ... and yet, it's false
Oh ... But did I ever tell you, by the way?
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
You've got everything now
And what a terrible mess I've made of my life
Oh, what a mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
Because I'm too shy
I've seen you smile
But I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say ... oh
Oh ...
You are your mother's only son
And you're a desperate one
Oh ...
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied ... oh ... to the back of your car
To the back of your car
To the back of your car
To the back of your car
To the back of your car
To the back of your car
Oh ... Take me out tonight
Where there's music and there's people
And they're young and alive
Driving in your car
I never never want to go home
Because I haven't got one
Anymore
Take me out tonight
Because I want to see people and I Want to see life
Driving in your car
Oh, please don't drop me home
Because it's not my home, it's their Home, 
and I'm welcome no more
And if a double-decker bus
Crashes into us
To die by your side
Is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten-ton truck
Kills the both of us
To die by your side
Well, the pleasure - the privilege is mine
Take me out tonight
Take me anywhere, I don't care I don't care, I don't care
And in the darkened underpass I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
(But then a strange fear gripped me and I Just couldn't ask)
Take me out tonight
Oh, take me anywhere,
I don't care I don't care, I don't care
Driving in your car
I never never want to go home
Because I haven't got one, da ...Oh, 
I haven't got one And if a double-decker bus
Crashes into us
To die by your side
Is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten-ton truck
Kills the both of us
To die by your side
Well, the pleasure - the privilege is mine Oh, There Is A Light And It Never Goes Out
There Is A Light And It Never Goes Out
There Is A Light And It Never Goes Out
There Is A Light And It Never Goes Out
There Is A Light And It Never Goes Out
There Is A Light And It Never Goes Out
There Is A Light And It Never Goes Out
There Is A Light And It Never Goes Out
There Is A Light And It Never Goes Out Loving you is driving me crazy
People say that you were born lazy
'Cause you say that
Work Is A Four-Letter Word So change your life
There is so much I know
That you can do
Come and see... Wide-awake
And take all of this love
That is waiting for you If you stay
I'll stay right beside you
And my love
May help to remind you
To forget that
Work Is A Four-Letter Word I don't need
A house that's a showplace
I just feel
That we're going no place
While you say that
Work Is A Four-Letter Word So change your life
There is so much I know
You can do
Come and see... Wide-awake
And take all of this love
That is waiting for you If you stay
I'll stay right beside you
And my love
Might help to remind you
To forget that
Work Is A Four-Letter Word
Oh... I don't need
A house that's a showplace
I just feel
That we're going no place
While you say that
Work Is A Four-Letter Word So change your life
There is so much I know
That you can do
Please come and see... Wide-awake
And take all of this love
That is waiting for you Bought on stolen wine
A nod was the first step
You knew very well
What was coming next Bought on stolen wine
A nod was the first step
You knew very well
What was coming next Did I really walk all this way
Just to hear you say
Oh, I don't want to go out tonight
Oh, I don't want to go out tonight Oh, but you will, for you must
I don't owe you anything, no
But you owe me something
Repay me now You should never go to them
Let them come to you
Just like I do
Just like I do You should not go to them
Let them come to you
Just like I do
Just like I do Did I really walk all this way
Just to hear you say
Oh, I don't want to go out tonight
Oh, I don't want to go out tonight But you will, for you must
I don't owe you anything, no
But you owe me something
Repay me now Too freely on your lips
Words prematurely sad
Oh, but I know what will make you smile tonight Life is never kind
Life is never kind
Oh, but I know what will make you smile tonight The last night of the fair
By the big wheel generator
A boy is stabbed
And his money is grabbed
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
She is famous
She is funny
An engagement ring
Doesn't mean a thing
To a mind consumed by brass (money)
And though I walk home alone
(I might walk home alone)
But my faith in love is still devout
The last night of the fair
From a seat on a whirling waltzer
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
And though I walk home alone
(I might walk home alone)
But my faith in love is still devout
Then someone falls in love
And someone's beaten up
Someone's beaten up
And the senses being dulled are mine
And someone falls in love
Then someone's beaten up
Someone's beaten up
And the senses being dulled are mine
And though I walk home alone
(I might walk home alone)
But my faith in love is still devout
This is the last night of the fair
And the grease in the hair
Of a speedway operator
Is all a tremulous heart requires
A schoolgirl is denied
She said: "How quickly would I die
If I jumped from the top of the parachute?"
This is the last night of the fair
And the grease in the hair
Of a speedway operator
Is all a tremulous heart requires
A schoolgirl is denied
She said: "How quickly would I die
If I jumped from the top of the parachute?"
So scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen
This means you really love me
Scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen
This means you really love me
And though I walk home alone
(I just might walk home alone)
But my faith in love is still devout
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout On the high-rise estate
What's at the back of your mind?
Oh, a three-day debate
On a high-rise estate
What's at the back of your mind? Two icy-cold hands conducting the way
It's the Eskimo blood in my veins
Amid concrete and clay
And general decay
Nature must still find a way
So ignore all the codes of the day
Let your juvenile influences sway
This way and that way (this way)
This way and that way (this way)
God, how sex implores you
To let yourself lose yourself Stretch out and wait
Stretch out and wait
Oh... let your puny body, lie down, lie down
As we lie, you say
As we lie, you say
Stretch out and...
Stretch out and wait
Stretch out and wait
Oh... let your puny body lie down, lie down As we lie, you say :
Will the world end in the night time?
(I really don't know)
Or will the world end in the day time?
(I really don't know)
And is there any point ever having children?
Oh, I don't know
What I do know is we're Here and it's Now So... stretch out and wait
Stretch out and wait
There is no debate, no debate, no debate
How can you conciously contemplate
When there's no debate, no debate?
Stretch out and wait
Stretch out and wait
Stretch out and wait
Wait
Wait
Wait
Wait Hate, Love and War
Force emotions to the fore
But not for me of course, of course
I KEEP MINE hidden I KEEP MINE hidden
But it's so easy for you
Because you let yours flail
Into public view Yellow and green, a stumbling block
I'm a twenty-digit combination to unlock
With a past where to be touched
Meant to be mental I KEEP MINE hidden
The lies are so easy for you
Because you let yours slide
Into public view (Use your loaf!) When you walk without ease
On these streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
It lasted 20 years, 7 months and 27 days
And I know alone that I never, ever oh
Had no one ever Now I'm outside your house
I'm alone
And I'm outside your house
I hate to intrude Oh, I'm alone, I'm alone
I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone And I never, never oh
Had no one ever
I never had no one ever
I never had no, no one ever
Had no one never
never, no, oh Winter's almost gone,
Oh how I've waited so long
For summer nights.
When there's magic in the air
And I don't have a care,
All that matters to me
Is that you are here
On summer nights. There's a little cafe
Where we can hear music play.
They keep the lights turned down low
It's a place where lovers go.
There you'll hold me tight and say
Our love will always be this way
On summer nights. At the end of the day
We can go down to the bay
And together hand in hand
We will walk along the sand
On summer nights. In our little cafe
We'll dance the night away
And we know our love will be
Always true eternally. And when the moon begins to shine
I can see that you are mine
On summer nights. On summer nights.
On summer nights. Oh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Oh Glenn, oh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Oh Glenn, because there's somebody here who really, really loves you
Oh Glenn, stay home, be bored, it's crap, I know tonight Oh Glenn, oh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Oh Glenn, oh Glenn, don't come to the house tonight
Because there's somebody here who'll take a hatchet to your ear
The frustration it renders me hateful, Glenn Don't come to the house tonight
Don't come to the house tonight
Because you'll slip on the trail of my sad remains
That's why, that's why Goodbye my love, goodbye my love
Goodbye my love, goodbye my love
Goodbye my love, goodbye my love Mine eyes have seen the glory
Of the sacred wunder-kind
You took me behind a dis-used railway line
And said: "I know a place where we can go
Where we are not known"
And you gave me something that I won't forget too soon But I can't believe you'd ever care
And this is why you will never care These things take time
I know that I'm
The most inept
That ever stepped I'm spellbound but a woman divides
And the hills are alive with celibate cries
But you know where you came from
You know where you're going
And you know where you belong
You said I was ill and you were not wrong But I can't believe you'd ever care
And this is why you will never care These things take time
I know that I'm
The most inept
That ever stepped Oh the alcoholic afternoons
When we sat in your room
They meant more to me
Than any, than any living thing on earth
They had more worth
Than any living thing on earth Vivid and in your prime
You will leave me behind You will leave me behind instrumental Everyday you must say:
"So how do I feel about my life?"
Anything is hard to find
When you will not open your eyes
When will you accept yourself?
I am sick and I am dull and I am plain
How dearly I'd love to get carried away
Oh but dreams have a knack of just not coming true
And time is against me now Oh who and what to blame
Anything is hard to find
When you will not open your eyes
When will you accept yourself, for heaven's sake?
Anything is hard to find
When you will not open your eyes Everyday you must say
"Oh how do I feel about the past?"
Others conquered love but I ran
I sat in my room and I drew up a plan
Oh but plans can fall through as so often they do
And time is against me now And there's no one left to blame
Tell me when will you
When will you accept your life?
The one that you hate
For anything is hard to find
When you will not open your eyes Everyday you must say:
"Oh how do I feel about my shoes?"
They make me awkward and plain
How dearly I would love to kick with the fray
But I once had a dream and it never came true
And time is against me now
Time is against me now And there's no one but yourself to blame
Anything is hard to find
When you will not open your eyes
Anything is hard to find, for heaven's sake? Anything is hard to find
When you will not open your eyes
When will you accept yourself?
When...? Oh, the nights are too long
When the questions are long
I tried, but I will never understand
What Do You See In Him?
What Do You See In Him?
Oh ... She's the lifeblood of me
As you walk hand in hand
And I try, and I try, and I try
But I will never understand
Oh, What Do You See In Him?
I ask myself:-
What Do You See In Him?
Oh ... 
But she will plague you and I will be glad
Yes, she will plague you and I will be glad
Oh ...
Oh ... An instrumental song At last it's over,
I knew I could not hold him,
His love for freedom
Was far too strong. But though he's gone now
My life is just beginning,
I'll soon forget him,
I'll soon forget him,
I must forget him, Lord! Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la,
There's a brand new day beginning.
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la,
There's a brand new love that waits for me. Will I remember,
Will I still hear him whisper ?
Will I still feel his
Lips on mine ? In dreams I see him,
Perhaps he'll stay forever
And all I'm wishing
And all I'm hoping
And all my longing, too. Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la,
There's a brand new day beginning.
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la,
There's a brand new love that waits for me. He made me happy
And though I suffered, too,
There's no mistaking
Our love was true. But such a sweet love
Just wasn't meant to be
And it's all over
Yes, it's all over,
And now it's done I'll start anew. Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la,
There's a brand new day beginning.
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la,
There's a brand new love beginning. Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la,
There's a brand new day beginning.
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la,
There's a brand new love beginning.

Holding my own hand, walking all alone down a road
Holding my own hand, feeling the tips of my ears getting cold
A bell rings as a ghost walks up beside me, with a face like mine
And tells me that I won't always be lonely, it just takes a little time I wanted you, but you didn't want me...
Good Lord, Heaven knows I'm bad with love
I wanted you, but you didn't want me...
Good Lord, Heaven knows I've been banged up Oh, my sister, dead men are singing on the radio
Oh, my sister, it's all they ever seem to play anymore
A bell rings as I walk into a hotel, nobody's inside
A purple cat comes floating down the stairwell
With his blue eyes shining bright, suddenly I feel alright...lookout
I wanted you, but you didn't want me...
Good Lord, Heaven knows I'm bad with love
I wanted you, but you didn't want me...
Good Lord, Heaven knows I've been banged up Watching the garden grow, happy, happy days
Got egg yolk on my bed, Chinese food on the way
Watching the garden grow, straight into the sky
Got a candle by my window, it keeps me warm at night Spending time together,
watch out, don't let it?
Nothing is forever that's right,
but don't let it get you down And I'm sitting in the back of a limousine, just going to a show
Wishing you were here right next to me, aw, but you already know That I'm the one who loves ya,
watch out, don't let it get you down
And there will be no other,
that's right, don't let it get you down Watching the garden grow, such a beautiful day
It's raining through the window but I like it that way
Watching the garden grow the color of your eyes
Is changing with the season and God only knows why Spending time together, watch out, don't let it get you down
Nothing is forever, that's right, but don't let it get you down
Alright, get yo rave on! Yeah!
Run out by mama, and every girl just gives me drama.
All my friends are looking older, but you still look the same.
And I'm standing by the corner; I see you walking on by.
Asking if I'm doing fine, like you're some friend of mine. Oh, you must have lost track of time.
And yes I got your letter. I didn't think they wrote those anymore.
And no, I ain't feeling much better, but I ain't still feeling so sore.
Nobody told me, that being lonely, was fucking horrible too.
I'll be your brother, I'll be your sister.
I'll show you everything new. I'll show you everything new. It's raining in Chicago.
The rain drops on my window.
It's been a while since we've spoken.
I guess my doorbell must be broken.
And I'm spending all my money. I've got to get some luck on my side.
Driving in the rain, early in the morning, with the sun rising up in the sky.
You ain't from 'round here. Why'd you come down here?
Must be a long way from home.
Forget the distance. It don't mean nothing. You're calling me from the phone.
You only call when I'm gone. Oh, it's such a butterfly feeling
To have you for a friend
But somehow I get the feeling
That I'll be lonely again And in a little while I'll be gone
And in a little while I'll be gone
It only takes a little while to get along
So, come on baby, give a smile and come on And when the zombies started singin' bout the season
You know your daddy got up to dance
and it wasn't for any other reason
Than the feeling in his corduroy pants And in a little while daddy's gone,
And in a little while there goes mom!
It only takes a little while to get along
So, come on baby, give a smile and come on,
Oh, yeah! And in a little while I'll be gone
And in a little while I'll be gone
It only takes a little while to get along

So, come on baby, give a smile and come on When I woke up this morning in a cold sweat
That was telling me to follow this cue
Well I woke up this morning with a regret
Of not spending the night with you
And I look around my bed
And saw the [?]
And I sthe thoughts of you from my head
And in the shower started singing a tune
No I don't feel too sad, but I could
No I don't feel too bad now darling, but I sure could
But I don't
And you better bet that I won't
When a girl came walking on by
I smiled and I nodded hello
And she screamed and she [?] nearly tore out my eyes and started dancing when I fell to the floor
And I woke up in my bed
And saw the [?]
And I sthe thoughts of love from my head
And in the shower started singing a tune
No I don't feel too sad you know, but I could
No I don't feel too bad now darling, but I sure could
But I don't
And you better bet that I won't You can do it
It's all the same
Your eyes are big
You're counting the days No matter what time is
I'm out of reach
But for me you can be smoking weed It's right here in my hand
Trying to reach for my knees
You know by yourself
Waking up and wishing you were somebody else Amazing dream about '
We aren't joking around
I thought we were friends
We weren't so close
But we didn't have to fade away Day turns to night when all is said and done
I guess I wanted to be the lonely one
When I looked up, I've got your thoughts on my mind
Don't dim the lights until I've faded intuitions blind ()
Oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh (2)
Some call it strange, it's just a frame of mind
I never said that was ideal don't mean it ain't sublime
Beneath the moon, beyond the rising sun
And as the stars come we'll have some fun ()
Oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh (3)
And it gets dark
Though I don't know why
Can't seem to think alright
Just wish that you'd come by-I-I-I-I-I
Oh, oh Do you feel like you're on the run?
Are you scared because the road is long?
Well you're my kin, my son, you're not the only one
Do you feel like life is crushing you?
Get to scratching where it itches, keep your goals in view
Reserve your judgments too, that shit will bury you
I know you feel like a lesser man
Bet the winds hitting different on your hand
But what's a grain of sand to this entire land
Keep walk walk walkin' 'til your feet get sore
I see you hiding all your problems at the liquor store
This life's a major award, what you gonna trade that for? Well what ya doing baby, in the snow?
You know you're groovy but you move too slow
And when you're crazier, how it shows
You're just a smoothie with a heart made of gold Well what ya doing baby, in the snow?
You're just a groovy baby, in the snow
Strawberry smoothie baby, in the snow
Oh uh oh oh In the blizzard honey, you're a hound
You're headed nowhere with eyes glued to the ground
So pick your head up honey, look around!
Go pick your pieces all from lost and found Well what ya doing baby, in the snow?
You're just a groovy baby, in the snow
Strawberry smoothie baby, in the snow
Oh uh oh oh
Oh uh oh oh Oh, Seems there's no way out
Of a mind so fixed on it's doubts
When the walls are all torn down
Mind is free without reasons to frown Lost my company
All alone again
Felt so lonenly
Looked forward to the end Wore a five ton mask
Wile it dragged me closer to death
Seen it all insane
'til i put on a fresh set of frames I knew practically nothing
I was a wasted man too scared to really feel
But with a grasp onto something
It's such a bliss to finally glimpse something
So real
I was running from nothing but a good view Seems there's no way out
Of a mind so fixed on it's doubts
When i'm almost there
I don't know if i feel like i care I knew practically nothing
I was a wasted man too scared to really feel
But with a grasp onto something
It's such a bliss to finally glimpse something
So real
I was running for nothing but a good view well i'll do what you want to do for you ... I wonder why
I remember pain on a whim but now I can't seem to shake this smile
Wear a gilded in grin all the while for I know I'll need her
All of the time I wonder how
Grandmother's touch wasn't enough to stick around
But the trouble I found
Fades steady now from brown? for I know I'll need her
All of the time Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh Talking Well, I, I'll never let her go, she's not like them
And never has she been just one of those people
Ordinary people Everywhere i go its like you're there somehow
Everything I know can replace with you right now
I don't care about paying the rent if you don't
Ow, Ow
Nu nu nu nunu nu .
Every time I sleep I dream about you again
I lose track of my feet when i think about you my friend
I don't care about pennies or friends if you don't
But i wanna be yours, I wanna be yours
I wanna be bored of you if you're bored of me Everything I own I made it all yours
Though I try [?]
I don't care about sharing the lane if you don't
Nu nu nu nunu nu .
Are you feeling free do you ever feel down sometimes
Do you think of me in my [?]
I you don't care about a goddamn thing then I dont
But i wanna be yours, I wanna be yours
I wanna be bored of you if you're bored of me I heard the ringing on the telephone
Set aside a dream and we were on our own
I can't seem to understand
A word came through from the other end
And now I would lie to you alone I heard the ringing on the telephone
I heard you ringing on the telephone
I can't seem to understand
A word you've said since you've been gone
But I keep hanging on, oh oh I went out to the wasteland, had no means or end
I got brains, but the quake man, need love to lend a hand
I went out to the wastes, man
Looking for a friend and when you leave for your own plans
I hope that this don't end... Walking by myself
On my way home
Put me on the shelf
Leave me at home I said I don't care much what we talk about
When you hold me real tight I don't have a doubt
I talk a lot of noise because I think too much
Don't look down it's old enough to grow
So please hold on Walking by myself
On my way home
Put me on the shelf
Leave me at home I don't care much what we talk about
When you hold me real tight I don't have a doubt
I talk a lot of noise because I think too much
Don't look down it's old enough to grow
So please hold on You got me feelin' so lucky and I hope that you fuck me
I hope that you love me cause I'd rather be
Ain't that my fuckin' problem man these girls won't make you happy
She said tell me something, a couple of stories
All the girls that broke me they were nothing like you
I guess I learned my lesson, got taught once
Don't be a fucking pussy, that's what she told me Bye, bye, bye
Bop bop bop badap bop pop
Bye, bye, bye
Bop bop bop badap bop pop I'm such a loser, my friends knew I'd lose her
I wake up with bruises cause now I'm a boozer
I had a lot of problems way before I knew her
And I'm feeling so scummy, I hope that you call me
I'll tell everybody that I'm no longer lonely
You don't have to be crazy, you did that once
Don't be a fucking phony, that's what she told me Bye, bye, bye
Bop bop bop badap bop pop
Bye, bye, bye
Bop bop bop badap bop pop, oh, oh I know it's wrong for loving you too long
girl, that's on me
I know it's wrong for loving you too long
girl, that's on me
I know it's wrong for loving you too long
I wrote you all these songs I'll never sing
I know it's wrong for loving you too long For coming on too strong, girl, that's not me I will let you walk to the one you love
But who is the one you love?
Oh tell me who is the one you love? Who when bashed and bruised will tend your wounds?
Who will aid you with their point of view?
Oh tell me who is the one you love? I would hate to see you walk away
But I won't cry or beg for you to stay If you would use the one you love
You're gonna lose the one you love Who will take you down to up above?
Who will greet you with that amber glow?
Oh, tell me who is the one you love? I would hate to see you walk away
But I won't cry or beg for you to stay If you use the one you love
You're gonna lose the one you love I will let you walk to the one you love Low Lisa, always lies
Drab diva with a tongue-tied mind
But so sweet when her eyes are alive
I oughta tell her how much she means Low Lisa, men's shirt
Red sleeves and hands thick with dirt
She'll be laughing in a leather skirt
I oughta tell her how much she means All she wanted to be
All she wanted to see
All they want her to be
All they want to do Low Lisa in a lonely spot
Racing time with a mind distraugh
Lord knows that she's got to stop
I wanna tell her how much she means All she wanted to be
All she wanted to see
All they want her to be
All they want to do I wanna tell her that a winner ain't no joke
That something she's been thinking that instead
She's gotta know
But she keeps on speaking, her luck starts sinking
low, nowhere to go
I wanna tell her Irene would you tell me what you see?
Irene would you tell me what you see?
This it's my world, would you tell me what you see?
'would you tell me what you see?
Irene would you tell me what you see?
Irene would you tell me what you see?
This it's my world, '
Now it's my world, would you tell me what you see? When I look in the mirror of time
often find that I'm doing it over
but when I look at the tears from her eyes
don't regret a single word that I've told her When we're distant
I'm sure you'll think things over
I hope you'll miss it
but I'll still have an open shoulder
for you to lean and laugh and cry on, little girl How I wish that the start of the end would begin
That she'd need all that I've shown her
I know the cycle of life could begin
and in time I'd be stuck starting over With the distance
I hope faith don't roll over
If you don't miss it
I'll still have an open shoulder
for you to lean and laugh and cry on, little girl Why does love have to end?
Why do hearts have to break and mend?
Why do they tell me you won't be the only one?
They don't believe that love can last forever
Do you believe that love can last forever?
I believe that love can last forever
Do you believe that love can last forever?
I believe that love can last forever Take it, I'll give up the invention
In a strange world where each of us run to it
Drenching it in silent treat Oh, I long the space to breathe
I open up my eyes and see a strange country?
The world we silent sleep Oh, I long the little space to breathe I found a new way
To open up my mind
I'd love to tell you 'bout it, honey
If you could find the time And I can see the future
I can see the weather change
I can see from here to L.A.
And I know that everywhere's the same I FOUND A WAY
I FOUND A WAY I found a new way
To open up the day
All you gotta do is follow me through
And I know that you'll be ok And I found a new way
To open up my mind
All you gotta do is follow me through
And I know that you'll be fine I FOUND A WAY
I FOUND A WAY I found a new way
A new way to see
Just come over here and give me your ear
Let me tell you how good it could be I can see the future
I can see the weather change
I can see from here to New York City
And I know that every place is the same I FOUND A WAY
I FOUND A WAY I see the dark sky coming
I know it's on its way I was born not breathing
Since I've woke up everyday
Oh, and I, I can't even believe it
The victims of the U.S.A.
They all keep talkin' but got nothin' to say
It had me seizing up and so the season's up Flavor your heart and your soul
Flavor your heart and your soul
Flavor your heart I searched and drifted and grieved, man
Just trying to decide who to be
Oh, and I took the seat by the sea and
I laid beneath the evergreen trees
And I decided I'd just try to be me
And I stopped seizing up and so the season's up Flavor your heart and your soul
Flavor your heart and your soul
Flavor your heart Long way home, my boys, long way home
90 miles down the fuckin' street with my friends, my boys
It's a long way home
Long way home, my boys, long way home
90 miles down the fuckin' and I'm stoned, my boys
It's a long way home
Well this trip is long
How did it get so long?
Remember what you promised them... Long way home, long way home
90 miles an hour down the fucking road and I'm stoned, with my boys
It's a long way home
Long way home, long way home
90 miles an hour down the fucking street with my team, my boys
Well it's been so long since you said so long
Remember what you promised them Oh, Save me
from such a sad, sad song
I'm leaning on a lamppost,
I'm melting in the sun My toes are dripping through the sewer
I can feel my heart beating
as the tears roll down my tongue And as the nights been getting cooler
Never thought that you'd be leaving
Should've known that I'd be wrong Goodbye baby,
and the music starts to fade
Goodbye baby,
I really wish you could have stayed Holding roses in my hand
Moonlight reflecting off my tooth
A man will do all that he can,
just to be getting over you
And when the sadness lingers with its hand on my shoulder
Well you know it's been there before
And as the wind blows through my fingers
It feels like I'm getting older every time I turn a door Goodbye baby,
and the curtain starts to sway
Goodbye baby,
I really wish you could have stayed Baby, I've been thinking all about you lately
With the way you're looking who could really blame me?
Oh baby, oh darling
Of all the other girls I could be callin'
That phone of yours is ringing off the wall and
Oh oh oh darling, oh darling You're such a sweet, sweet thing
You're sweeter and you're colder than a frozen tangerine
Thinking when I'm older I'ma buy you a ring
You're such a sweet, sweet thing, you've got me shook up
There's women every single way I look
But you're the only one that's got me hooked
You got me hooked, oh darling Oh baby, I been thinking all about you lately
With the way you're looking who could blame me?
Oh baby, oh darling, of all the other girls I could be callin'
That phone of yours is ringing off the wall and
Oh oh darling, oh oh darling
You're such a sweet thing, sweet thing, sweet thing
Oh yeah!

I hope your soul is changing, changing
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees, praying I'm proud of who I am
No more monsters, I can breathe again
And you said that I was done
Well, you were wrong and now the best is yet to come
'Cause I can make it on my own
And I don't need you, I found a strength I've never known
I've been thrown out, I've been burned
When I'm finished, they won't even know your name You brought the flames and you put me through hell
I had to learn how to fight for myself
And we both know all the truth I could tell
I'll just say this is I wish you farewell I hope you're somewhere praying, praying
I hope your soul is changing, changing
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees, praying Oh, sometimes, I pray for you at night
Someday, maybe you'll see the light
Oh, some say, in life, you're gonna get what you give

I got a sick obsession
I'm seeing it in my dreams I'm looking down every alley
I'm makin' those desperate calls
I'm staying up all night hoping
Hittin' my head against the wall What you got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love Won't listen to any advice
Momma's telling me I should think twice
Better left to my own devices
I'm addicted, it's a crisis My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgment's getting kinda hazy
My steeze is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a lovesick crackhead What you got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave Hey, so I gotta question
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
Is my love with your drug? Your drug, your drug
Your drug, is my love your drug?
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
Hey, hey, so
Your love, your love, your love, your love is my drug You wanna lift me off my feet, parakeet
You got the crazy cream o' wheat, heatin' up my seat
And everytime you turn to leave, boy it's killin' me
That bonfire that you built in me is throwin' heat
I got a funny feelin' that your underneath my skin
The way your snappin' and tappin' it to my slim and jim
You think you know me forever, like we been next to kin
But we just met me in the bathtub in the basement You got that boom boom thing that makes my body bang
Got that boom boom thing (I got that fire)
Turn that boom box base right up and in my face
Gimme boom boom bang (I got that f-f-fire)
Boy your boom boom thing, just like a boomerang
Drives the girls insane (I got that fire)
Watch your boom boom base, were runnin' through my veins
Gimme boom boom bang (I got that f-f-fire) You try to tell that you're Biggie's second cousin's brother
But I don't care cause all I wanna makes' an album cover
The promise land that you be tryna land is undiscovered
You smell that fire, baby, that's cause we be burnin' rubbber
Up on the four-five, skiddin' on the one-oh-one
We sixty-ninen' on the sixty-six of Cossacun
Trees and autumn leaves, kneelin' right before the sun
And when the night and moon indeed another days begun Boom boom bang, boom b-boom bang, bang
Boom boom bang, boom
(I got that fire) You got that boom boom thing that makes my body bang
Got that boom boom thing (I got that fire)
Turn that boom box base right up and in my face

With my crazy beautiful life
With the parties, the disasters
With my friends all pretty and plastered
Every night we're down to go out
Wakin' up on a different couch
'Til the next night, on the next flight
Yeah, I guess we're doing alright Oh oh oh
We're fallin' in love
Oh oh oh
'Til the sun's comin' up
Oh oh oh
Just livin' the life
Oh oh oh Every single night we fight
To get a little high on life
To get a little something right
Something real
At least we try
Time after time
Try dodging all the douchebag guys
Try trading all the wasted times
For something real
In this crazy life I just hope some people see
There's nothing that I'm trying to be
Let me just stop all the shit talk
I know I'm the new bitch on the block
I've been through my sketchy phases
Been broke, been a shitty waitress
But I'm not now, guess it worked out
Got here my running my mouth Oh oh oh
We're fallin' in love

'Til the sun's comin' up
Oh oh oh

Something real
At least we try
Time after time
Try dodging all the douchebag guys
Try trading all the wasted times
For something real
In this crazy life Every single night we... Every single night we fight
To get a little high on life
To get a little something right
Something real
At least we try
Time after time
Try dodging all the douche bag guys
Try trading all the wasted times
For something real
In this crazy life Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh I miss your soft lips
I miss your white sheets
I miss the scratch of your unshaved face on my cheek
And this is so hard
'cause I didn't see
That you were the love of my life
And it kills me
I see your face in
Strangers on the street
I still say your name when I'm talking in my sleep
And in the limelight
I play it off fine
But I can't handle it when I turn off my night light
Oh Oh Oh Oh
But I can't handle it when I turn off my night light
Oh Oh Oh Oh They say that true love hurts
Well this could almost kill me
Young love murdered
That is what this must be
I would give it all to not be sleeping alone The life is fading from me
While you watch my heart bleed
Young love murdered
That is what this must be
I would give it all to not be sleeping alone Remember the time
We jumped the fence when
The Stones were playing and we were too broke to get in
You held my hand and
They made me cry while
I swore to God it was the best night of my life
Or when you took me
Across the world we
Promised that this would last forever but now I see
It was my past life
A beautiful time
Drunk off of nothing but each other 'til the sun rise Oh Oh Oh Oh
Drunk off of nothing but each other 'til the sun rise They say that true love hurts
Well this could almost kill me
Young love murdered
That is what this must be
I would give it all to not be sleeping alone The life is fading from me
While you watch my heart bleed
Young love murdered
That is what this must be
I would give it all to not be sleeping alone It was my past life
A beautiful time
Drunk off of nothing but each other 'til the sun rise

I was staring at the ceiling.
Baby, come turn on my night light
I've got a certain kind of feeling.
So I went over to my window,
All the world began to howl.
Got me growling at the full moon,
Come over here right now.
[Pre Chorus]
I am foaming at the mouth.
STARVING for a little bit of love.
Are you in or are you out?
You've got until I see the sun...
[Chorus]
Ahhh!
Baby hurry up.
Ahhh!
I'm STARVING for your love...
I'm STARVING for your love...
[Verse 2]
I thought last night I'd keep a low key,
I've been getting kinda twisted.
Yes, when you tried to call me,
I pretended I just missed it.
But then all the wine and whisky,
Started my imagination.
Now I need you to come and get me,
I've got a vicious proposition.
[Pre Chorus]
I am foaming at the mouth.
STARVING for a little bit of love.
Are you in or are you out?
You've got until I see the sun...
[Chorus]
Ahhh!
Baby hurry up.
Ahhh!
I'm STARVING for your love...
I'm STARVING for your love... There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around.
It's a hole in the wall.
It's a dirty free for all. When the dark
Of the night comes around.
That's the time
That the animal comes alive.
Looking for
Something wild. And now we lookin' like pimps
In my gold Trans-Am.
Got a water bottle full of whiskey
In my handbag.
Got my drunk text on
I'll regret it in the mornin'
But tonight

Everybody Take It Off. I used to live in the darkness
Dress in black, act so heartless
But now I see that colors are everything
Got kaleidoscopes in my hairdo
Got back the stars in my eyes, too
Yeah, now I see the magic inside of me Yeah, maybe my head's fucked up
But I'm falling right back in love with being alive
Dreaming in light, light, lights
This kitty cat lost her mind
Been looking for a star-sent sign that I'll be alright
Look to the skies I've found a rainbow, rainbow, baby
Trust me, I know, life is scary
But just put those colors on, girl
Come and play along with me tonight I'd forgot how to daydream
So consumed with the wrong things
But in the dark, I realized this life is short
And deep down, I'm still a child
Playful eyes, wide and wild
I can't lose hope, what's left of my heart's still made of gold And I know that I'm still fucked up
But aren't we all, my love?
Darling, our scars make us who we are, are
So when the winds are howling strong
And you think you can't go on, hold tight, sweetheart You'll find a rainbow, rainbow, baby
Trust me, I know life is scary
But just put those colors on, girl
Come and play along with me tonight
You gotta learn to let go, put the past behind you
Trust me, I know, the ghosts will try to find you
But just put those colors on, girl
Come and paint the world with me tonight
Night, night, night, night, night I found a rainbow, rainbow, baby
Trust me, I know life is scary
But just put those colors on, girl
You gotta learn to let go, put the past behind you
Trust me, I know, the ghosts will try to find you
But just put those colors on, girl
Come and paint the world with me tonight
Oh, put those colors on, girl
Come and paint the world with me tonight

Should we go again? It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter, anyhow
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm traveling on
Don't think twice, it's all right.
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
That light I never knowed
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
But I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talking anyway
So don't think twice, it's all right.
It ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
Like you never done before
It ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
I can't hear you any more
I'm a-thinking and a-wond'rin' walking down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
Don't think twice, it's all right.
So long honey, babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
Goodbye's too good a word, babe
So I'll just say fare thee well
I ain't saying you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right. I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young We're gonna die young

We're gonna die young Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young Downtown tonight,
I saw an old friend, someone who
I used to take comfort from
Long before I met you.
I caught a spark from his eyes
A forgotten desire.
With the word or a touch
I could have rekindled that fire. Old flames, can't hold a candle to you.
No one can light up the night like you do.
Flickering embers of love
I've known one or two,
But old flames can't hold a candle to you. Sometimes at night
I think of the lovers I've known.
Remembering them holding me 
Helps me not feel so alone.
Then I feel you beside me
And even their memories are gone.
Like stars in the night
Lost in the sweet light of dawn. And old flames, can't hold a candle to you.
No one can light up the night like you do.
Flickering embers of love
I've known one or two,
But Old flames can't hold a candle to you.
Old flames can't hold a candle to you.
hmmmm mmm mmm mmm
 Here we go
Welcome to my funeral
Without you, I don't even have a pulse
All alone it's dark and cold
With every move I die Here I go
This is my confessional
A lost cause, nobody can save my soul
I am so delusional
With every move I die I have destroyed our love,
It's gone
Payback is sick
It's all my fault I'm dancing with tears in my eyes
Just fighting to get through the night
I'm losing it
With every move I die I'm fading
I'm broken inside
I've wasted the love of my life
I'm losing it
With every move I die When did I become such a hyprocrite
Double life, lies that you caught me in
Trust me I'm paying for it
With every move I die On the floor I'm just a zombie
Who I am is not who I wanna be
I'm such a tragedy
With every move I die I have destroyed our life,
It's gone
Payback is sick
It's all my fault I'm dancing with tears in my eyes
Just fighting to get through the night
I'm losing it
With every move I die I'm fading
I'm broken inside
I've wasted the love of my life
I'm losing it
With every move I die Oooh
This is it and now you're really gone this time
Never once thought I'd be in pieces left behind I'm dancing with tears in my eyes
Just fighting to get through the night
I'm losing it
With every move I die I'm fading
I'm broken inside
I've wasted the love of my life
I'm losing it
With every move I die I think about you all the time
One look, my knees get weak
Practically die
So hard to sleep
When i'm so close to this dream coming true
True, True
How do I tell, tell you?
When.... Chorus:
I can't speak
I'm terrified
Cause if I
Say the wrong thing
You might see how hard i'm trying
Is this made up
Or true love
Is this true love
Is this true love Walk by and i'm a nervous wreck
The way you smell
The way you dress, is so perfect
My tonuge is tied cause
I can't translate these feelings inside ide ide
Oh Chorus:
I can't speak
I'm terrified
Cause if I
Say the wrong thing
You might see how hard i'm trying
Is this made up?
Or true love
Is this true love
Is this true love I want to tell you my secrets
I'll tell you everything
My heart is racing
I'm waiting for some sign from you
How do I say it to my True Love (True Love)
Tell me you feel it to my true love (True Love) Chorus:
I can't speak
I'm terrified
Cause if I
Say the wrong thing
You might see how hard i'm trying
Is this made up?
Or true love
Is this true love
Is this true love I am in love,
With what we are,
Not what we should be.
And I am,
I am starstruck.
With every part,
Of this whole story.
So if it's just tonight,
The animal inside,
Let it live and die.
Like it's the end of time,
Like everything inside,
Let it live and die.
This is our last chance,
Give me your hands.
'Cause our world is spinning at the speed of light.
The night is fading, heart is racing.
Now just come and love me like we're gonna die.
Oh.
I'm not asleep, I'm up for the fight
Into the magic.
And I don't, want the concrete.
I am alive.
Comes with the tragic.
So if it's just tonight,
The animal inside,
Let it live and die.
This is our last chance, Give me your hands.
'Cause our world is spinning at the speed of light.
The night is fading, heart is racing.
Now just come and love me like we're gonna die.
Oh.
Oh.
Da da da da da da.
Oh.
This is our last chance, Give me your hands.

But the exit signs always on my mind, always in my sight.
I can say that I really want to stay,
But the devil inside always wins the fight, always gets his way. Jump out the window gotta get out on the highway,
Think things have getting too attached I need an escape.
I'm seeing stars and there is nothing more that I hate, baby. There is something that I gotta say.
It's disgusting, how I love you.
God, I hate me. I could kill you.
Cause your messing up my name.
Gotta walk my talk my fame, but I just want to touch your face.
It's disgusting.
It's disgusting, how you changed me.
From a bandit to a baby.
Thinking about gotta change my name,
If I'm gonna walk this walk of shame.
Look at what you do to me.
It's disgusting. My mind blinks like a traffic light.
It's green and red and stop and go. Changing all the time.
And it makes me scared, that I haven't loved.
That it's still right here, more or or or less. Stuck out in traffic, ya, I gotta go my own way.
My head is slipping, too intense I need an escape
I'm seeing stars and there is nothing more than I hate, baby. There is something that I gotta say.
It's disgusting, how I love you.
God, I hate me. I could kill you.
Cause your messing up my name.
Gotta walk my talk my fame, but I just want to touch your face.
It's disgusting.
It's disgusting, how you changed me.
From a bandit to a baby.
Thinking about gotta change my name,
If I'm gonna walk this walk of shame.
Look at what you do to me.
It's disgusting. Chapter by chapter, I'm falling faster and faster,
Becoming manic and magic it's so romantic I panic, oh.
Hit the eject button but it must be stuck, somethings up.
What did you slip into my drink? Baby. It's disgusting, how I love you.
God, I hate me. I could kill you.
Cause your messing up my name.
Gotta walk my talk my fame, but I just want to touch your face.
It's disgusting.

And everybody knows it (and everybody knows it)
Talk Talk Talk

Taking and twisting and turning so manipulating
oh girl

you're looking like a lunatic
And everybody knows it (and everybody knows it)
everybody knows (Back Back Backstabber)
yeah you're looking like a lunatic
And everybody knows (Back Back Backstabber)
yeah everybody knows
Back Back Backstabber So far away, from the place where I feel safe
I can't recall, the beauty in your face
The distance between us sows its dirty seeds
Spreading inside of me with every breath I breathe While you were sleeping, I was wondering - would the lonely be back?
While you were sleeping, trying to fill the void you've left
Life is short and the nights are long, and tonight
I moved on, while you were sleeping A stranger for the night, so I don't wake up alone (all alone)
To fake what we had, but it doesn't feel like home.
The distance between us, grows its dirty seeds
consuming my insides, with every breath I breathe While you were sleeping, I was wondering - would the lonely be back?
While you were sleeping, trying to fill the void you've left
life is short and the nights are long, and tonight
I moved on, while you were sleeping. Don't look for me, don't wait for me, I've found my path
(While you were sleeping)
Over sticks and stones, over broken bones.
I won't look back
(While you were sleeping)
There's a place for you somewhere in my heart, but that's the past. While you were sleeping I was wondering - would the lonely be back?
While you were sleeping, trying to fill the void you've left
Life is short and the nights are long, and tonight I moved on
While you were sleeping Couldn't help it when we met,
I was playing hard to get.
But one look and that was it.
Now it doesn't matter.
Drinking wine on the cement,
Outside 7-11.
Fell in love on accident,
Now it doesn't matter. You got to me,
You saw through me,
You're in for it now. You're all I wanna do.
I only wanna dance with you.
Whatever I got to do.
I want you to myself tonight,
All right.
I only wanna dance with you. Used to being on the road,
Crazy nights and playing shows.
Used to dancing all alone,
Now it doesn't matter.
Since you got a hold of me,
I'm talking about you in my sleep.
What the hell did you do to me?
Oh, it doesn't matter. I fell for you, yeah
Boy you're so screwed, so
You're in for it now. You're all I wanna do.

Was telling everyone it's not that bad
'Til all my shit hi-hit the fan I know I'm always like
Telling everybody you don't gotta be a victim
Life ain't always fair, but Hell is living in resentment
Choose redemption, your happy ending's up to you I think it's time to practice what I preach
Exorcise the demons inside me
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go The past can't haunt me if I don't let it
Live and learn, and never forget it
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go Had a boogieman under my bed
Putting crazy thoughts inside my head
Always whispering, "It's all your fault"
He was telling me, "No, you're not that strong" I know I'm always like
Telling everybody you don't have to be a victim
Life ain't always fair, but Hell is living in resentment
Choose redemption, your happy ending's up to you So I think it's time to practice what I preach
Exorcise the demons inside me
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go The past can't haunt me if I don't let it

Hey, hey, hey. [Verse 1: Kesha]
Stars fall at my feet, keep me grounded as I reach
Higher than I see, is there something there for me?
Pulling back the reins, letting go again
I'm not afraid, I'm not [Chorus: Kesha]
All my life, one page at a time
I'll show you my, my true colors
And no-n-no, I won't apologize for the fire in my eyes
Let me show you my, my true colors, it ain't no rainbow [Verse 2: Kesha]
A promise with a lie is broken by design
And what I thought I knew has been swallowed by the truth
It's time to light the flame, right before it rains
I'm not afraid, I'm not [Chorus: Kesha]
All my life, one page at a time
I'll show you my, my true colors
And no-n-no, I won't apologize for the fire in my eyes
Let me show you my, my true colors, it ain't no rainbow [Bridge: Kesha]
Something tells me I know nothing at all
I've escaped my capture and I have no master
And somehow it's like I've waited [Chorus: Kesha]
All my life, one page at a time
I'll show you my, my true colors
And no-n-no, I won't apologize for the fire in my eyes
Let me show you my, my true colors, it ain't no rainbow
It ain't no rainbow, it ain't no rainbow
It ain't no rainbow Baby, when we're touching in the dark
Can you feel it? I can hear the pounding of my heart
Can you feel it? When you take my body to the stars
I believe it Boy, this love is supernatural
Can you feel it? Come, take me by the hand
Wanna cross the line, baby, go ahead
'Till the morning light, watch my silhouette
'Cause you know tonight we're gonna wake the dead
Get a little bit wrong, get a little bit wild
Get a little bit high off of this love tonight
Get a little bit raw, come a little undone
Get a little bit reckless, I can't get enough Baby, when we're touching in the dark
Can you feel it?
I can hear the pounding of my heart
Can you feel it?
When you take my body to the stars
I believe it Boy, this love is supernatural
Can you feel it? Come, take me in the night
I feel it in my blood, want the darker side Baby, when we touch, look me in the eyes
Poison me with love, I'll bring you back to life Get a little bit wrong, get a little bit wild
Get a little bit high off of this love tonight Get a little bit raw, come a little undone
Get a little bit reckless, I can't get enough
Baby, when we're touching in the dark
Can you feel it?
I can hear the pounding of my heart
Can you feel it?
When you take my body to the stars
I believe it Boy, this love is supernatural
Can you feel it?
Baby, when we're touching in the dark
I can hear the pounding of my heart
Baby, when we're touching in the dark

Tr-tr-trouble in the dark. Feelin' like a sabre-tooth tiger
Sipper on a warm Budweiser
Touch me and give me that rush
Better pack a toothbrush
Gonna pull an all-nighter. We been keepin' it couture
But I wanna get it on vulture
Come, give me some of that yum
Like a lollipop, baby
Don't be scared. C'mon, 'cause I know what I like
And you're looking just like my type
Let's go for it just for tonight
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
Now don't even try to deny
We're both goin' home satisfied
Let's go for it just for tonight
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. (I don't wanna), go to sleep
I wanna stay up all night
I wanna just screw around.
(I don't wanna), think about
What's gonna be after this
I wanna just live right now.
(I don't wanna), go to sleep
I wanna stay up all night
I wanna just screw around.
(I don't wanna), think about
What's gonna be after this
I wanna just live right now.
(So come on)!
C'mon, 'cause I know what I like
And you're looking just like my type
Let's go for it just for tonight
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
Now don't even try to deny
We're both goin' home satisfied
Let's go for it just for tonight

(D.U.I.) I have boys in every country code
Just a rollin' stoner on a roll
I'd bring the cowgirl out and cock them guns
Always leave before the cowboy comes Then I met you Saturday night, I tried to run away
Sunday morning, I woke up fucked up, with you right next to me
Had a flight booked to Japan, but you took me by the hand
Now every morning I wake up with you right next to me I'm walking on air, kickin' my blues
Everything stops when I'm with you
So slide over here, tell me the truth
I know you love me wearing nothing but your boots Ah oh, ah oh, ah oh, oh
Ah oh, ah oh, ah oh, oh Never thought about that wifey life
Wedding bells just made me wanna die
But when you grab me and you spin me 'round
You really screw my head up upside-down Then I met you Saturday night, I tried to run away
Sunday morning, I woke up fucked up, with you right next to me
Had a flight booked to Japan, but you took me by the hand
Now every morning I wake up with you right next to me I'm walking on air, kickin' my blues
Everything stops when I'm with you
So slide over here, tell me the truth
I know you love me wearing nothing but your boots Ah oh, ah oh, ah oh, oh
Ah oh, ah oh, ah oh, oh If you can't handle these claws, you don't get this kitty
Baby, pick me up, spin me 'round, take me on a ride
Pull you by the belt, recognize that you're mine tonight
Baby, pick me up, spin me 'round, take me on a ride
Pull you by the belt, recognize that you're mine tonight I'm walking on air, kickin' my blues
Everything stops, ah, when I'm wearing
When I'm wearing, baby, nothing but your boots Ah oh, ah oh, ah oh, oh
Nothing but your boots
Ah oh, ah oh, ah oh, oh
Nothing but your boots, ah ooh

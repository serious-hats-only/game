It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live If I was a sculptor but then again no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
Oh I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you And you can tell everybody this is your song It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on So excuse me forgetting but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world Take my hand, stay, Joanne
Heaven's not ready for you
Every part of my aching heart
Needs you more than the angels do Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?
Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl? If you could, I know that you'd stay
We both know things don't work that way
I promised I wouldn't say goodbye
So I grin, and my voice gets thin Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?
Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl? Honestly, I know where you're goin'
And, baby, you're just moving on
And I'll still love you even if I can't see you anymore
Can't wait to see you soar Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?
Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl? Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh, oh-oh-oh

You've left me speechless, so speechless And I'll never love again
Oh, boy, you've left me speechless

He's gonna get you, and after he's through
There's gonna be no love left to rye And I know that it's complicated

Would you give it all up?
Could you give it all up?
If I promise, boy, to you That I'll never talk again
And I'll never love again
I'll never write a song
Won't even sing along
I'll never love again How?

Ale-ale-jandro (2) (Last night) Our lovers' quarrel
(I was thinking about you)
Hurts more than I can say
(And it was kinda dirty)
All night (and the way that you looked at me)
Help me here (it was kinda nasty, ah)
Help me here (it was kinda trashy)
'Cause I can't help my mind from going there Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Doing really nasty things (you were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Making love in my sex dreams We could (I) be caught (just want this to be perfect)
We're both convicted criminals of thought
('Cause I'm broken)
Let's white (by the one before) glove the bed
(He was kinda nasty, ah)
Help me here (and I feel so trashy)
'Cause we can't hide the evidence in our heads Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Doing really nasty things (you were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Making love in my sex dreams (Don't stop the party)
Making love in my sex dreams
(Let's keep it naughty, yeah)
Making love in my sex dreams
(Watch me act a fool)
Making love in my sex dreams
Tomorrow when I run into you
Tomorrow when I run into you You could turn to stone or the color of
Men petrified by a woman
In love, as I am when I lay with you
I think of him, I think of him I can't believe I'm telling you this
But I've had a couple of drinks and
Oh my god Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Doing really nasty things (you were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (you were in my) Last night (don't stop the party)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams
(Let's keep it naughty, yeah)
Doing really nasty things
(Watch me act a fool)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams
(Tomorrow when I run into you)
Making love in my sex dreams Trying to get control
Pressure's taking its toll
Stuck in the middle zone
I just want you alone My guessing game is strong
Way too real to be wrong
Caught up in your show
Yeah, at least now I know It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
Oh, you were a perfect illusion I don't need eyes to see
I felt you touching me
High like amphetamine
Maybe you're just a dream That's what it means to crush
Now that I'm waking up
I still feel the blow
But at least now I know It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion) (Where are you? 'Cause I can't see you)
It was a perfect illusion (but I feel you watching me)
(Dilated, falling free in a modern ecstasy) (Where are you? 'Cause I can't see you)
It was a perfect illusion (but I feel you watching me)
(But I feel you watching me)
Illusion (but I feel you watching me) Mistaken for love
(Where are you? 'Cause I can't see you)
(But I feel you watching me)
Mistaken for love (dilated, falling free)
(In a modern ecstasy)
Mistaken for love (in a modern ecstasy)
(In a modern ecstasy) I'm over the show
Yeah, at least now I know It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion) Oh, you were a perfect illusion
Oh, it was a perfect illusion It was a perfect illusion
Somewhere in all the confusion
It was a perfect illusion, illusion, illusion It was a perfect illusion
Somewhere in all the confusion
You were so perfect

And I want you to know I am my hair I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair I've had enough, I'm not a freak
I just keep fighting to stay cool on these streets
I've had enough, enough, enough
And this is my prayer, I swear I'm as free as my hair
I'm as free as my hair
I am my hair
I am my hair
Free as my hair
Free as my hair Sometimes I want some raccoon or red highlights
Just because I want my friends to think I'm dynamite
And on Friday, Rock City High School dance
I've got my bangs to hide that I don't stand a chance
A chance I just wanna be myself
And I want you to love me for who I am
I just wanna be myself
And I want you to know I am my hair I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair I've had enough, I'm not a freak
I just keep fighting to stay cool on these streets
I've had enough, enough, enough
And this is my prayer, I swear I'm as free as my hair
I'm as free as my hair
I am my hair
I am my hair
Free as my hair
Free as my hair I just wanna be free, I just wanna be me
And I want lots of friends that invite me to their parties
Don't wanna change, and I don't wanna be ashamed
I'm the spirit of my hair, it's all the glory that I bear I'm my hair, I am my hair
I'm my hair, I am my hair
I am my hair, I am my hair
I am my hair (all the glory that I bear) I'm my hair, I am my hair
It's all the glory that I bear
I'm my hair, I am my hair I'm my hair, yeah (all the glory that I bear)
I'm my hair, yeah (all the glory that I bear)
I'm my hair, yeah (all the glory that I bear)
My hair, yeah I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair I've had enough, I'm not a freak
I just keep fighting to stay cool on these streets
I've had enough, enough, enough
And this is my prayer, I swear I'm as free as my hair
I'm as free as my hair (this is my prayer)
I am my hair
I am my hair
Ooh, I'm my hair, I'm my hair It's like, I just love a cowboy, you know
I'm just like, I just, I know it's bad, but I'm just like
Can I just like, hang off the back of your horse
And can you go a little faster?! 3 am, mustang speeding
Two lovers headed for a dead end
Too fast, hold tight, he laughs
Running through the red lights Hollering over, rubber spinning
Big swig, toss another beer can
Too lit, tonight, praying
On the moonlight Every John is just the same
I'm sick of their city games
I crave a real wild man
I'm strung out on John Wayne (Dat - doo - deet - doe)
(Dat - doo - deet - doe, dat - doo - deet - doe)
Baby, let's get high, John Wayne
(Dat - doo - deet - doe)
(Dat - doo - deet - doe, dat - doo - deet - doe)
Baby, let's get high, John Wayne Blue collar and a red-state treasure
Love junkie on a three-day bender
His grip, so hard, eyes glare
Trouble like a mug shot Charged up 'cause the man's on a mission
1-2 ya, the gears are shifting
He called, I cried, we broke
Racing through the moonlight Every John is just the same
I'm sick of their city games
I crave a real wild man
I'm strung out on John Wayne (Dat - doo - deet - doe)
(Dat - doo - deet - doe, dat - doo - deet - doe)
Baby, let's get high, John Wayne
(Dat - doo - deet - doe)
(Dat - doo - deet - doe, dat - doo - deet - doe)
Baby, let's get high, John Wayne So here I go to the eye of the storm
Just to feel your love
Knock me over
Here I go into our love storm (Dat - doo - deet - doe)

Silicon, saline, poison, inject me
Baby, I'm a free bitch
I'm a free bitch Some girls won't dance to the beat of the track
She won't walk away, but she won't look back
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she's a mess She's a mess, she's a mess
Now the girl is stressed
She's a mess, she's a mess
She's a mess, she's a mess
(Tell 'em, girls) Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's looking, she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's looking, she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves to dance in the dark
(Saline) Run, run, her kiss is a vampire grin
The moon lights her way while she's howling at him
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she's a tramp She's a tramp, she's a vamp
But she still does her dance
She's a tramp, she's a vamp
But she still kills the dance
(Tell 'em, girls) Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's looking, she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's looking, she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves to dance in the dark In the dark
She loves to dance in the dark
In the dark
She loves, she loves to dance in the dark Marilyn, Judy, Sylvia
Tell 'em how you feel, girls Work your blonde Benét Ramsey
We'll haunt like Liberace
Find your freedom in the music
Find your Jesus, find your Kubrick You will never fall apart
Diana, you're still in our hearts
Never let you fall apart
Together we'll dance in the dark Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's looking, she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark
Baby, yeah Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's looking, she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves to dance in the dark
In the dark It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live If I was a sculptor but then again no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
Oh I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you And you can tell everybody this is your song It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on So excuse me forgetting but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world Sometimes a story has no end
Sometimes I think that we could just be friends
"'Cause I'm a wandering man," he said to me
"And what about our future plans?
Does this thing we have even make sense
When I got the whole world in front of me?"
So I said I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we could see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight!
Tonight! So I just packed my baggage, and
Said goodbye to family and friends
And took a road to nowhere on my own
Like Dorothy on a yellow brick
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick
'Cause I left everyone I love at home And I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we could see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight!
Tonight! 'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm And then he asked me, he said:
"Baby, why do we love each other?"
I said: "Honey, it's simple
It's the way that you love and treat your mother" Thought that I would be alone forever
But I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home, but I think
With you, I could spend my life
And you'll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags, and we can chase the sunset
Bust the rear view, and fire up the jets
'Cause it's you and me Baby, for life!
(If you go with me)
For life!
(See the world with me) 'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
Russia, UK, Paris, I'm Italian, Asian kompai
Africa, India, I'm gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm

I feel down, I wish you were mine
I close my eyes, take a breath and I picture us
In a place I can't recognize In the fire I call your name out
Up all night trying to rub the pain out I'm singing

I promise this drink is my last one
I know I fucked up again
'Cause I lost my only friend
God, forgive my sins
Don't leave me, I
Oh, I'd hate myself until I die My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low from living high for so long
I'm sorry, and I love you
Stay with me, Bell Bottom Blue
I'll keep on searching for an answer
'Cause I need you more than dope I need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
I need you more than dope
I need you more than dope Toast one last puff
And two last regrets
Three spirits and twelve lonely steps
Up heaven's stairway to gold
Mine myself like coal
A mountain of his soul
Each day I cry
Oh, I feel so low from living high My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low from living high for so long
I'm sorry, and I love you
Stay with me, Bell Bottom Blue
I'll keep on searching for an answer
'Cause I need you more than dope I need you more than dope
I need you more than dope
I need you more than dope
I need you more than dope I need you more
Need you more
I need you more than dope When they're young, all Little Monsters learn that they are scary.
Ugly, stupid, shunned by Cupid, overweight, and hairy.
But every Monster needs to find that secret deep inside
that transfers Dr. Jekyl into sexy Mr. Hyde.
All my Monsters are beautiful, discostoodiful, squarerootiful, oldcootiful.
Monsters don't need implants or a bitchin' Monster car,
Monsters only need to love the Monsters that they are.
Oh yeah! Gaga, dada, jawa, PEACE, ew You've gotta a lotta lotta nerve
Coming here when I'm still with him
And I can't have you, it isn't fair
Born March of '86, my birthday's coming
And if I had one wish
Yeah, you'd be it When you're 'round
I lose myself inside your mouth
You've got brown eyes
Like no one else
Baby make it to me Again and again
Again, again, again, again
Never stop again and again
Again, again, a-a-again, again
Never stop, oh He never really saw me
Or waited when we were hooking up
Yeah he'd a never last
Last week when I was sad
You said that you knew
My eyes change from kinda green
To kind blue, heya When you're 'round
I lose myself inside your mouth
You've got brown eyes
Like no one else
Baby make it to me Again and again
Again, again, again, again
Never stop again and again
Again, again, a-a-again, again
Never stop They tell me if I leave him
Baby would you be there
'Cause maybe you could
Be m-m-mine all the t-t-time Come to me
In all your glamour and cruelty
Just do that thing that you do
And I'll undress you Keep it tight
Sometimes the simplest move is right
The melody that you choose
Can rescue you A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My ARTPOP could mean anything We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
ARTPOP, ARTPOP Come to me
With all your subtext and fantasy
Just do that thing that you do
In a perverse hue Lovers' kites
Are flown on beaches for public sight
The color palette you choose
Can profit you A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My ARTPOP could mean anything Could try to sell you out, or I
Could show you all the reasons why
My ARTPOP could mean anything We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
ARTPOP, ARTPOP Brushes with darkness won't help you create
Your destiny of self
But ARTPOP could mean anything
Anything I try to sell myself, but I am really laughing
Because I just love the music, not the bling
Music, not the bling We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
ARTPOP, ARTPOP We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
ARTPOP, ARTPOP Free my mind, ARTPOP

I love you, when it's hard today
I'll lay back in my chair and find a way
And when you say that thing that you say
That makes me mad, I'll turn away
I'll turn away, I'll turn away And think of different ways to keep my spirits up
And choreograph hours with playful joyish thoughts We both know I could learn a thing or two
About relaxing, hey, I love you
And after all, it's just another day Oh, I could use some two or three
Or other kind of ways to be
But today I won't be so hard on me
I'll walk alone down a different street
And smile at all the new strange I meet And pick up unique style
I'll kick around today
And create simple thoughts
I'll laugh in humble ways We both know I could learn a thing or two
About behaving, but I love you
And after all, it's just another day Come on, Mark!
Ladies and gentlemen, Brian Newman We both know I could learn a thing or two

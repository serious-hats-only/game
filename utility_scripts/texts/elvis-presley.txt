Please don't break my heart in two
That's not hard to do
'Cause I don't have a wooden heart
And if you say goodbye
Then I know that I would cry
Maybe I would die
'Cause I don't have a wooden heart
There's no strings upon this love of mine
It was always you from the start
Treat me nice, treat me good
Treat me like you really should
'Cause I'm not made of wood
And I don't have a wooden heart
Muss I denn, muss I denn
Zum stadt heraus Stadt heraus
Und du, mein schatz, bleibst hier?
Muss I denn, muss I denn Zum stadt heraus Stadt heraus

There's no strings upon this love of mine
It was always you from the start
Sei mir gut, sei mir gut
Sei mir wie du wirklich sollst
Wie du wirklich sollst
'Cause I don't have a wooden heart When no one else can understand me,
when everything I do is wrong,
you give me hope and consolation,
you give me strength to carry on
And you're always there
to lend a hand
in everything I do That's the wonder,
the wonder of you
And when you smile the world is brighter,
you touch my hand and I'm a king,
your kiss to me is worth a fortune, your love for me is everything I guess I'll never know
the reason why
you love me as you do
That's the wonder,
the wonder of you
I guess I'll never know
the reason why
you love me as you do
That's the wonder,
the wonder of you When I think of how he came so far from glory
Came to dwell among the lowly such as i
To suffer shame and such disgrace
On mount calvary take my place
Then I ask myself this question
Who am i? Who am I that the king would bleed and die for?
Who am I that he would pray not my will, thine lord?
The answer I may never know
Why he ever loved me so
That to an old rugged cross he'd go
For who am i? When I'm reminded of his words
I'll leave you never
If you'll be true I'll give to you life forever
Oh I wonder what I could have done
To deserve god's only son
To fight my battles until they're won
For who am i? Who am I that the king would bleed and die for
Who am I that he would pray not my will, thine lord
The answer I may never know
Why he ever loved me so
That to an old rugged cross he'd go
For who am i?
That to an old rugged cross he'd go, for who am i? Train I ride, sixteen coaches long
Train I ride, sixteen coaches long
Well, that long black train got my baby and gone Train train, comin' 'round, 'round the bend
Train train, comin' 'round the bend
Well, it took my baby, but it never will again (no, not again) Train train, comin' down, down the line
Train train, comin' down the line
Well, it's bringin' my baby, 'cause she's mine all, all mine
(She's mine, all, all mine) Train train, comin' 'round, 'round the bend ('round, 'round the bend)
Train train, comin' 'round the bend ('round the bend)
Well, it took my baby, but it never will again (no, never will again) This thing called love, I just can't handle it
This thing called love, I must get 'round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love This thing called love
It cries in a cradle all night
It swings, it jives
It shakes all over like a jellyfish
I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love There goes my baby
She knows how to rock and roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool, cool sweat I gotta be cool, relax
Get hip, get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motor bike
Until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love I gotta be cool relax
Get hip and get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motor bike
Until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love This thing called love, I just can't handle it
This thing called love, I must get 'round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love... The warden threw a party in the county jail

If you ever go

I would beg and steal
(Beg and steal) Just to feel
(Just to feel)

(I want your heart) Beatin' close to mine
(So close to mine)

Well, if you ever go
Darling, I'll be oh so lonely
Beggin' on my knees
All I ask is please, please love me
Oh yeah Well, since my baby left me,
I found a new place to dwell.
It's down at the end of lonely street
at Heartbreak Hotel. Heartbreak is so lonely baby,
Heartbreak is so lonely,
Heartbreak is so lonely I could die. And although it's always crowded,
you still can find some room.
Where broken hearted lovers
do cry away their gloom. Heartbreak is so lonely baby,
Heartbreak is so lonely,
Heartbreak is so lonely I could die. Well, the Bell hop's tears keep flowin',
and the desk clerk's dressed in black.
Well they been so long on lonely street
They ain't ever gonna look back. Heartbreak is so lonely baby,
Heartbreak is so lonely,
Heartbreak is so lonely I could die. Hey now, if your baby leaves you,
and you got a tale to tell.
Just take a walk down lonely street
to Heartbreak Hotel. You'll be so lonely, baby
You'll be so lonely
You'll be so lonely you could die Although its always crowded
You still can find some room
For broken hearted lovers
to cry away the blues Heartbreak is so lonely, baby
It is so lonely
They'll be so lonely, they could die I believe for every drop of rain that falls
A flower grows
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night
A candle glows
I believe for everyone who goes astray, someone will come
To show the way
I believe, I believe I believe above a storm the smallest prayer
Can still be heard
I believe that someone in the great somewhere
Hears every word Everytime I hear a new born baby cry,
Or touch a leaf or see the sky
Then I know why, I believe Everytime I hear a new born baby cry,
Or touch a leaf or see the sky
Then I know why, I believe As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries
'cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto People, don't you understand
The child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
In the ghetto Then one night in desperation
The young man breaks away
He buys a gun, steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto
As her young man dies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries Are you lonesome tonight,
Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray to a brighter sunny day When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight? I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world's a stage
And each must play a part.
Fate had me playing in love you as my sweet heart. Act one was when we met, I loved you at first glance
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two, you seemed to change and you acted strange
And why I'll never know.
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you.
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than go on living without you.
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then make them bring the curtain down. Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight? There must be lights burning brighter somewhere
Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue
If I can dream of a better land
Where all my brothers walk hand in hand
Tell me why, oh why, oh why
Can't my dream come true oh why? There must be peace and understanding sometime
Strong winds of promise that will blow away
The doubt and fear, if I can dream of a warmer sun
Where hope keeps shining on everyone
Tell me why, oh why, oh why Won't that sun appear?
We're lost in a cloud, with too much of rain
We're trapped in a world, that's troubled with pain
But as long as a man, has the strength to dream He can redeem his soul and fly
(Deep in heart)
Deep in my heart there's a tremblin' question
Still I am sure that the answer, answer's gonna come somehow
Out there in the dark, there's a beckoning candle
And while I can think, while I can talk
While I can stand, while I can walk
While I can dream, please let my dream
Come true right now, let it come true right now oh yeah Wise men say only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay? Would it be a sin?
If I can't help falling in love with you Like a river flows shorely to the sea
Darling so it goes some things are meant to be
Take my hand, take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you Like a river flows shorely to the sea
Darling so it goes some things are meant to be
Take my hand take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you For I can't help falling in love with you Shackled by the heavy burden
'neath a load of guilt and shame.
Then the hand of Jesus touched me
He touched me
and now I am no longer the same.
For He touched me
oh, He touched me
He touched me
and now all the wonderful joy that floods my soul.
Something happened and now I know
He touched me and made me whole.
Oh since I met this Blessed Savior
and since He cleansed and made me whole,
oh I'm with the saints
with the saints to praise Him,
and shout it while eternity rolls.
Oh, He touched me,
oh, He touched me.
He touched me.
And all the joy that floods my soul.
Something happened and now I know
He touched me and made me whole. Lord Almighty,

Higher higher
It's burnin' through to my soul

But I feel fine 'Cause your kisses lift me higher
Like a sweet song of a fire
And you light my mornin' sky
With burnin' love (With burnin' love)
It's comin' closer
The flames are now lickin' my body
Won't you help me
I feel like I'm slippin' away
It's hard to breath
My chest is a-heavin'
Lord, have mercy
I'm burnin' a hole where I lay, yeah Your kisses lift me higher
Like the sweet song of a fire
You light my morning sky
With burnin' love

But I must go alone
Till the lord comes and calls, calls me away, oh yes
Well the morning's so bright
And the lamp is alight
And the night, night is as black as the sea, oh yes There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow
No trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me, for me Well the bear will be gentle
And the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh yes
And the beasts from the wild
Shall be lit by a child

There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow
No trouble, trouble I see

Sitting home all alone
If you can't come around
At least please telephone.

I' gonna tell you a little story,
so you'll understand where I'm talking about
Down there we have a plant that
grows out in the woods and the fields,
and it looks something like a turnip green.
Everybody calls it Polk salad. Now that's Polk salad.
Used to know a girl that lived down there and
she'd go out in the evenings to pick a mess of it...
Carry it home and cook it for supper,
'cause that's about all they had to eat,
But they did all right. Down in Louisiana
Where the alligators grow so mean
Lived a girl that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame Polk salad Annie
'Gators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
For the mama was working on the chain-gang
What a mean, vicious woman Everyday before suppertime
She'd go down by the truck patch
And pick her a mess of Polk salad
And carry it home in a tote sack Polk salad Annie
'Gators got you granny
Everybody said it was a shame
'Cause the mama was working on the chain-gang
Whoo, how wretched, dispiteful,
straight-razor totin' woman,
Lord have mercy. Sock a little Polk salad to him
Yeah, you know what, yeah, yeah But daddy was a lazy and a no-count
Claimed he had a bad back
All her brothers were fit for
Was stealing watermelons out of my truck patch For once Polk salad Annie
'Gators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
For the mama was working on the chain-gang Sock a little Polk salad to him
You know what meets a meal mention
You sock a little
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah Chic a bon, chic a bon,
chic a bon bon bon bon
Chic a bon, chic a bon,

Sock a little Polk salad to him
You know what meets a meal mention
Sock a little Polk salad to him

Chinc, chinc, chinc,
chin, ling, ling ling O Lord my God! when I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made,
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy power throughout the universe displayed: Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee:
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
Then sings my soul! my Savior God, to Thee:
How great Thou art, how great Thou art! When through the woods and forest glades I wander
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze: Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee:
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
Then sings my soul! my Savior God, to Thee:
How great Thou art, how great Thou art! And when I think that God, His Son not sparing,
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sin: Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee:
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
Then sings my soul! my Savior God, to Thee:
How great Thou art, how great Thou art! When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!
Then I shall bow in humble adoration,
And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art! Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee:
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
Then sings my soul! my Savior God, to Thee:
How great Thou art, how great Thou art! It's now or never
come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling
be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
it's now or never
My love won't wait. When I first saw you
with your smile so tender
My heart was captured
my soul surrendered
I'd spend a lifetime
waiting for the right time
Now that your near
the time is here at last. It's now or never
come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling
be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
it's now or never
My love won't wait. Just like a willow
we would cry an ocean
If we lost true love
and sweet devotion
Your lips excite me
let your arms invite me
For who knows when
we'll meet again this way It's now or never
come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling
be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
it's now or never
My love won't wait
it's now or never
My love won't wait. Memories, pressed between the pages of my mind
Memories, sweetened through the ages just like wine Quiet thoughts come floating down and settle softly to the ground
Like golden autumn leaves around my feet
I touched them and they burst apart with sweet memories
Sweet memories Of holding hands and red bouquets
And twilights trimmed in purple haze
And laughing eyes and simple ways
And quiet nights and gentle days with you Memories, pressed between the pages of my mind
Memories, sweetened through the ages just like wine
Memories, memories Of holding hands and red bouquets
And twilights trimmed in purple haze
And laughing eyes and simple ways
And quiet nights and gentle days with you Memories, pressed between the pages of my mind
Memories, sweetened through the ages just like wine
Memories, memories, sweet memories, memories Return to sender, Return to sender

Hair of gold and the lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home Yes, they'll all come to meet me
Arms reachin', smiling sweetly
Oh, it's good to touch the green, green grass of home The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on Yeah, down the lane I'll walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and the lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home Yes, they'll all come to meet me
Arms reachin', smiling sweetly
Oh, it's good to touch the green, green grass of home Then I awake and look around me
At four gray walls that surround me
And I realize I was only dreamin' There's a guard and there's a sad old padre
Arm and arm we'll walk at daybreak again
I'll touch the green, green grass of home Yes, they'll all come to see me
In the shade of that old tree
As I lay me in the green, green grass of home Have I told you lately that I love you?
Could I tell you once again somehow?
Have I told with all my heart and soul how I adore you?
Well darling I'm telling you now Have I told you lately when I'm sleeping
Every dream I dream is you somehow?
Have I told you why the nights are long
When you're not with me?

Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never, ever walk alone Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart

Stuck on you Seven lonely days and a dozen towns ago
I reached out one night and you were gone
Don't know why you'd run, what you're running to or from
All I know is I want to bring you home So I'm walking in the rain, thumbing for a ride
On this lonely Kentucky back road
I've loved you much too long, my love's too strong
To let you go, never knowing what went wrong Kentucky rain keeps pouring down
And up ahead's another town that I'll go walking through
With the rain in my shoes (Rain in my shoes)
Searching for you
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain Showed your photograph to some old gray-bearded men
Sitting on a bench outside a general store
They said, "Yes, she's been here"
But their memory wasn't clear
Was it yesterday?
No, wait, the day before Finally got a ride with a preacher man who asked
"Where you bound on such a cold dark afternoon?"
As we drove on through the rain, as he listened, I explained
And he left me with a prayer that I'd find you Kentucky rain keeps pouring down
And up ahead's another town that I'll go walking through
With the rain in my shoes (Rain in my shoes)
Searching for you
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain You're sleeping son, I know
But, really, this can't wait
I wanted to explain
Before it gets too late For your mother and me
Love has finally died
This is no happy home
But God knows how I've tried Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy I know it's hard to understand
Why did we ever start?
We're more like strangers now
Each acting out a part I have laughed, I have cried
I have lost every game
Taken all I can take
But I'll stay just the same Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy Sleep on, you haven't heard a word
Perhaps it's just as well
Why spoil your little dreams
Why put you through the hell Life is no fairytale
As one day you will know
But now you're just a child
I'll stay her and watch you grow Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy Yeah, because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear falling on my ear
The song of God discloses And He walks with me
And He talks with me
And He tells me I am his own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known He speaks and the sound of His voice
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing
And the melody that He gave to me
Within my heart is ringing And He walks with me
And He talks with me
And He tells me I am his own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known One night with you
Is what I? m now praying for
The things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true Just call my name
And I? ll be right by your side
I want your sweet helping hand
My love's too strong to hide Always lived very quiet life

Now I know that life without you
Is being too lonely, too long One night with you
Is what I? m now praying for
The things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true Always lived very quiet life

Now I know that life without you
Is being too lonely, too long

On this, our wedding day I do love you with all my heart Kiss me quick, while we still have this feeling
Hold me close and never let me go
'Cause tomorrows can be so uncertain
Love can fly and leave hurting
Kiss me quick because I love you Kiss me quick and make my heart go grazy
Sight that sigh and whisper oh so low
Tell me that tonight will last forever
Say that you will leave me never
Kiss me quick because I love you so Let the band keep playing while we are swaying
Let's Keep on praying that we'll never stop Keep me quick I Just can't stand this waiting
'Cause you lips are lips I long to know
For that Kiss will open heaven's door
And we"ll stay there
forever more
Kiss me quick because I love you so Let the band keep playing while we are swaying
Let"s Keep on praying that we'll never stop
Kiss me quick I just can't stand this waiting
'Cause your lips are lips I long to know
For that Kiss will open heaven's door
And stay there forever more
Kiss me quick because I love you Once I stood in the night with my head bowed low
In the darkness as black as could be
And my heart felt alone and I cried,"Oh Lord
Don't hide Your face from me" Like a king I may live in a palace so tall
With great riches to call my own
But I don't know a thing in this whole wide world
That's worse than being alone Hold my hand all the way, every hour every day
Come here to the great unknown
Take my hand, let me stand
Where no one stands alone Take my hand, let me stand
Where no one stands alone I will spend my whole life through
Loving you
Just loving you
Winter, summer, spring time too
Loving you
Loving you Makes no difference where I go Or what I do
You know that I'll always be
Loving you, just you and
If I'm seen with someone new
Don't be blue
Don't you be blue
I'll be faithful, I'll be true
Always true, true to you There is only one for me,
And you know who
You know that, I'll always be
Loving you Aw, get on it I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind
I straddled that Greyhound and rode him into Raleigh
And on across Caroline We had motor trouble that turned into a struggle
Halfway across Alabam'
Well, that 'hound broke down and left us all stranded
In downtown Birmingham Right away I bought me a through train ticket
Right across Mississippi clean
I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smokin' into New Orleans Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
There are people there who care a little about me
And they won't let the poor boy down Take it Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
And put luggage in my hand
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land Workin' on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
When the pilot told us in 13 minutes
He would set us at the terminal gate Swing low, chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines and cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone Los Angeles, get me Norfolk, Virginia
Tidewater 4-1009
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land callin'
And the poor boy is on the line Workin' on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
When the pilot told us in 13 minutes
He would set us at the terminal gate Swing low, chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines and cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone Los Angeles, get me Norfolk, Virginia
Tidewater 4-1009

A fool about my money don't try to save
My heart says go, go have a time

I'm gonna shake it up, gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rip it up and ball tonight Well I got me a date and I won't be late
I picked her up in my '88
Shag on down by the social hall
When the joint starts jumpin', I'll have a ball I'm gonna rock it up, I'm gonna shake it up
I'm gonna rip it up, gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rip it up and ball tonight Along about 10 I'll be flying high
I walk on out in the open sky
But I don't care if I spend much dough
'Cause tonight I'm gonna be one happy soul I'm gonna rock it up, I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up, gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rip it up and ball tonight Well it's Saturday night and I just got paid
A fool about my money don't try to save
My heart says go, go have a time
'Cause it's Saturday night babe and I'm feelin' fine I'm gonna rock it up, I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up, gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rip it up and ball tonight Lord, help me walk
Another mile, just one more mile;
I'm tired of walkin' all alone. Lord, help me smile
Another smile, just one more smile;
I know I just can't make it on my own. I never thought I needed help before;
I thought that I could do things by myself.
Now I know I just can't take it any more.
With a humble heart, on bended knee,
I'm beggin' you, please, help me. Come down from your golden
Throne to me, to lowly me;
I need to feel the touch of your tender hand. Remove the chains of darkness
And let me see, lord let me see;
Just where I fit into your master plan. I never thought I needed help before;
I thought that I could do things by myself.
Now I know I just can't take it any more.
With a humble heart, on bended knee,
I'm beggin' you, please, help me. Well, that's all right, mama
That's all right for you
That's all right mama, just anyway you do
Well, that's all right, that's all right.
That's all right now mama, anyway you do
Mama she done told me,
Papa done told me too
'Son, that gal your foolin' with,
She ain't no good for you'
But, that's all right, that's all right.
That's all right now mama, anyway you do
I'm leaving town, baby
I'm leaving town for sure
Well, then you won't be bothered with
Me hanging 'round your door
Well, that's all right, that's all right.
That's all right now mama, anyway you do Well, well, well,
Just because you think you're so pretty,
And just because your momma thinks you're hot,
Well, just because you think you've got something
That no other girl has got,
You've caused me to spend all my money.
You laughed and called me old santa claus.
Well, I'm telling you,
Baby, I'm through with you.
Because, well well, just because. Well, well, well,
There'll come a time when you'll be lonesome
And there'll come a time when you'll be blue.
Well, there'll come a time when old santa
He won't pay your bills for you. You've caused me to lose all my women
And now, now you say we are through.
Well, I'm telling you
Baby, I was through with you
A long long time ago. Well, just because you think you're so pretty
And just because your mama thinks you're the hottest thing in
Town
Well, just because you think you've got something
That nobody else has got,
You've caused me to spend all of my money.
Honey, you laughed and called me your old santa claus.
Well, I'm telling you I'm through with you
Because, well well, just because. Born in the heat of the desert
My mother died giving me life
Deprived of the love of a father
Blamed for the loss of his wife
You know Lord I've been in a prison
For something that I never done
It's been one hill after another
I've climbed them all one by one But this time, Lord you gave me a mountain
A mountain you know I may never climb
It isn't just a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time My woman got tired of heartaches
Tired of the grief and the strife
So tired of working for nothing
Just tired of being my wife
She took my one ray of sunshine
She took my pride and my joy
She took my reason for living
She took my small baby boy But this time, Lord you gave me a mountain
A mountain you know I may never climb
It isn't just a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time He left the splendor of Heaven
Knowing His destiny
Was the lonely hill of Golgotha
There to lay down His life for me And if that isn't love
Then the ocean is dry
There's no stars in the sky
And the little sparrows can't fly Yeah, if that isn't love
Then Heaven's a myth
There's no feeling like this
If that isn't love Even in death He remembered
The thief hanging by His side
Then he spoke of love and compassion
And He took him to paradise And if that isn't love
Then the ocean is dry
There's no stars in the sky
And the little sparrows can't fly, ohh Yeah, if that isn't love
Then Heaven's a myth
There's no feeling like this
If that isn't love, it's got to be love When I was a child, ladies and gentlemen, I was a dreamer. 
I read comic books, and I was the hero of the comic book. I saw movies, and I 
was the hero in the movie.So every dream I ever dreamed has come true a hundred 
times. These gentlemen over there, these are the type who care, are dedicated. 
You realize if it's not possible that they might be building the kingdom, 
it's not far-fetched from reality. I'd like to say that I learned 
very early in life that: 
'Without a song the day would never end
Without a song a man ain't got a friend
Without a song the road would never bend
Without a song...'
So I keep singing a song.
Good night.
Thank you. Aloha-oe, aloha-oe, ikeona ona noho ikanipo
One fond embrace ahoea ea
Until we meet again
Until we meet again
Till we meet again Every man has a black star
A black star over his shoulder
And when a man sees his black star
He knows his time, his time has come Black star don't shine on me, black star
Black star keep behind me, black star
There's a lot of livin' I gotta do
Give me time to make a few dreams come true
Black star When I ride I feel that black star
That black star over my shoulder
So I ride in front of that black star
Never lookin' around, never lookin' around Black star don't shine on me, black star
Black star keep behind me, black star
There's a lot of livin' I gotta do
Give me time to make a few dreams come true
Black star One fine day I'll see that black star
That black star over my shoulder
And when I see that old black star
I'll know my time, my time has come Black star don't shine on me, black star
Black star keep behind me, black star
There's a lot of livin' I gotta do
Give me time to make a few dreams come true
Black star

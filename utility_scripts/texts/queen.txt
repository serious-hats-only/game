Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy
I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come
Easy go
Little high
Little low Any way the wind blows
Doesn't really matter to me
To me Mama
Just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama
Life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away Mama, ooh
Didn't mean to make you cry

Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time

For me

So you think you can love me and leave me to die?

Just gotta get out
Just gotta get right outta here (Ohh, Oh yeah, oh yeah)

And floating around in ecstasy So don't stop me now, don't stop me

Defying the laws of gravity

Alrigth Can anybody find me somebody to love? Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
(Take a look at yourself)
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord what you're doing to me
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord!
Somebody, somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love? I work hard (he works hard) every day of my life
I work 'till I ache in my bones
At the end (at the end of the day)
I take home my hard earned pay all on my own
I get down (down) on my knees (knees)
And I start to pray
Till the tears run down from my eyes
Lord somebody, somebody
(Please) can anybody find me somebody to love? (He works hard)
Everyday (everyday) I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm going crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
Got no common sense
I got nobody left to believe in Lord, somebody, somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
(Can anybody find me someone to love?) Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat (you just keep losing and losing)
I'm OK, I'm alright (he's alright, he's alright)
I ain't gonna face no defeat I just gotta get out of this prison cell
One day (someday) I'm gonna be free, Lord!
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love love love

Find me, find me, find me somebody to love
(Find me somebody to love)
Anybody, anywhere, anybody find me somebody to love love love!
Find me, find me, find me love Pressure, pushing down on me,
pressing down on you, no man ask for.
Under pressure that burns a building down,
splits a family in two, puts people on streets. It's the terror of knowing what this world is about.
Watching some good friends screaming, "let me out".
Tomorrow gets me higher.
Pressure on people, people on streets. Chippin' around, kick my brains around the floor.
These are the days, it never rains but it pours. People on streets.
People on streets. It's the terror of knowing what this world is about.
Watching some good friends screaming, "let me out".
Tomorrow gets me higher, higher, high!
Pressure on people, people on streets. Turned away from it all like a blind man.
Sat on a fence, but it don't work.
Keep comin' up with love, but it's so slashed and torn.
Why, why, why? Love (love, love, love, love).
Insanity laughs, under pressure we're cracking. Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love,
give love, give love, give love, give love, give love.
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word,
and love dares you to care for the people on the
edge of the night, and love dares you to
change our way of caring about ourselves.
This is our last dance.
This is ourselves. Under pressure.
Under pressure.
Pressure. I want to break free
I want to break free
I want to break free from your lies
You're so self satisfied I don't need you
I've got to break free
God knows, God knows I want to break free I've fallen in love

Uhhh... Uhhh... Let's go! Steve walks warily down the street
With his brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go Are you ready, hey, are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you when you're gone?
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, look out Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust Hey, another one bites the dust

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
Shoot out
There are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground You can beat him, you can cheat him
You can treat him bad and leave him
When he's down
But I'm ready, yes, I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating to the sound of the beat
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

Now I'm only left with my own jealousy Oh how strong can you be
With matters of the heart?
Life is much too short
To while away with tears
If only you could see
Just what you do to me
Oh jealousy you tripped me up Jealousy you brought me down
You bring me sorrow you cause me pain
Jealousy when will you let go? Gotta hold of my possessive mind
Turned me into a jealous guy
How how how all my jealousy
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy
But now it matters not
If I should live or die
'Cause I'm only left with my own jealousy. Ming: Klytus, I'm bored. What play thing can you offer me today?
Klytus: An obscure body in the S-K System, your majesty. The inhabitants refer to it as the planet Earth
Ming: How peaceful it looks
Ming: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

Himitsu wo Shiri tai You're wondering who I am
(Secret, secret, I've got a secret)
Machine or mannequin
(Secret, secret, I've got a secret)
With parts made in Japan
(Secret, secret, I've got a secret)
I am the modren man I've got a secret, I've been hiding under my skin
My heart is human, my blood is boiling
My brain I.B.M., so if you see me
Acting strangely, don't be surprised I'm just a man who needed someone
And somewhere to hide
To keep me alive, just keep me alive
Somewhere to hide to keep me alive I'm not a robot without emotions
I'm not what you see
I've come to help you
With your problems, so we can be free
I'm not a hero, I'm not a saviour
Forget what you know I'm just a man whose circumstances
Went beyond his control
Beyond my control, we all need control
I need control, we all need control I am the modren man

Who hides behind a mask
(Secret, secret, I've got a secret)

For helping me escape Just when I needed to
Thank you, thank you, thank you

Please, thank you, oh The problem's plain to see
Too much technology
Machines to save our lives
Machines, de-humanize The time has come at last

My true identity, I'm Kilroy, Kilroy, Kilroy, Kilroy Sometimes I get the feelin'
I was back in the old days long ago
When we were kids when we were young
Things seemed so perfect - you know
The days were endless we were crazy we were young
The sun was always shinin'
we just lived for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately
I just don't know
The rest of my life's been just a show Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true
When I look and I find I still love you You can't turn back the clock you can't turn back the tide
Ain't that a shame
I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game
No use in sitting and thinkin' on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately
I just don't know
Better sit back and go with the flow Cos these are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone now but some things remain
When I look and I find no change Those were the days of our lives, yeah
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing's still true
When I look and I find
I still love you
I still love you When I'm gone
Don't stop to wonder if I ever think of you
The same moon shines
The same wind blows
For both of us, and time is but a paper moon. . . be not gone Though I'm gone
It's just as though I hold the flower that touches you
A new life grows
The blossom knows
There's no one else could warm my heart as much as you. . . be not gone Let us cling together as the years go by
Oh my love, my love
In the quiet of the night
Let our candle always burn
Let us never lose the lessons we have learned Teo Torriate konomama iko
Aisuruhito yo
Shizukana yoi ni
Hikario tomoshi
Itoshiki oshieo idaki Hear my song
Still think of me the way you've come to think of me
The nights grow long
But dreams live on
Just close your pretty eyes and you can be with me. . . dream on When I'm gone
They'd say we're all fools and we don't understand
Oh be strong
Don't turn your heart
You're all
We're all
For all
For always. . I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds, invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry You made us feel like we could fly So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there
You had your time, you had the power You've yet to have your finest hour

Radio what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you! We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years Let's hope you never leave old friend
Like all good things on you we depend So stick around cos we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour

Radio It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
A kind of magic
One dream, one soul, one prize, one goal
One golden glance of what should be (it's a kind of magic)
One shaft of light that shows the way
No mortal man can win this day (it's a kind of magic)
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time (it's a kind of magic)
The waiting seems eternity
The day will dawn of sanity
Is this a kind of magic? (it's a kind of magic)
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done
This flame that burns inside of me I'm hearing secret harmonies (it's a kind of magic)
The bell that rings inside your mind Is challenging the doors of time
It's a kind of magic

It's a kind of magic
Magic magic magic magic
Ha ha ha haa - it's magic Ha haa
Yeah yeah
Wooh
It's a kind of magic I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be
Too many bitter tears are raining down on me
I'm far away from home
And I've been facing this alone for much too long
Oh, I feel like no-one ever told the truth to me
About growing up and what a struggle it would be
In my tangled state of mind
I've been looking back to find where I went wrong
Too much love will kill you
If you can't make up your mind Torn between the lover and the love you leave behind
You're headed for disaster 'cos you never read the signs
Too much love will kill you every time
I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be
And it seems like there's no way out of this for me
I used to bring you sunshine Now all I ever do is bring you down, oooh
How would it be if you were standing in my shoes
Can't you see that it's impossible to choose
No there's no making sense of it
Every way I go I'm bound to lose, oh yeah
Too much love will kill you
Just as sure as none at all
It'll drain the power that's in you Make you plead and scream and crawl
And the pain will make you crazy
You're the victim of your crime
Too much love will kill you every time
Yeah too much love will kill you
It'll make your life a lie
Yes too much love will kill you And you won't understand why
You'd give your life you'd sell your soul
But here it comes again
Too much love will kill you
In the end.
In the end. I want it all, I want it all
I want it all and I want it now Adventure seeker on an empty street

There's no reason for living with a broken heart This is a tricky situation
I've only got myself to blame
It's just a simple fact of life
It can happen to any one You win, you lose
It's a chance you have to take with love Yeah, I fell in love
But now you say it's over and I'm falling apart It's a hard life to be true lovers together
To love and live forever in each others hearts
It's a long hard fight to learn to care for each other
To trust in one another right from the start
When you're in love I try and mend the broken pieces
I try to fight back the tears
They say it's just a state of mind
But it happens to everyone How it hurts deep inside
When your love has cut you down to size
Life is tough on your own
Now I'm waiting for something to fall from the skies
I'm waiting for love Yes, it's a hard life, two lovers together
To love and live forever in each others hearts
It's a long hard fight to learn to care for each other
To trust in one another right from the start
When you're in love Yes, it's a hard life in a world that's filled with sorrow
There are people searching for love in every way
It's a long hard fight but I'll always live for tomorrow
I'll look back at myself and say I did it for love
Yes, I did it for love For love
I did it for love! Open up your mind and let me step inside
Rest your weary head and let your heart decide
It's so easy when you know the rules
It's so easy all you have to do
Is fall in love
Play the game
Everybody play the game of love Ooh yeah

An angel reaching for the sky
Is it raining in Heaven
Do you want us to cry? And everywhere the broken hearted
On every lonely avenue
No one could reach them
No one but you One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flying too close to the sun
And life goes on
Without you Another tricky situation
I get the drownin' in the Blues
And I find myself thinkin'
Well, what would you do? Yes, it was such an operation
Forever paying every due
Hell, you made a sensation
You found a way through One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flyin' too close to the sun
We'll remember
Forever And now the party must be over
I guess we'll never understand
The sense of your leaving
Was in the way it was planned? And so we grace another table
And raise our glasses one more time
There's a face at the window
And I ain't never, never sayin' goodbye
And it's one by one
Only the good die young
They're only flyin' too close to the sun
Cryin' for nothing
Cryin' for no one
No one but you Lately, I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through, wow
Are you reaching out for me
Like I'm reaching out for you? Every drop of rain that falls
in Sahara Desert says it all
It's a miracle
All God's creations great and small
The Golden Gate and the Taj Mahal
That's a miracle
Test tube babies being born
Mothers, fathers dead and gone
It's a miracle We're having a miracle on earth
Mother nature does it all for us
The wonders of this world go on
The hanging Gardens of Babylon
Captain Cook and Cain and Able
Jimi Hendrix to the Tower of Babel
It's a miracle
it's a miracle
it's a miracle It's a miracle The one thing we're all waiting for
is peace on earth, an end to war It's a miracle we need, the miracle
The miracle we're all waiting for today If every leaf on every tree
could tell a story that would be a miracle
If every child on every street
had clothes to wear and food to eat
That's a miracle If all God's people could be free
to live in perfect harmony
It's a miracle We're having a miracle on earth
Mother nature does it all for us
Open hearts and surgery
(wonders of this world go on)
Sunday mornings with a cup of tea
Super powers always fighting But Mona Lisa just keeps on smiling
It's a miracle
it's a miracle
it's a miracle
(wonders of this world go on) It's a miracle
it's a miracle
it's a miracle

That time will come one day you'll see

That time will come one day you'll see
when we can all be friends
That time will come one day you'll see
when we can all be friends
That time will come one day you'll see
when we can all be friends... I think i'm going back
to the things i learnt so well in my youth
i think i'm returning to those days when i was young enough to know the truth
now there are no games
to only pass the time
no more colouring books no christmas bells to chime
but thinking young and growing older is no sin and i can't play the game of life to win
i can recall a time
when i wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend
and now i think i've got a lot more than just my toys to lend
now there's more to do
than watch my sailboat glide
and every day can be my magic carpet ride
and i can play hide and seek with my fears and live my days instead of counting my years
then everyone debates
the true reality
i'd rather see the world
the way it used to be
a little bit of freedom's all we lack
so catch me if you can
i'm going back I can dim the lights and sing you songs full of sad things
We can do the tango just for two
I can serenade and gently play on your heart strings
Be your Valentino just for you Ooh love, ooh loverboy
What you doing tonight? (oooh, hey boy)
Set my alarm, turn on my charm
That's because I'm a good old fashioned loverboy Ooh, let me feel your heartbeat (grow faster, faster)
(Ooh, ooh), can you feel my love heat
Come on and sit on my hot seat of love
And tell me how do you feel right after all
I'd like for you and I to go romancing
Say the word, your wish is my command Ooh love, ooh loverboy
What you doing tonight? (ooh, hey boy)
Write my letter
We're much better
And use my fancy patter on the telephone Yeah
When I'm not with you
Think of you always
I miss you
When I'm not with you
Think of me always I love you, love you
Hey boy, where do you get it from?
Hey boy, where did you go?
I learned my passion In the good old fashioned school of loverboys
Dining at the Ritz we'll meet at nine, (one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine o'clock) precisely
I will pay the bill, you taste the wine
Driving back in style in my saloon will do quite nicely
Take me back to yours that will be fine Come on and get it
Ooh love, ooh loverboy
What're you doing tonight? Hey boy
Everything's all right
Just hold on tight
That's because I'm a good old fashioned, fashioned
Lover boy One dance whose steps I never could learn
It's called The Wedding March
The grace that it takes, the grace you deserve,
Require a lighter touch
I know you love dancing.
Oh, I know that you love dancing so much
I know you love dancing.
Music's a wild thing with mischief to prove
I can't adjust to the way that you move
Music's a wild thing whatever the groove
Some music isn't for dancing
One dance whose steps I never could learn
It's called The Wedding March
The grace that it takes, the balance and poise,
I still find a mystery
I know you love dancing.
So, I know that you'd hate dancing with me
I know you love dancing.
So, I know that you'd hate dancing with me In the year of '39 assembled here the volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
The sweetest sight ever seen And the night followed day
And the story tellers say
That the score brave souls inside
Um, for many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
Never looked back, never feared, never cried Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue
The volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavenly weigh
For the earth is old and grey, little darling went away
But my love this cannot be
For so many years have gone though I'm older but a year
Your mothers eyes from your eyes cry to me Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
All your letters in the sand
Cannot heal me like your hand
For my life still ahead - pity me You and me we are destined
You'll agree
To spend the rest of our lives with each other
The rest of our days like two lovers For ever - yeah - for ever
My bijou Ooh-oh-oh-ooh
Ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh, take it, take it all away
Ooh-oh-oh-ooh, ooh-ooh, take my breath away, oooh
Oh-oh-oh-ooh, oooh, you-ooh-ooh-ooh take my breath away Look into my eyes and you'll see
I am the only one
You've captured my love
Stolen my heart
Changed my life Everytime you make a move
You destroy my mind
And the way you touch
I lose control and shiver deep inside
You take my breath away You can reduce me to tears
With a single sigh (please don't cry anymore)
Every breath that you take
Any sound that you make
Is a whisper in my ear I could give up all my life for just one kiss
I would surely die
If you dismiss me from your love
You take my breath away So please don't go
Don't leave me here all by myself
I get ever so lonely from time to time
I will find you
Anywhere you go
I'll be right behind you (oooh, oooh, oooh)
Right until the ends of the earth (ahhhhh)
I'll get no sleep till I find you
To tell you that you just
Take my breath away I will find you
Anywhere you go, oooh, oooh, oooh
Right until the ends of the earth (ahhhhh)
I'll get no sleep till I find you
To tell you when I've found you
I love you Take my breath, take my breath, take my breath
Take my breath, take my breath, take my breath
Take my breath, take my breath, take my breath
Take my breath, take my breath, take my breath
Take my breath, take my breath, take my breath
Take my breath, take my breath, take my breath

La da da da daah
Da da da haa
Ha da da ha ha haaa
Ha da daa ha da da aaa Sammy was low,
just watching the show,
over and over again.
He knew it was time,
he'd made up his mind,
to leave his dead life behind. His boss said to him
boy, you'd better begin
to get those crazy notions
right out of your head
Sammy who do you think that you are?
You should have been sweeping
up the emerald bar. Spread Your Wings and fly away,
fly away, far away.
Spread your little wings and fly away
fly away, far away.
Pull yourself together,
'cause you know you should do better,
that's because you're a free man. He spends his evenings alone,
in his hotelroom.
Keeping his thoughts to himself,
he'd be leaving soon.
Wishing he was miles and miles away,
nothing in this world, nothing,
would make him stay. Since he was small,
had no luck at all,
nothing came easy to him.
Now it was time,
he'd made up his mind,
this could be my last chance
His boss said to him
now listen boy, you're always dreaming,
you got no real ambition,
you won't get worried for.
Sammy, boy don't you know who you are?
why can't you be happy,
at the emerald bar? (So honey) spread you wings and fly away,
fly away, far away.
spread your little wings and fly away,
fly away, far away.
pull yourself together,
'cause you know you should do better,
that's because your a free man.
come on honey (fly with me)... Happy little day
Jimmy went away
Met his little Jenny on a
public holiday
A happy pair they made
so decorously laid
'Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade
"It's so good to know there's still a little
magic in the air
I'll
weave my spell"
"Jenny will you stay
tarry with me pray Nothing 'ere need come between us tell me love, what do you say"
"Oh no I must away to my Mum in disarray
If my mother should discover how I spent my holiday
It would be of small avail to talk of
magic in the air
I'll say farewell"
O Rock of Ages
do not crumble
love is breathing still
O Lady Moon shine down
a little people magic if you will
Jenny pines away
writes a letter everyday
"We must ever be together
nothing can my love erase"
"Oh no I'm compromised
I must apologize
If my lady should discover
how I spent my holidays..."
ooohh ooo ooo If you're searching out for something
Don't try so hard
If you're feeling kind of nothing
Don't try so hard When your problems seem like mountains
Feel the need to find some answers
You can leave them for another day
Don't try so hard But if you fall and take a tumble
It won't be far
If you fail you mustn't grumble
Thank your lucky stars Just savour every mouthful
And treasure every moment
When the storms are ranging round you
Stay right where you are Don't try so hard
Don't take it all to heart
It's only fools, they make these rules
Don't try so hard One day you'll be a sergeant major
You'll be so proud
Screaming out your bloody orders
Hey! but not too loud Polish all your shiny buttons
Dressed as lamb instead of mutton
But you never had to try
To stand out from the crowd What a beautiful world
This is the life for me
What a beautiful world
Is the simple life for me Don't try so hard
Don't take it all to heart
It's only fools, they make these rules
Don't try so hard
Don't try so hard Here I stand
Look around around around around
But you won't see me
Now I'm here
Now I'm there
I'm just a just a new man
Yes you made me live again
A baby I was when you took my hand And the light of the night burned bright
And the people all stared didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight
Whatever came of you and me?
America's new bride to be
Don't worry baby I'm safe and sound
Down in the dungeon just Peaches and me
Don't I love her so?
Yes she made me live again Yeah!
A thin moon me in the smoke screen sky Where the beams of your love light chase
Don't move don't speak don't feel no pain
With the rain running down my face
Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye
Down in the city just Hoople and me
Don't I love him so don't I love him so?
Whatever comes of you and me I love to leave my memories with you
Now I'm here Think I'll stay around around around
Down in the city just you and me
Don't I love you so?
Go, go, go, little Queenie Love don't give no compensation
Love don't pay no bills
Love don't give no indication
Love just won't stand still Love kills, drills you through your heart
Love kills, scars you from the start
It's just a living pastime, ruining your heartline

Coz love, love, love won't leave you alone Love don't take no reservations
Love is no square deal
Hey love don't give no justification

It won't let go, it won't let go
Love kills Love kills drills you through your heart
Love kills I don't want to sleep with you
I don't need the passion too
I don't want a stormy affair
To make me feel my life is heading somewhere All I want is the comfort and care
Just to know that my woman gives me sweet mother love I've walked too long in this lonely lane
I've had enough of this same old game
I'm a man of the world and they say that I'm strong
But my heart is heavy, and my hope is gone Out in the city, in the cold world outside
I don't want pity, just a safe place to hide
Mama please, let me back inside I don't want to make no waves
But you can give me all the love that I crave
I can't take it if you see me cry
I long for peace before I die All I want is to know that you're there
You're gonna give me all your sweet mother love Mother love My body's aching, but I can't sleep
My dreams are all the company I keep
Got such a feeling as the sun goes down
I'm coming home to my sweet mother love Mother love
Mother love Day oh

It's the sad eyed goodbye
yesterday's moments i remember
it's the bleak street, week kneed partings i recall
it's the mistier mists the hazier days
the brighter sun and the easier lays
there's all the more reason for laughing and crying
when you're younger and life isn't to hard at all
It's the fantastic drowse
of the afternoon sundays
that bored you to rages of tears
the unending pleadings
to waste all your good times
in thoughts of your middle-aged years
it's the vertical hold all the things that you're told
for the everyday hero it all turns to zero
and there's all the more reason
for living or dying when you're young
and your troubles are all very small
Out here on the street we'd gather and meet
and scuff up the sidewalk
with endlessly restless feet
half on the time we'd broaden our minds
more in the pool hall
than we did in the school hall
with the down town chewing gum bums
watching the night life the lights and the fun
Never wanted to be the boy next door
always thought i'd be something more
but it ain't easy for a small town boy
it ain't easy at all
thinkin' it right and doin' it wrong
it's easier from an arm chair
waves of alternatives wash over my sleepiness
have my eggs poached for breakfast i guess
I think i'll be clint eastwood
jimi hendrix he was good
let's try william the conqueror
now who else do i like? This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
this could be heaven for everyone
In these days of cool reflection (reflection) You come to me and everything seems alright
In these days of cold affections
You sit by me and everything's fine
This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed
this world could be fun
This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be free this world could be one
In this world of cool deception
Just your smile can smooth my ride
These troubled days of cruel rejection
You come to me, soothe my troubled mind
Yeah this could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed
this world could be fun This should be love for everyone (yeah)
This world should be free
this world could be one
We should bring love to our daughters and sons
Love, love, love, love
This could be heaven for everyone
You know that
(this could be heaven for everyone) Yes!
(this could be heaven for everyone)
This could be heaven for everyone
Listen.
What people do to other souls
They take their lives, destroy their goals
Their basic pride and dignity
Is stripped and torn and shown no pity
When this should be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven
this could be heaven
This could be heaven for everyone This could be heaven
could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven
(this could be heaven)
This could be heaven
could be heaven for everyone This could be heaven
(this could be heaven)
This could be heaven
could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven
This could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven...
For everyone
For everyone Words and music by Brian May and Tim Staffell In the bright shop window sits the polar bear
Makes the children's eyes light up to see him there
Amongst the tinsel he gives everyone a smile
To see him as you'd see a star
Love him from where you are
He's not for, not for, not for sale
Past an open window walks the pretty girl
Does she see me at her feet it's hard to tell
But if I ask her she might turn her smile away
To see her as I'd see a star
Love her from where you are
She's not for, not for, not for sale
I guess I'll learn to look
Without a grasping hand
Minor contentment wears a smile
I love her from where I lie
He's not for, not for, not for sale
Not for sale Sometimes I get the feelin'
I was back in the old days long ago
When we were kids when we were young
Things seemed so perfect - you know
The days were endless we were crazy we were young
The sun was always shinin'
we just lived for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately
I just don't know
The rest of my life's been just a show Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true
When I look and I find I still love you You can't turn back the clock you can't turn back the tide
Ain't that a shame
I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game
No use in sitting and thinkin' on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately
I just don't know
Better sit back and go with the flow Cos these are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone now but some things remain
When I look and I find no change Those were the days of our lives, yeah
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing's still true
When I look and I find
I still love you
I still love you Time waits for nobody
Time waits for nobody
We all must plan our hopes together
Or we'll have no more future at all
Time waits for nobody We might as well be deaf and dumb and blind
I know that sounds unkind
But it seems to me we've not listened to
Or spoken about it at all
The fact that time is running out for us all Time waits for nobody
Time waits for no-one
We've got to build this world together
Or we'll have no more future at all
Because time - it waits for nobody You don't need me to tell you what's gone wrong (gone wrong gone wrong)
You know what's going on
But it seems to me we've not cared enough
Or confided in each other at all (confided in each other at all)
It seems that we've all got our backs against the wall (Time) Time waits for nobody
(Time) waits for no-one
We've got to trust in one another
Or there'll be no more future at all
(Time) Yeah - Time waits for nobody
No no - Time don't wait for no-one
Let's learn to be friends with one another
Or there'll be no more future at all Time (time) time (time) waits for nobody waits for nobody
Time time time time waits for nobody at all Time waits for nobody - yeah
Time don't wait - waits for no-one
Let us free this world for ever
And build a brand new future for us all Time waits for nobody nobody nobody
For no-one When love breaks up
When the dawn light wakes up
A new life is born
Somehow I have to make this final breakthru...
Now!
I wake up
Feel just fine
Your face
Fills my mind
I get religion quick
'Cos you're looking divine
Honey you're touching something, you're touchin' me
I'm under your thumb, under your spell, can't you see?
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you That would really be a breakthru - oh yeah Breakthru, these barriers of pain
Breakthru, yeah, to the sunshine from the rain
Make my feelings known towards you
Turn my heart inside and out for you now
Somehow I have to make this final breakthru Now! (Now now now)
Oh yeah Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Your smile
Speaks books to me
I break up
With each and every one of your looks at me
Honey you're starting something deep inside of me Honey you're sparking something, this fire in me
I'm outta control
I wanna rush headlong into this ecstasy If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you - ooh ooh ooh ooh
That would really be a breakthru
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru
Oh yeah
Breakthru, breakthru If I could only reach you

Breakthru Oh oh people of the earth
Listen to the warning
The Seer he said
Beware the storm that gathers here
Listen to the wise man I dreamed I saw on a moonlit stair
Spreading his hands on the multitude there A man who cried for a love gone stale
And ice cold hearts of charity bare
I watched as fear took the old men's gaze
Hopes of the young in troubled graves
I see no day, I heard him say
So grey is the face of every mortal Oh oh people of the earth
Listen to the warning
The prophet he said
For soon the cold of night will fall
Summoned by your own hand Oh oh children of the land
Quicken to the new life
Take my hand
Ooh, fly and find the new green bough
Return like the white dove He told of death as a bone white haze
Taking the lost and the unloved babe
Late too late all the wretches run
These kings of beasts now counting their days From mother's love is the son estranged
Married his own his precious gain
The earth will shake in two will break
And death all around will be your dow'ry Oh oh people of the earth
Listen to the warning the seer he said
For those who hear and mark my words
Listen to the good plan Oh oh oh oh - and two by two my human zoo
They'll be
Running for to come
Running for to come
Out of the rain Oh, flee for your life
Who heed me not, let all your treasure make you
Oh, fear for your life
Deceive you not the fires of hell will take you
Should death await you Oh, oh, people can you hear me (oh, oh, people can you hear me)

In the shadow of the mushroom cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder and louder louder What the hell we fighting for?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all

Alright Oo-oo-oooh Music is playing in the darkness
And a lantern goes swinging by
Shadow's flickering
My heart's jittering
Just you and I Not tonight

When everything's sunny and bright (sunny and bright)
No, no, no, come tomorrow
Cos' then we'll be waiting for the moonlight

People drinking for days gone by
Time don't mean a thing
When you're by my side
Please stay a while Oooh, you know I never could foresee the future years (do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do)
You know I never could see where life was leading me (do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do)
But will we be together (do, do), for ever (ever)
What will be my love, can't you see that I just don't know, don't know No, no, no, not tonight, come tomorrow
Everything's gonna be sunny and bright
Wait and see if tomorrow
We'll be as happy as we feel tonight (We'll go walking), oh, we'll be happy, we'll be happy (walking in the moonlight)
(Walking in the moonlight) I can hear the music in the darkness
Floating softly to where we lie
No more questions now
Let's enjoy tonight
Just you and I
Oooh, just you and
I Just you and I Can't you see that we've gotta be together, be together
Just you and I, just you and I No more questions now
Just you and I
Come on, come on Take off
I was told a million times
Of all the troubles in my way
Tried to grow a little wiser
Little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Bread and butter for a smile
Well I sold a million mirrors
In a shopping alley way
But I never saw my face
In any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you
Be a super star
But I tell you just be satisfied
Stay right where you are Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and money
To keep me satisfied Well I've loved a million women
In a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners
Brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need
To feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger
Maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times
Of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying
And get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Same as when I started Keep yourself alive, come on
Keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and money
Keep yourself alive Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and money
Honey, you'll survive Do you think you're better every day?
No, I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Come on, keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive Fear me you lord and lady preachers
I descend upon your earth from the skies
I command your very souls you unbelievers
Bring before me what is mine Can you hear me you peers and privy councillors
I stand before you naked to the eyes
I will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust
I swear that you'll be mine
At the seven seas of Rhye Sister I live and lie for you
Mister do and I'll die
You are mine I possess you
Belong to you forever Storm the master marathon I'll fly through
By flash and thunder fire I'll survive
I'll survive I'll survive
Then I'll defy the laws of nature
And come out alive Begone with you you shod and shady senators
Give out the good leave out the bad evil cries
I challenge the mighty titan and his troubadours
And with a smile
I'll take you to the seven seas of Rhye Oh oh... (...)

Please come now, I think I'm falling
But I'm holding on to all
I think is safe
It seems I found the road to nowhere
And I'm trying to escape
I yelled back when I heard thunder
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it let me say, let me say Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinking maybe six feet Ain't so far down I'm looking down now that it's over
Reflecting on all of my mistakes
I thought
I found the road to somewhere
Somewhere in His grace I cried out, "Heaven, save me"
But I'm down to one last breath And with it let me say, let me say
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinking maybe six feet
Ain't so far down Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinking maybe six feet Ain't so far down
I'm so far down Sad eyes follow me
But I still believe there's
Something left for me
So, please, come stay with me 'Cause I still believe there's
Something left for you and me
For you and me
For you and me
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinking

wide open When dreaming, I'm guided to another world, time and time again
At sunrise, I fight to stay asleep
'Cause I don't want to leave the comfort of this place
'Cause there's a hunger, a longing to escape
From the life I live when I'm awake
So let's go there, let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask "can we stay?" Can you take me higher
to a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
to a place with golden streets?
Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate those nights and those dreams
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same The only difference is, to let love replace all our hate
So let's go there, let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there Let's ask "can we stay?"

Can you take me higher
to a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher
to a place with golden streets? Court is in session
A verdict is in
No appeal on the docket today Just my own sin
The walls, cold and pale The cage made of steel
Screams fill the room
Alone, I drop and kneel
Silence now the sound My breath the only motion around
Demons cluttering around
My face showing no emotion Shackled by my sentence
Expecting no return
Here there is no penance
My skin begins to burn (And I said, ohh)
So I held my head up high
Hiding hate that burns inside Which only fuels their selfish pride
(And I said, ohh)
All held captive out from the sun A sun that shines on only some
We, the meek are all in one I hear a thunder in the distance
See a vision of a cross
I feel the pain that was given
On a sad day of loss A lion roars in the darkness
Only he holds the key
A light to free me from my burden
And grant me life eternally Should have been dead
On a Sunday morning Banging my head
No time for mourning
Ain't got no time
Should have been dead On a Sunday morning
Banging my head
No time for mourning Ain't got no time
(And I said, ohh)
So I held my head up high Hiding hate that burns inside
Which only fuels their selfish pride
(And I said, ohh) All held captive out from the sun
A sun that shines on only some
We are meek, are all in one
I cry out to God Seeking only His decision
Gabriel stand and confirms
I've created my own prison I cry out to God
Seeking only His decision
Gabriel stand and confirms
I've created my own prison
(And I said, ohh)
So I held my head up high
Hiding hate that burns inside
Which only fuels their selfish pride
(And I said, ohh)
All held captive out from the sun
A sun that shines on only some
We are meek, are all in one
(And I said, ohh)
So I held my head up high
Hiding hate that burns inside
Which only fuels their selfish pride
(And I said, ohh)
All held captive out from the sun
A sun that shines on only some
We are meek, are all in one
Should have been dead
On a Sunday morning
Banging my head
No time for mourning
Ain't got no time Hurray for a child that makes it through
If there's any way because the answer lies in you
They're laid to rest before they've known just what to do
Their souls are lost because They could never find What's this life for? What's this life for?
What's this life for? What's this life for? I see your soul, it's kind of gray
You see my heart, you look away
You see my wrist, I know your pain
I know your purpose on your plane
Don't say a last prayer because You could never find What's this life for? What's this life for?
What's this life for? What's this life for? But they ain't here anymore
Don't have to settle the score
'Cause we all live under the reign
Of one king But they ain't here anymore
Don't have to settle no goddamn score
'Cause we all live under the reign
Of just as you know of one king, one king, one king But they ain't here anymore
Don't have to settle no goddamn score
'Cause we all live under the reign
Of just as you know of one king, one king, one king
But they ain't here anymore
Don't have to settle no goddamn score
'Cause we all live under the reign
Of one king I lie awake on a long dark night
I can't seem to tame my mind
Slings and arrows are killin' me inside
Maybe I can't accept the life that's mine
No, maybe I can't accept the life that's mine Simple livin' is my desperate cry
Been tradin' love with indifference
An', yeah, it suits me just fine
I try to hold on but I'm calloused to the bone
Maybe that's why I feel alone, yeah
Maybe that's why I feel so alone 'Cause me, I'm rusted and weathered
Barely holdin' together
I'm covered with skin that peels
And it just won't heal
I am rusted and weathered
Barely holdin' together I'm covered with skin that peels
And it just won't heal
No, it just won't heal, no, no, no
The sun shines and I can't avoid the light
I think I'm holdin' on to life too tight Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Sometimes I feel like givin' up, yeah
I said, sometimes I feel like givin' up
'Cause me, I'm rusted and weathered
Barely holdin' together
I'm covered with skin that peels And it just won't heal
I am rusted and weathered
Barely holdin' together
I'm covered with skin that peels
And it just won't heal
It just won't heal, no
The day reminds me of you
The night hides your truth
The earth is a voice
Speaking to you
Take all this pride
And leave it behind
'Cause one day it ends One day we die
Believe what you will
That is your right
But I choose to win
I choose to fight, to fight
'Cause me I'm rusted and weathered
Barely holdin' together
I'm covered with skin that peels
And it just won't heal
I am rusted and weathered
Barely holdin' together
I'm covered with skin that peels
And It just won't
Covered with skin that peels
And it just won't
Covered with skin that peels
And it just won't heal Hey Mr. Seeker
Hold on to this advice
If you can seek then you will find Don't want to follow

It's safe to say that I'm stuck again
Trapped between this life and the light
I just can't figure out, how to make it right A thousand times before
I've wondered if there's something more Something more
I feel it's gonna rain like this for days
So let it rain down and wash everything away
I hope that tomorrow the sun will shine With every tomorrow comes another life
I feel it's gonna rain for days and days
I feel it's gonna rain
I tried to figure out I can't understand
What it means to be whole again
Trapped between the truth and the consequence Nothing's real nothing's making sense
A thousand times before I've wondered if there's something more
Something more
I feel it's gonna rain like this for days
So let it rain down and wash everything away I hope that tomorrow the sun will shine
I feel it's going to rain like this Rain like this
Rain like this
Fall down
Wash away my yesterdays Fall down
So let the rain fall down on me
I feel it's gonna rain like this for days
Let it rain down and wash everything away I hope that tomorrow the sun will shine
I feel it's going to rain like this
Rain like this
So let the rain fall down
I feel it's gonna rain this
Rain like this
So let the rain fall down
I feel it's gonna rain like this

To ease my troubled mind
I left my body laying somewhere
In the sands of time
I watched the world float
To the dark side of the moon
I feel there is nothing I can do, yeah
I watched the world float
To the dark side of the moon
After all I knew it had to be
Something to do with you
I really dont mind what happens now and then
As long as youll be my friend at the end
If I go crazy then will you still
Call me superman
If Im alive and well, will you be
There holding my hand
Ill keep you by my side
With my superhuman I ain't
Kryptonite
You called me strong, you called me weak,
But still your secrets I will keep
You took for granted all the times
I never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head, If not for me then you would be dead
I picked you up and put you back
On solid ground
If I go crazy then will you still
Call me superman

Holding my hand
Ill keep you by my side
With my superhuman I ain't
Kryptonite The rage in my eyes
Could have compared to the eye of the sun
Then rain
Took its course through the hands of the son
Revenge for all time
The world is at war leaving all hope (fault?) behind So, is this the end for us my friend?
So, is this the end for us my friend?
The stains in the sky
Are there to remind us of man and his fight(?)
When two worlds collide
One steals a life like a thief in the night
So look to the sky
He holds the keys for your life
And mine So, is this the end for us my friend?
So, is this the end for us my friend?
So, is this the end for us my friend? Well, as the wind rides (Well as though we rise?)
As the day breaks the dawn
And as the moon hides the sun
Oh the sun
No more sorrow
All those crying days are gone
No more sorrow now its gone
Now it's gone
Now it's gone So, is this the end for us my friend? So, is this the end for us my friend?
So, is this the end for us my friend?
So, is this the end for us my friend?
So, is this the end for us my friend? The eyes around me are so cold
With every chance they steal my soul
So walk with me, Talk with me,
Hold my hand I'm stumbling
In consequence here is me alive Can you fix what's made to be broken
I can't fix what's made to be My Heart is tattooed on my sleeve
I'm not hiding
No
It only hurts to breathe My Heart is tattooed on my sleeve
I know it's blinding
No
It only hurts to breathe Standing now and alone
I need answers tell me everything you know
So heavy is the night
Exhausted
Whispers tend to crucify my mind
I'm fighting but I'm blind Can you fix what's made to be broken
I can't fix what's made to be My Heart is tattooed on my sleeve
I'm not hiding
No
It only hurts to breathe My Heart is tattooed on my sleeve
I know it's blinding
No
It only hurts,

I'm not hiding
No
It only hurts to breathe My Heart is tattooed on my sleeve
I know it's blinding
No
It only hurts,
It only hurts,
It only hurts to breathe To what do I owe this gift my friend?
My life?
My love?
My soul?
I've been dancing with the devil way too long
And it's making me grow old
Making me grow old Let's leave, oh, let's get away
Get lost in time
Where there's no reason left to hide Let's leave, oh, let's get away
Run in fields of time
Where there's no reason left to hide
No reason to hide What are you going to do with your gift dear child?
Give life?
Give love?
Give soul?
Divided is the one who dances
For the soul is so exposed
So exposed Let's leave, oh, let's get away
Get lost in time
Where there's no reason left to hide Let's leave, oh, let's get away
Run in fields of time
Where there's no reason left to hide
No reason to hide There is no reason to hide
There is no reason to hide
There is no reason to hide
There is no reason to hide Let's leave, oh, let's get away
Get lost in time
Where there's no reason left to hide Let's leave, oh, let's get away
Run in fields of time
Where there's no reason left to hide Let's leave, oh, let's get away
Get lost in time
Where there's no reason left to hide No reason to hide
There is no reason to hide
No reason to hide
There is no reason to hide
No reason to hide I stand surrounded by the walls that once confined me.
Knowing I'll be underneath them when they crumble, when they fall.
With clarity my scars remind me
Ash still simmers just under my skin
Indifference smiles again
So much I hide
How is stepping back a move forward? Now I'm forced to look behind
I'm forced to look at you
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Broken mirrors paint the floor
Why can't you see the truth?
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you. Tell me which is you. Eerilly time made no change
Pointing fingers, laying blame.
Lying over and over and over and over.
Decieving your mind
Dug my grave, trashed my name
Yet here I stand, so you won't fade away
Indifference smiles again So much I hide
How is stepping back a move forward? Now I'm forced to look behind
I'm forced to look at you
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Broken mirrors paint the floor
Why can't you see the truth? You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you.
Tell me which is you. I bleed inside
(I bleed)
Just let it out
(You got to let it out) Just let it out
(You got to let it out, that bullshit)
I bleed inside
(Inside)
Just let it out
(You got to let it out)
Just let it out
(Just let it out)
Let it die!
Now I'm forced to look behind
I'm forced to look at you
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Broken mirrors paint the floor
Why can't you tell the truth?
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me which is you.
Tell me which is you. When I'm all alone
And no one else is there
Waiting by the phone
To remind me I'm still here
When shadows paint the scenes
Where spotlights use to fall
And I'm left wondering
Is it really worth it all? There's a peace inside us all
Let it be your friend
It will help you carry on
In the end
There's a peace inside us all Life can hold you down
When you're not looking out
Can't you hear the sounds
Hearts beating out loud
Although the names change
Inside we're all the same
Why can't we tear down the walls,
And show the scars we're covering?
There's a peace inside us all Let it be your friend
It will help you carry on
In the end
There's a peace inside us all There's a peace
Oh, there's a peace inside us all
Let it be
Oh I said let it be your friend
Oh, can't it be your friend? He said he's falling to pieces
Fighting the boy and the man
Over his shoulder there was freedom
But consciousness has tied his hands
Embodied youth was his distinction
Now inhibition's in demand
So driven by his fear of weakness
That's his key to understand
So far in a distant land
There's a fight between boy and man
See the light through the open door
Sit and watch as the young grow old
Trading places in the circle
Turn the glass, spill the sand
They say that time can make the difference
But age doesn't make you a man
So far in a distant land
There's a fight between boy and man
See the light through the open door
Sit and watch as the young grow old
So young but overblown
So young but overblown
So young but overblown
Take a look now, see the boy is weakened
Watch him fade, watch him fade away
Take a bow and the boy is defeated
Is this the way, this the way?
So far in a distant land
There's a fight between boy and man
See the light through the open door
Sit and watch as the young grow old A nature to nurture
An instinct to sin
What's under me
The skin you live in
You trade your unlimited
Your precious creation
You will submit
You will get it Suddenly I have no strength at all
So suddenly hit with all I've lost
Suddenly my world, is falling apart
So suddenly so suddenly
Suddenly You say you're a victim
But that's just a symptom
You're so very clear
You volunteered
Why are you fighting just stop your denying
Own up to the sin
You bury within Suddenly I have no strength at all
So suddenly hit with all I've lost
Suddenly my world, is falling apart
So suddenly so suddenly
Suddenly I have no strength at all
I've been hit with a loss
So suddenly my world falls apart
I have no strength at all
I've been hit with a loss
Suddenly my world falls apart
My world, falls apart Suddenly I have no strength at all
So suddenly hit with all I've lost
Suddenly my world, is falling apart
So suddenly so suddenly
Suddenly Suddenly I have no strength at all
So suddenly hit
So suddenly hit
Suddenly my world falls apart
So suddenly so suddenly
Suddenly I can't explain
Can't quite put my finger on it
The difference that makes us so different
We've said everything
Our words only betrayed us
Nothing is left, nothing was left unsaid This time I have nothing left to lose
I'm stuck the second hand won't move
Its about time I speak my mind
Its about time, about time I find
Pieces of me I have lost
Without any choice I move on
Hey time you're no friend of mine
Hey time you're no friend of mine You cover yourself you cover your skin
Your cover yourself like you cover your sins
Please untie my hands
I'm a sinner, I'm a man
I ask for one minute to make you understand This time I have nothing left to lose
I'm stuck the second hand won't move
Its about time I speak my mind
Its about time, about time I find
Pieces of me I have lost
Without any choice I move on
Hey time you're no friend of mine
Hey time you're no friend of mine Will you be there
To catch when I stumble when I fall
When I fall
Its so very clear
You left me when I had no one at all
No one at all Who will be there
To catch me, to catch me when I stumble
When I fall, when I fall
Its so very clear
You left me with no one at all
No one at all This time I have nothing left to lose
I'm stuck the second hand won't move
Its about time I speak my mind
Its about time, about time I find
Pieces of me I have lost
Without any choice I move on
Hey time you're no friend of mine
Hey time you're no friend of mine No friend of mine
Time, you're no friend of mine
No friend of mine
Hey time, you're no friend of mine
Hey time you're no friend of mine The pieces of me I have lost
Without any choice I move on Time
In time your no friend of mine You walked away in silence
You walked away to breathe
Stopped and turned around to say goodbye to me
I'm pleading as you're leaving I'm begging you stay
I'm not the man I used to be, I've changed
I'm not the man I used to be, I've changed
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
If my life is the price, then my life it will cost
Now that I'm picking up the pieces see the pain that I have caused
It's hard to believe in someone you thought was lost
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
Don't you walk away in silence...
In tears you counted reasons
Tears covered you it seemed
Face down screaming "God help me please"
I'm pleading as your leaving; I'm begging you to stay
I'm not the man I used to be, I've changed
I'm not the man I used to be, I've changed
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
If my life is the price, then my life it will cost
It will cost my life
Now that I'm picking up the pieces see the pain that I have caused
It's hard to believe in someone you thought was lost
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
Don't you walk away in silence
Please come back to me
Don't you walk away in silence
I'm not the man I used to be!
Well I pray that tomorrow you'll be home
We can rebuild and forever we can go on
Go on, and go on
We can go on, well I pray that tomorrow you'll be home
Look at horizons and let the light bring you home, bring you home
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
If my life is the price, then my life it will cost
Now that I'm picking up the pieces see the pain that I have caused
It's hard to believe in someone you thought was lost
Don't give up on us, don't give up on love
Don't walk away in silence
Please don't walk away
Don't you walk away in silence
I'm not the man I used to be! Silent teacher hold my hand
And lead me to the promised land
Silent Teacher, please define
This ordinary life won't bring me to find it
Me to find it I want to live with my head in the clouds
I want to stumble when I walk to find light
Can you tell me which way to go?
So I can bury him in all of my mind Silent teacher - promise me Silent teacher - promise me
This ordinary life won't bring me to find it
Me to find it I want to live with my head in the clouds
I want to stumble when I walk to find light
Can you tell me which way to go?
So I can bury him in all of my mind Can we save everyone?
Or do we wait until the damage is done?
Can we save everyone?
Or do we wait until the damage is done? I want to live with my head in the clouds
I want to stumble when I walk to find light
Can you tell me which way to go?
So I can bury him in all of my mind
I want to live with my head in the clouds
I want to stumble when I walk to find light
And can you tell me which way to go?
So I can bury him in all of my mind Can we save everyone?
Or do we wait until the damage is done?
Can we save everyone?
Or do we wait until the damage is done? Oh, I didn't mean to yell
But sometimes I get beside myself
And oh, I didn't mean to rush you
But time keeps pushing so much
Oh, time keeps pushing so much Your eyes stare at me in the dark
And I hope those eyes
Don't steal my freedom
My freedom Oh, If I didn't give it all
When I stood you made me crawl
And oh, if you never heard the song
Then I could still hide down behind the wall
Then I could still hide down behind the wall Your eyes stare at me in the dark
And I hope those eyes
Don't steal my freedom
My freedom And I hope those eyes
Don't steal my freedom
My freedom
Said eyes, fallow me
I still believe there's something left for you me, for you me Your eyes stare at me in the dark
And I hope those eyes
Don't steal my freedom
My freedom
Oh, my freedom Your eyes stare at me in the dark
And I hope those eyes
Don't steal my freedom
My freedom
Oh, my freedom
Said eyes, those eyes
Said eyes, those eyes
I said don't steal my freedom She came calling
One early morning
She showed her crown of thorns
She whispered softly
To tell her story
About how she had been wronged
As she lay lifeless
He stole her innocence
And this is how she carried on
this is how she carried on
Well I guess she closed her eyes
And just imagined everything's alright
But she could not hide her tears
'Cause they were sent to wash away those years
They were sent to wash away those years
My anger's violent
But still I'm silent
When tradegy strikes at home
I know this decadence
Is shared by millions
Remember you're not alone
Remember you're not alone Well if you'll just close your eyes
And just imagine everythings alright
But do not hide your tears
'Cause they were sent to wash away those years
Well if you'll just close your eyes
And just imagine everythings alright
But do not hide your tears
'Cause they were sent to wash away those years
They were sent to wash away those years
Maybe we can wash away those years For we have crossed many oceans
And we've labored in between
In life there are many quotients
An I hope I find the mean Well if you'll just close your eyes
And just imagine everythings alright
But do not hide your tears
'Cause they were sent to wash away those years
Well if you'll just close your eyes
And just imagine everythings alright
But do not hide your tears
'Cause they were sent to wash away those years Maybe we can wash away those years
I hope that you can wash away those years Got your freedom now boy
Who do you serve
Took for granted what you, should have preserved
No time left, no time left, to make amends
Keep burning bridges while you're buying your new friends
A day of reflection hits, you're a shell, skin and bones, counting costs
Is it worth your soul
A day of reflection hits It's funny how times can change, rearrange and distance makes
The pain fade away
So important then, doesn't matter now
Both feet on the ground
Come full circle, yeah, come full circle No access granted now boy, you've been denied
Jump a fence to see what's on the other side
Are you wanted, are you wanted
The question is, could second chances mean another impression
A day of reflection hits, your you're a shell, skin and bones, counting costs
Is it worth your soul
A day of reflection hits It's funny how times can change, rearrange, and distance makes
The pain fade away
So important then, doesn't matter now
Both feet on the ground
Come full circle, we've come full circle I got one foot stuck in heaven, yeah
One boot stuck in hell
I looked at God, he winked at me
I made this mess myself
Don't be surprised and don't deny
Hear every word I say
Close the door and don't look back or you will fade away It's funny how times can change, rearrange and distance makes
The pain fade away It's funny how times can change, rearrange and distance makes
The pain fade away
So important then, doesn't matter now
Both feet on the ground
Come full circle, full circle, come full circle
We have come, full circle The cradle of civilization sparks my fascination
Truth ignites our generation to change what's been programmed
Inside my mind Don't you turn a blind eye
Change what's been programmed inside
Don't you turn a blind eye Listen to me when I tell you
Feel the passion in my breath
Stay on top if they let you
Cause the change is permanent!
Change is permanent Rudiments of interpersonal communication
Truth will uproot and bring war's devastation to light Don't you turn a blind eye
Change what's been programmed inside
Don't you turn a blind eye
Staying silent is a crime Listen to me when I tell you
Feel the passion in my breath
Stay on top if they let you
Cause the change is permanent!
Change is permanent Change starts in your mind
Leave the past behind
Forget everything you know
Make a change... Let go (x2) Letgo... let go... let go Listen to me when I tell you
Feel the passion in my breath
Stay on top if they let you
Cause the change is permanent!
Change is permanent (x2) Don't cry victim to me
Everything we are and used to be is buried and gone
Now it's my turn to speak
It's my turn to expose and release what's been killing me
I'll be damned fighting you
It's impossible, impossible
Say goodbye with no sympathy I'm entitled to overcome
Completely stunned and numb
Knock me down, throw me to the floor
There's no pain; I can't feel no more
I'm entitled to overcome
Overcome Finally see what's beneath
Everything I am and hope to be cannot be lost
I'll be damned fighting you
You're impossible, impossible
Say goodbye with no sympathy I'm entitled to overcome
Completely stunned and numb
Knock me down, throw me to the floor
There's no pain; I can't feel no more
I'm entitled to overcome
Overcome
Overcome You'll never know what I was thinking before you came 'round
Take a step, take a breath, put your guard down
(Overcome)
I cannot worry anymore of what you think of me
I may be crazy but I'm buried in your memory I'm entitled to overcome
Completely stunned and numb
Knock me down, throw me to the floor
There's no pain; I can't feel no more (Look in my eyes)
I'm entitled to overcome
(I'll fight till I die)
Completely stunned and numb
(Look in my eyes)
I'm entitled to overcome
(I'll fight till I die)
Completely stunned and numb
I'm entitled to overcome I may be crazy but I'm buried in your memory Woke up and had a face to face
Guess my reflection had a lot to say
Why let my worries steal my days
It just brings me down Does the song you sing
Have enough meaning
Inspire us to sing along
Does the song you sing
Keep echoing
Inspire us to sing the song you sing What's wrong with the world today
Tell me what's all the talk about

Hear them echoing, hear them echoing Does the song you sing
Have enough meaning
Inspire us to sing along
Does the song you sing keep echoing
Inspire us to sing the song you sing The song you sing the song you sing
It's the song you sing, it's the life you bring It's why I sing the song you sing I give my all my everything
Anything you want I've tried to be
I tried, god knows I tried
Or am I stuck somewhere between
Who I am and who I hope to be
Am I fighting the good fight Keep pressing on
Fight the good fight
Fight, what you know is wrong
Keep pressing on
Fight the good fight
Fight, what you know is wrong I've come so far to fall too fast
As for? I can't look back I try
God knows I try
I shift my eyes to the sky
In the distance see the horizon line
She waits for me
Fighting the good fight Keep pressing on
Fight the good fight
Fight, what you know is wrong
Keep pressing on
Fight the good fight
Fight, what you know is wrong I give my all my everything
Anything you want I strive to be

Fighting the good fight
Am I stuck somewhere in between
Who I am and who I hope to be Keep pressing on
Fight the good fight
Fight, what you know is wrong
Keep pressing on
Fight the good fight
Fight, what you know is wrong Remember that
Sometimes I fall in between
The nights blue moon and the shadows
Fight on, Fight the good fight
What you know is wrong
I'll keep fighting
Fight on, keep fighting the good fight
Fight on, fight on Hang me, watch awhile
Let me see you smile, as I die
Take me, as my body burns
Let me see you yearn, while I cry
One step on your own
And you walk all over me
One head in the clouds
You won't let go
You're too proud
One light to the blind, and they see
One touch on the head, we believe
Adore me as I drift away
Let me hear you say I'm fine
You cry as my body dies
All that you despised is gone away
One step on your own
And you walk all over me
One head in the clouds
You won't let go
You're too proud
One light to the blind, and they see
One touch on the head, we believe Lines form on my face and hands
Lines form from the ups and downs
I'm in the middle without any plans
I'm a boy and I'm a man I'm eighteen and I don't know what I want
Eighteen, I just don't know what I want
Eighteen, I gotta get away
I've gotta get out of this place
I'll go running in outer space
Oh Yeah I've got a baby's brain and an old man's heart
Took eighteen years to get this far
Don't always know what I'm talking about
Feels like I'm living in the middle of doubt
Cause I'm Eighteen, I get confused everyday
Eighteen, I just don't know what to say
Eighteen, I gotta get away Oh, lines form on my face and my hands
Lines form on the left and right
I'm in the middle, the middle of life
I'm a boy and I'm a man I'm eighteen and I LIKE IT
Yes I like it
Oh I like it
Love it
Like it
Love it
Eighteen!
Eighteen!
Eighteen!
Eighteen and I LIKE IT She came calling

I hope that you can wash away those years The rage in my eyes
Could have compared to the eye of the sun
Then rain
Took its course through the hands of the son
Revenge for all time
The world is at war leaving all hope (fault?) behind So, is this the end for us my friend?
So, is this the end for us my friend?
The stains in the sky
Are there to remind us of man and his fight(?)
When two worlds collide
One steals a life like a thief in the night
So look to the sky
He holds the keys for your life
And mine So, is this the end for us my friend?
So, is this the end for us my friend?
So, is this the end for us my friend? Well, as the wind rides (Well as though we rise?)
As the day breaks the dawn
And as the moon hides the sun
Oh the sun
No more sorrow
All those crying days are gone
No more sorrow now its gone
Now it's gone
Now it's gone So, is this the end for us my friend? So, is this the end for us my friend?
So, is this the end for us my friend?
So, is this the end for us my friend?
So, is this the end for us my friend? If you say I'm alive I guess I'm living
Why should I guess your size, a choice I've been given
Tell me everything's fine and peace is coming
I won't listen to the heartache I'm numbing When the world casts me down and says I've changed
I'll survive on all the promises you made to me
Guess there's no one to blame
When all you're living on is bread of shame
Bread of Shame
When the world says I've changed
Bread of shame
Just promise me fame I'll survive on the bread of shame As long as you say I'm free
Then keep these chains off me
Tell me down is up
I'll let you fill this broken cup
When the world fall down
Let them fall on me
Cause no one's around who believe me When the world casts me down and says I've changed
I'll survive on all the promises you made to me
Guess there's no one to blame
When all you're living on is bread of shame
Bread of Shame
When the world says I've changed
Bread of shame
Just promise me fame I'll survive on the bread of shame Tell me where I sign my name
Inside I find no peace of mind to hide behind
Only bread of shame
Tell me where I sign my name
Inside I have no peace of mind
Only bread of shame Bread of Shame
When the world says I've changed
Bread of Shame
Just promise me fame I'll survive on the bread of shame

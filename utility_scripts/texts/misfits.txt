I don't know what to do.
My hands are trembling
I can't spare

KNIFE!
Her beauty is so illogical
the beats come flying in.
Hideous chameleon
just stripped down to her skin.
Dance to the burning flame
dance till you soothe the pain
run backwards into drain.
Dance Helena, Dance!

There's a spot on the floor

I remember halloween Dead cats hanging from poles
Little dead are out in groves
I remember halloween Brown leafed vertigo
Where skeletal life is known
I remember halloween This day anything goes
Burning bodies hanging from poles
I remember halloween Halloween, halloween, halloween, halloween Candy apples and razor blades
Little dead are soon in graves
I remember halloween
This day anything goes
Burning bodies hanging from poles
I remember
Halloween, halloween, halloween, halloween
Halloween, halloween, halloween, halloween There's 52 ways to murder anyone
One and two are the same
And they both work as well
I'm coming clean for Amy
Julie doesn't scream as well
And the cops won't listen all night
And so maybe I'll be over
Just as soon as I fill them all in And I can remember when I saw her last
We were running all around and having a blast, having a blast
But the back seat of the drive-in
Is so lonely without you
I know when your home
I was thinking about you
There was something I forgot to say
I was crying on Saturday night I was out cruising without you
They were playing our song
Crying on Saturday night As the moon becomes the night time
You go viciously, quietly, away
I'm sitting in the bedroom
Where we used to sit and smoke cigarettes
Now I'm watching, watching you die I can remember when I saw her last
We were running all around and having a blast
But the back seat of the drive-in
Is so lonely without you
I know when your home
I was thinking about you
There was something I forgot to say
I was crying on Saturday night I was out cruising without you
They were playing our song
Crying on Saturday night
Crying on Saturday night
Crying on Saturday night Anything is what she is
Anywhere is where she's from
Anything is what she'll be
Anything as long as it's mine And the door it opens is the way back in
Or is it the way back out? Anyplace is where she'll be
Anyplace, she'll see you from
Lies and secrets become your world
Anytime, anywhere she takes me away And death climbs up the steps one by one
To give you the rose that's been burnt by her son Point me to the sky above
I can't get there on my own
Walk me to the graveyard
Dig up her bones I have seen the demon's face
I have heard of her death place
I fall down on my knees in praise of the
Horrible things that took her away And death climbs up the steps one by one
To give you the rose that's been burnt by her son Point me to the sky above
I can't get there on my own
Walk me to the graveyard
Dig up her bones
Point me to the sky above
I can't get there on my own
Walk me to the graveyard
Dig up her bones
Bones President's bullet-ridden body in the street
Ride, Johnny ride
Kennedy's shattered head hits concrete
Ride, Johnny ride Johnny's wife is floundering
Johnny's wife is scared
Run, Jackie run Texas is an outrage when your husband is dead
Texas is an outrage when they pick up his head
Texas is the reason that the president's dead
You gotta suck, suck, Jackie suck President's bullet-ridden body in the street
Ride, Johnny ride

You gotta suck, suck, Jackie suck Arise Jackie O, Jonathon F. Kennedy
Well, arise and be shot down
The dirt's gonna be your dessert
My cum be your life source
And the only way to get it
Is to suck or fuck
Or be poor and devoid
And masturbate me
Masturbate me
Then slurp it from your palm
Like a dry desert soaking up rain
Soaking up sun
Like a dry desert soaking up rain
Soaking up sun She walked out with empty arms
Machine gun in her hand
She is good and she is bad
No one understands She walked in in silence
Never spoke a word
She's got a rich daddy
She's her daddy's girl She loves naked sin
He loves evil sex
She has lost control
They are growing old She will hide in silence
Then her day will come
She was virgin vixen

They fall from the sky
And walk the streets
Among mortal men
They hide in shadows Keepers of the night
Mortal life is weak
Can't hold back the demons
The blood pours as rain
And soon you'll be alone Descending angel
Stand by my side
We'll face the night
Descending angel
Guard the gates of Hell Just one more night
For in the morning
We'll bring the light
Born or created
In the image of a god
The heavens fall No saviour has been sent
No one to guide us
Alone we face the night
Mortal life is brief
For the rebel angels They make their final stand
And soon you'll be alone
Descending angel
Stand by my side
We'll face the night
Descending angel
Guard the gates of Hell
Just one more night
Forever ends tonight
Descending angel
Descending angel
Descending angel
Stand by my side
We'll face the night
Descending angel
Guard the gates of Hell
Just one more night
Forever ends tonight
Descending angel

When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab, began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise He did the mash, he did the monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
He did the mash, it caught on in a flash
He did the mash, he did the monster mash From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom, where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes He did the mash, he did the monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
He did the mash, it caught on in a flash
He did the mash, he did the monster mash The zombies were having fun, the party had just begun
The guests included Wolf Man, Dracula and his son The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive
With their vocal group, "The Crypt-Kicker Five" He did the mash, he did the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
They played the mash, it caught on in a flash
He played the mash, he did the monster mash Out from his coffin, Drac's voice did ring
Seems he was troubled by just one thing
He opened the lid and shook his fist
And said, "Whatever happened to my Transylvania twist?" It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash
The monster mash, and it's a graveyard smash
It's the mash, it's caught on in a flash
It's the mash, it is the monster mash Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band
And my monster mash is the hit of the land
For you, the living, this mash was meant too
When you get to my door, tell them Model A sent you Then you can mash, then you can monster mash
The monster mash, and do a graveyard smash
Then you can mash, you'll catch on in a flash
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash Oh, all I want to know

Of a good man named Ed
Left his son for a moment
Returned, found him dead Recalls a tale as a boy he was told
Of an evil witch, so wicked, so old
Seeks a farmer's advice he will not give
His oldest son knows just where the witch lived He took Ed there but refused to go in
The boy knew what was about to begin
She had the power to avenge the dead
It cost your soul, now come with me Ed I'm gonna take you where your body will lie
I'm gonna take you there, my friend
I'm gonna show you where your life will end
I'm gonna bring you here again Dig up this grave, the old lady said
The thing we need it lies there dormant, sleeping with the dead
You understand what you ask of me
Not even death can set your soul free I cast this curse and you will find
An evil darkness deep inside your vengeful mind
God damn you to hell, he could not restrain
He already has son, the witch did explain I'm gonna take you where your body will lie
I'm gonna take you there, my friend
I'm gonna show you where your life will end
I'm gonna bring you here again Pumpkinhead, Pumpkinhead
I'm gonna take you where your body will lie
I'm gonna take you there, she said
I'm gonna show you where your life will end
This curse I cast, you're Pumpkinhead!
"Keep away from Pumpkinhead unless you're tired of living
His enemies are mostly dead, he's mean and unforgiving." there eyes from many centuries
peered in from space
sincere the hope, their wise believed
they could teach our race
but yet on mars, a darker side
like all things that god made
their tribe of war, would heed them not
"earth they must invade" see: the fire in the skies
see: them devastate the land
mars attacks: the warlord chief commands see: the humans fight and die
see: our planet laid to waste
mars attacks: monsters invade the earth from space it was then, in our darkest hour
when everything seemed lost
the hearts of men would not concede
no matter what the cost they forged a sword of sound and steel
upon the martian doors
the voice of god would thunder there
and "mars would be no more!" see: the martian cities fall
see: the death of the warrior tribe
"mars attacks" now there planet won't survive
see: their world turn to ash
see: the terror on their face
"mars explodes" cast out as rubble into space
mars attacks: monsters invade the earth from space Hey, hey

Up the mountain's south side
It has a cloud that acts in such peculiar ways Accident count rising
A young girl prophesizing
To protect their race, they'll seize her mind At this altitude, it's freezing
Aliens control human beings
No one has lived to tell
Who's seen the crawling eye? At this altitude, it's freezing
Aliens control human beings
No one has lived to tell
Who's seen the crawling eye? These evil demon eyes
Under cloud cover hide
They have great tentacles to tear apart their prey All these men are dying
Crawling eye decapitizing
Fiends without a face attack mankind At this altitude, it's freezing
Aliens control human beings
No one has lived to tell
Who's seen the crawling eye? At this altitude, it's freezing
Aliens control human beings
No one has lived to tell
Who's seen the crawling eye, eye? [Originally performed by Jerry Lee Lewis] You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain 
Too much love drives a man insane

Come on baby, drive me crazy 
Goodness gracious great balls of fire This street we walk upon
This corner full of piss and fear
This street won't bear it long
It slants, it tilts, it's brought outside Alive Cover your face when you walk by
Drench your visions in darkness
Spit up blood when you cough
Cool, cool, cool Cough, cool, cool, cool We dine on visions with new eyes
Creep, creep, creep, creep We cut our visions with two eyes

Of darkness few have known
A monster lusting blood and
The hunger grows
Out on the street, dangers real
The killers still at large
A trail of death through the sewers
To the underground I feel their fleeting life
Draw into my bones
Hear the heart that pounds, the blood that flows
Eternity i damn thee
Let me rot into the ground
As the empty veins collapse...
Cast them down... Living Hell, Living Hell, Living Hell
I just can't go on...
In this Living Hell This town has worn thin
Everybody knows
Panic in the news
And the terror grows
A tunnel full of filth
Escape into the night
Another hole to dwell in
The Underground I feel their fleeting life
Draw into my bones
Hear the heart that pounds
The blood that flows
Eternity I damn thee
Let thee rot into the ground
As the empty veins collapse...
Cast them down... Living Hell, Living, Living Hell
I just cant go on...
In this Living Hell First thing's first.

Along the maddening march of death
With the furor and the masses
Whose supremacies is the dominion
Alien bodies stiff and cold
Your inner sane turns numb
You transform into a rage
Too naive to understand And as they go on the sacrifice grows
We're living on ground zero, fire
This island earth
Target locked, systems checked, enter code
We're living on ground zero, fire
(fire, this island earth) Locked up in a room
Human beings in a cage
The sentence a scienced death
As they pull the triggers of ray guns
Evil blackened eyes of youth
Absorbing life's hidden anguish
Death thrown all about the ground
Or those who wouldn't fight And as they go on the sacrifice grows

We're stripped of all we were
In the eyes of tiger We are 138, We are 138, We are 138
We are 138, We are 138, We are 138
8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8 Buried beneath the statue, the answer hides
Enduring throughout the ages
The transmitter lies
Once the chambers open the signal will be sent
To another world... far beyond the stars Don't open 'til doomsday
Destruction's not far away
Don't open 'til doomsday
You might not like what you find Don't open 'til doomsday
Destruction's not far away
Don't open 'til doomsday
You might not like what you find inside We were warned of this coming so long ago
Immortal secrets... man shouldn't know
Entering a realm where we just don't belong
We called them and they're coming Don't open 'til doomsday
Destruction's not far away
Don't open 'til doomsday
You might not like what you find inside Don't open 'til doomsday
(inside) destruction's not far away
(inside) don't open 'til doomsday
You might not like what you find
You might not like what you find inside So make this demon offering

I see you standing in the alleys and the hallways
Wait a second, you're gone now
I run to touch you but you vanish through the doorway
And oh, how hard it is to live without you I love everything about you
Now I know you're really gone
But my imagination is so strong
That I see you coming into view And your face is telling me that you
Oh yeah oh, want to be by my side
Oh yeah oh, now it's finally time
Wait a second Mirage, that's all you are to me
Mirage, something I only see So I keep walking through the alleys
And the hallways where are you
I keep remembering the kissing
In the doorways, the car too
How it all comes back to me The movies every Saturday
The place we used to go to eat
I want so much to have it like it used to be
That I see you coming into view And your face is telling me that you
Oh yeah oh, want to be by my side
Oh yeah oh, now it's finally time
Here it comes again Mirage, that's all you are to me
Mirage, something I only see Just a mirage, that's all you are to me
Just a mirage, something that I only see Just a mirage, that's all you are to me
Just a mirage, something that I only see Come on everyone we gotta get together now
Oh yeah, love's the only thing that matters anyhow
And the beauty of life can only survive
If we love one another
Oh yeah yesterday my friends were marching out to war
Oh yeah listen now we ain't a marching anymore
No we ain't gonna fight
Only God has the right
To decide who's to live and die
He gave us sweet cherry wine
So very fine
Drink it right down, pass it all around
So stimulating, so intoxicating
Sweet cherry wine
To open your mind
And everybody's gonna feel so fine
Drinking sweet cherry wine
Yes they will Watch the mountain turn
To dust and glow away
Oh Lord, you know there's got to be a better way
And the old masquerade is a no soul parade
Marchin' through the ruins of time
To save us He gave us sweet cherry wine Sweet cherry wine, so very fine
Drink it right down
Pass it all around
So stimulating, so intoxicating
Sweet cherry wine
Drink it with your brother
Trust in one another, yeah, yeah
He gave us sweet cherry wine
Sweet cherry wine
Drink it right down
Pass it all around
People don't you know the cup is running over
Sweet cherry wine I see you standing in the alleys and the hallways
Wait a second, you're gone now
I run to touch you but you vanish through the doorway
And oh, how hard it is to live without you I love everything about you
Now I know you're really gone

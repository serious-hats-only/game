In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey
Butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flamin' with a loser and the cruise control
Babies in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the loveseat
Someone came in sayin' I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Savin' all your food stamps and burnin' down the trailer park
Yo, cut it Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Double-barrel buckshot)
Soy un perdedor I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me? Forces of evil in a bozo nightmare

With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose-job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey-neck and it's hangin' from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can't relate

(Know what I'm sayin'?) Full moon sways
Gently in the night of one fine day
On my way
Looking for a moment with my dear Full moon waves
Slowly on the surface of the lake
You are there
Smiling in my arms for all those years What a fool!
I don't know about tomorrow
What it's like to be
Ah~ I was sure
'Couldn't let myself to go
Even though I feel
The end Oh my fair...
Floating like a bird that's in her wings
You are there
Smiling in my arms for all those years What a fool!
I don't know about tomorrow
What it's like to be
Ah~ I was sure
'Couldn't let myself to go
Even though I feel
The end Full moon sways
Gently in the night of one fine day
You are there
Smiling in my arms for all those years Can't you hear those cavalry drums?
Hijacking your equilibrium
Midnight snacks in the mausoleum
Where the pixilated doctors moan Carnivores in the Kowloon night
Breathing freon by the candlelight
Coquettes bitch slap you so polite
Till you thank them for the tea and sympathy I want to defy the logic of all sexxlaws
Let the handcuffs slip off your wrists
I'll let you be my chaperoned at the halfway home
I'm a full grown man but I'm not afraid to cry Neptune's lips taste like fermented wine
Perfumed blokes on the Ginza line
Running buck wild like a concubine
Who's mother never held her hand Brief encounters in Mercedes Benz
Wearing hepatitis contact lens
Bed and breakfast getaway weekends
With Sports Illustrated moms I want to defy the logic of all sexxlaws
Let the handcuffs slip off your wrists
I'll let you be my chaperoned at the halfway home
I'm a full grown man but I'm not afraid to cry Change your heart
Look around you Change your heart
It will astound you I need your loving
Like the sunshine And everybody's gotta learn sometime
Everybody's gotta learn sometime Everybody's gotta learn sometime
Change your heart
Look around you
Change your heart
It will astound you
I need your loving
Like the sunshine
And everybody's gotta learn sometime
Everybody's gotta learn sometime
Everybody's gotta learn sometime
I need your loving
Like the sunshine
Everybody's gotta learn sometime
Everybody's gotta learn sometime
Everybody's gotta learn sometime
Everybody's gotta learn sometime
Everybody's gotta learn sometime
Everybody's gotta learn sometime I don't know since when I changed to such a cold-hearted guy
I have to warm this frozen, icy, lonely heart to thaw
I like being wrapped with warmness more than anything else for sure
I'm gonna make my coming days to be filled with laughter and joy I let myself down that I'm more cruel than I thought I would be
I'm just a loser who ends up by caring for my soul
I don't give my heart to no one cause I don't wanna waste my time
I tried to love this loneliness to slip out of this lonesome hole Sorrow is what I hate but it's grown my sensations
Regrets taught me how to make any hard decisions
Peace is always by my side but I've never felt it once
Love is not the word only for the sweet romance Well, I'm scared, scared, scared, scared to death
And I'm scared to keep on going on my way
Well, I'm scared, scared, scared, scared to death
And I'll tell myself I'm special till the end Recalling my torn, broken, aching heart of these long days
And all the memories I wanted to forget for making leaps
Recalling, breaking, aching, crying, making sure to me
And I take all and grin at my future on the way Sorrow is what I hate but it's grown my sensations
Regrets taught me how to make any hard decisions
Peace is always by my side but I've never felt it once
Love is not the word only for the sweet romance Well, I'm scared, scared, scared, scared to death
And I'm scared to keep on going on my way
Well, I'm scared, scared, scared, scared to death
And I'll tell myself I'm special till the end I don't give my heart to no one cause I don't wanna waste my time I tried to love this loneliness to slip out of this lonesome hole Here we go, 1 2 3 4 There's nothing left to hide
You can see it in my eyes
Oh I've tried to be who I thought you wanted And if it's all a lie
The truth's not far behind
We could try to live right for the moment Ramona
Ramona
Ramona If only I had known,
It's less than what I felt
Why should I have nothing to fear from? Ramona
Ramona
Ramona Ramona
Ramona
Ramona
Ramona
Ramona
Ramona Large lips in the motion
Trying to keep blaming on

Find you turning
Laughing and smiling Running over sometimes
Feel like you leave me behind

Find you shining
Everyday by day Sing it up, my sister
In this world which everyone is lonely
Everything will be fine someday Remember

Hiding myself in garage
Since you never could catch me
Find you crying
Weeping in darkness Sing it up, my sister

Everything will be fine someday
Some other day Large lips in the motion
Trying to keep blaming on

And I always set you free from all those yesteryears
But you don't know how much

In such a coldest summer breeze
Meanwhile I wonder why we're here
Look for the line between love and friends
We'll be twisting ourselves again I was standing at the corner on the street

Waiting to back up on my feet
Reading a line between night and day
I'll be twisting myself again Oh yeah, come on I met you at J C Penny

I'm not afraid to, to I saw her, yea I saw her
With a black tongue tied round the roses
A fist pounding on a vending machine
Toy diamond ring stuck on her finger
With a noose she could hang from the sun
And point it out with the dark sunglasses
Walking crooked down the beach
She spits in the sand
Where their bones are bleaching And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
She doesn't even know it's wrong
And you know I'm gonna make her die
Take her where her soul belongs
Know I'm gonna steal her eye
Nothing that I wouldn't try Hey my sun-eyed girl
Hey my sun-eyed girl
My sun-eyed girl
Hey my sun-eyed girl I saw her, yea I saw her With her hands tied back
Her rags are burnin'
Calling out from a landfilled life
Scrawling her name up on the ceiling
Throw a coin in the fountain of dust
White noise, her ears are ringing
Got a ticket for my midnight hanging
Throw a bullet from a freight train leaving And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
She doesn't even know it's wrong
And you know I'm gonna make her die
Take her where her soul belongs
Know I'm gonna steal her eye
Nothing that I wouldn't try Hey my sun-eyed girl

Round the roses
Fist pounding on a vending machine
Toy diamond ring stuck on her finger With a noose she can hang from the sun
And put it out with her dark sunglasses
Walking crooked down the beach
She spits on the sand where their bones are bleaching And I know I'm gonna steal her life
She doesn't even know what's wrong
And I know I'm gonna make her die
Take her where her soul belongs And I know I'm gonna steal her life
Nothing that I wouldn't try Hey, my cyanide girl

White noise, her ears are ringing
Got a ticket for my midnight hanging
Throw a bullet from a freight train leaving And I know I'm gonna steal her life

Hey, my cyanide girl When you get the rhythm and words all make you cold
When you break it down and this world is all you know
Hands up, you're waving it around
Now get yourself together
When you count the dominos fall, it's time to go Now I'm feeling so far away
I see the colors and all the kids going home
Night is crawling into the day
I hear my voice ringing
The summertime's singing 
Just want to stay up all night with you
Just want to stay up all night with you
There's nothing that I wouldn't rather do
Just want to stay up all night with you I'll keep it moving
Don't wait for nothing now
I gotta keep it moving
Don't wait for nothing now
I'll keep it moving
Don't wait for nothing now
I gotta keep it moving
Don't wait for nothing now 
1,2, what you doing?
I've been jumping through some hoops
Want to get my body loose
Want to tell you, tell you what to do
I've been running on the grass like an animal struggling
Looking for a diamond
I'm trying, I'm fighting
Back into the rhythm now 
I just want to stay up
I just want to stay up all night with you
With you, with you 
Just want to stay up all night with you
Just want to stay up all night with you
There's nothing that I wouldn't rather do
Just want to stay up all night with you Hands up in the air
If you don't really care
Living on [?] there
If you got the climb to take it up there Hands up in the air
Living out on a prayer
Never know that you're there
Nothing that I want but rather be there Giddy up, giddy it up
Giddy up, giddy up Wanna move into a fool's gold room
With my pulse on the animal jewels
Of the rules that you choose to use to get loose
With the luminous moves
Bored of these limits, let me get, let me get it like Wow!

Falling like a hot knife
Call your wife; secular times, these times
My demon's on the cell phone
To your demons, nothing's even right or wrong
It's irrelevant, elephant in the room goes boom
Standing on a line doin' jiu jitsu
Girl in the bikini with the Lamborghini shih tzu It's your life
You gotta try to get it right
Look around, don't forget where you came from
It's just another perfect night
We're gonna take it around the world
We're gonna take it around the world
When this one is over
I lose my emotions
We're gonna take it around the world Like
Wow, wow, wow
Like
Giddy up!
Giddy up!
Wow! Come on out of your dreams
And wake up from your reverie
Time is here, don't go to sleep
Streets are running on the brink
They say that we've got nothing
But a dollar for a life of sin
Cause there's trouble on the way
Oh, there's trouble on the way
Oh, get a dog and pony for a judgment day Here we are
Running circles, around around around around
When nothing's right, just close your eyes
Close your eyes and you're gone Dreams (dreams dreams)

She's makin' me high, she's makin' me high
Dreams (dreams dreams)

Nothing gonna get me in my world
Nothing gonna get me in my world There's a destination a little up the road
From the habitations and the towns we know
A place we saw the lights turn low
The jigsaw jazz and the get-fresh flow
Pulling out jives and jamboree handouts
Two turntables and a microphone
Bottles and cans and just clap your hands
And just clap your hands Where it's at
I got two turntables and a microphone
Where it's at
I got two turntables and a microphone
Where it's at
I got two turntables and a microphone
Where it's at
I got two turntables and a microphone Take me home with my elevator bones
That was a good drum break Pick yourself up off the side of the road
With your elevator bones and your whip-flash tones
Members only hypnotizers
Move through the room like ambulance drivers
Shine your shoes with your microphone blues
Hirsutes with your parachute fruits
Passing the dutchie from coast to coast
Like my man Gary Wilson, I rock the most Where it's at
I got two turntables and a microphone
Where it's at
I got two turntables and a microphone What about those who swing both ways? AC-DC's?
Let's make it out baby Two turntables and a microphone
Two turntables and a microphone
Two turntables and a microphone
Two turntables and a microphone
Two turntables and a microphone
Two turntables and a microphone We're all part of the total syndrome Where it's at
I got two turntables and a microphone
Where it's at
I got two turntables and a microphone Oh, dear me, make-out city's a two-horse town
That's beautiful, Dad Got my microphone
There's a destination a little up the road
From the habitations and the towns we know
A place we saw the lights turn low
The jig-saw jazz and the get-fresh flow
Pulling out jives and jamboree handouts
Two turntables and a microphone
Bottles and cans and just clap your hands
And just clap your hands Where it's at
I got two turntables and a microphone
Where it's at
I got two turntables and a microphone I got plastic on my mind
Make it out, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's make it out, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Telephone plastic baby
Ahh, so good
Oh, yeah
Let's play good I'll find you, go right through walls we made
I see you, I need you every day
It's nothing, it's your life
I don't know why, can't get what I want
I keep, I keep trying
Found our way through the lost years
Now the day brings it all here All the colors, see the colors, make the colors
Feel the colors, she says: See it in your eyes
All the colors, see the colors, make the colors
Feel the colors
Tell me, do you feel alive? All the colors, see the colors, make the colors
Feel the colors, she says: Nothing's in your eyes
All the colors, see the colors, make the colors
Feel the colors
Tell me, do you feel the life? Do you feel the life?
Do you feel the life? I've got all the love you need
I've got all the love you need
Keep it with you
I don't have the time to wait
I don't have the time to way
I need to see you
Got it all under control
Got it all under control
You can't hear me
Now it only hurts to know
Now it would only hurt to know
When you don't need me
You don't need me Found our way through the lost years
Now the day brings it all here All the colors, see the colors, make the colors
Feel the colors, she says: See it in your eyes
All the colors, see the colors, make the colors
Feel the colors
Tell me, do you feel the life?
Feel the life
Do you feel the life? All the colors, see the colors, make the colors
Feel the colors, she says: See it in your eyes

Feel the colors
Tell me, do you feel the life? All the colors, see the colors, make the colors
Feel the colors, she says: Nothing's in your eyes
All the colors, see the colors, make the colors
Feel the colors
Tell me, do you feel the life? I'm so tired of being alone
These penitent walls are all I've known
Songbird calling across the water
Inside my silent asylum Oh don't leave me on my own
Left me standing all alone Cut me down to size so I can fit inside
Lies that will divide us both in time See the turncoat on his knees
A vagabond that no one sees
When a moon is throwing shadows
You can't save the ones you've caught in battle Oh don't leave me on my own
Left me standing all alone Cut me down to size so I can fit inside
Lies you try to hide behind your eyes Don't leave me on my own
Don't leave me on my own
So cut me down to size so I can fit inside
Lies that will divide us both in time Your sorry eyes, they cut through bone.
They make it hard to leave you alone.
Leave you here wearing your wounds
Waving your guns at somebody new. Baby you're lost
Baby you're lost
Baby you're a lost cause. There's too many people you used to know
They see you coming, they see you go.
They know your secrets, and you know theirs
This town is crazy, but nobody cares. Baby you're lost
Baby you're lost
Baby you're a lost cause. I'm tired of fightin'
I'm tired of fightin'
Fighting for a lost cause There's a place where you are going
You ain't never been before
There's no one laughing at your back now
No one standing at your door
Is that what you thought love was for? Baby you're lost
Baby you're lost
Baby you're a lost cause I'm tired of fighting
I'm tired of fighting
Fighting for a lost cause. In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey
Butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flamin' with a loser and the cruise control
Babies in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the loveseat
Someone came in sayin' I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Savin' all your food stamps and burnin' down the trailer park
Yo, cut it Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Double-barrel buckshot)
Soy un perdedor I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me? Forces of evil in a bozo nightmare
Ban all the music with a phoney gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose-job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey-neck and it's hangin' from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate And my time is a piece of wax fallin' on a termite
That's chokin' on the splinters Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Get crazy with the cheeze whiz)
Soy un perdedor I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Drive-by body-pierce) Yo, bring it on down Soy
(backwards) (I'm a driver, I'm a winner)

(Know what I'm sayin'?) Woke up this morning, found a love light in the storm
Looked up this morning, saw the roses full of thorns
Guns are falling, they don't have nowhere to go
Oceans of diamonds always shine, smooth out below Can we start it all over again this morning?
I lost all my defenses this morning
Won't you show me the way it used to be? I've gone all around 'til there's nothing left to say
Wrote it all down into something that couldn't be said
I tore it all down, it buried me underneath the wave Can we start it all over again this morning?
I let down my defenses this morning
It was just you and me this morning
I found all my guesses this morning
Won't you show me the way it could've been? See the sleep that rests upon
The quiet street we're standing on
Is it time to go away?
Try again some other day? These are the words we use to say goodbye
These are the words you use to say goodbye Bones crack, curtains drawn
On my back and the sheet is gone
Somewhere else I do not know
Time will tell and I will go These are the words we use to say goodbye
These are the words we use to say goodbye I will wait, take a turn
Sort it out, let it burn
Empty out empty drawer
In my pockets there's nothing more These are the words you use to say goodbye
These are the words we use to say goodbye You sang your swan song to the dogs
'Cause they made mincemeat of the dreams you hung your hopes on
So you cut it out, well your sins cost
While money talks to your conscience, looking like a fool for love Dear life, I'm holding on
Dear life, I'm holding on, ah ah ah
How long must I wait
Before the thrill is gone? ah ah ah You drove your rolls into the swamp
You stole away like a thief, reeling from the sticker shock
Of the price they put upon your soul
You buy it back from the burning ashes of the devil you know Dear life, I'm holding on
Dear life, I'm holding on, ah ah ah
How long must I wait
Before the thrill is gone? ah ah ah Dear life, come and pick me up
Dear life, I think the button's stuck
Dear life, I think it's gone too far
Dear life, please lower the bar
Lower than the stars Dear life, I'm holding on
Dear life, I'm holding on, ah ah ah
How long must I wait
Before the thrill is gone? ah ah ah Lalalalala, lalala
Lalalala
Lalalalala, lalala
Lalalala You open up the door with negative aura
You say the future is murky indeed.
I'm sick of hearing your gripe Open up the door with negative aura
If you never change
I think There is no way my life fizzle out You open up the door with negative aura
(i'm fed up fed up fed up)
You say the future is murky indeed.
I'm sick of hearing your gripe Open up the door with negative aura
There is no way my life fizzle out If you are at a loss as to what to do.
Raise you stiff middle finger.
It will know which way the wind blows. Don't chain your affection
Awaken primal feeling

Sing out primal scream
Let loose every feeling from joy to grief Don't chain your affection

Game is in your hands.
How do you play?
Follow your brainstorm! There's a blue bird at my window
I can't hear the songs he sings
All the jewels in Heaven
They don't look the same to me
I just wade the tides that turned
Till I learn to leave the past behind
It's only lies that I'm living
It's only tears that I'm crying
It's only you that I'm losing
Guess I'm doing fine
All the battlements are empty
And the moon is laying low
Yellow roses in the graveyard
Got no time to watch them grow
Now I bade a friend farewell
I can do whatever pleases me
It's only lies that I'm living
It's only tears that I'm crying
It's only you that I'm losing
Guess I'm doing fine
Press my face up to the window
To see how warm it is inside
See the things that I've been missin'
Missin' all this time
It's only lies that I'm living
It's only tears that I'm crying
It's only you that I'm losing
Guess I'm doing fine
Guess I'm doing fine (insert various variations of lead-in b.s., for example:
"i was walking down glendale blvd. one night. someone

We'll keep it on the down-low
No use in wastin no time
Tryin to get to know each other
Ow ow ow ow, etc. It's not the words I want to tell you
It's not the tension that I feel
It's not the face that I'm showing you today
That betrays the way, the way I want to feel What I need
What I need
What I need right now is right here
Right in front of me What I need
What I need
What I need right now is right here
Right in front of me A million times, a million thoughts
I really don't know what I want
But then I see you, now I'm almost lost
And everything that I know went wrong
And if it means that it's done and I'm a fool
But I don't want to forget what we've been through
Just to save us both from what we knew
Losing our way, sometimes it's cruel No distraction
No distraction
Can I, can I be with you?
No distraction
No distraction
Can I, can I be with you? Pull you to the left
Pull you the right
Pull you in all directions
Pull you to the left
Pull you the right
Pull you in all directions It's not the objects that I hold in my possession
It's not the worldly things that shine
Sometimes the worst will come and bring us back together
Well, hold me up and get me through the night What I need
What I need
What I need right now
Is all right, right in front of me? What I need
What I need
What I need right now
Is you - you, only you and me A million times, a million thoughts
And I really don't know what I want
But then I see you, then I'm almost lost
In everything that I know went wrong
And if it means that it's done and I'm a fool
When I want to forget what we've been through
Just to save us both from what we knew
Losing our way, sometimes it's cruel No distraction

Pull you in all directions I'm losing time
I'm losing time
There's so many ways
To live or love or die
I'm losing time
I'm losing time
I've wanted to know
Are you still on the line?
Wasting time trying to prove things
Instead of proving my love
I'm losing, I'm losing my mind A million times, a million thoughts
And now I really know what I want
But then I see you, I'm almost lost
In everything that I know went wrong
If it means that it's done and I'm a fool
Don't want to forget what we've been through
Just to save us both from what we knew
Losing our way, sometimes it's cruel No distraction

Can I, can I be with you? Pull you to the left
Pull you the right
Push you in all directions
Pull you to the left
Pull you the right
Push you in all directions Alcohol on my hands, I got plans to ditch myself and get outside
Dancing women throwing plates, decapitating their laughing dates
Swirling chickens caught in flight, out of focus and much too bright
Coming down, shiny teeth, game show suckers trying to breathe But I got a drug and I got the bug
And I got something better than love
How you like me now? Pretty good
Going on, feeling strong I quit my job blowing leaves, telephone bills up my sleeves
Choking like a one man dustball, freedom rock slimeball talking in code
We went down, lit up the shack, grabbed me a beer out of the sack
Everybody bent over twice, painting the walls, throwing some dice Leaping up into the air getting juiced up beyond belief
And they were singin' like this Winos throwing frisbees at the sun
Burnt my soul between the bun
Now I'm wounded, now I'm drunk
Now I'm runnin' like a flaming pig
Oh yeah Scraping off the attitude
Old man eating all my food
Don't be kind, don't be rude
Just shake your boots and let it all get loose
Oh yeah, my goodness Fluffy clouds, lovely rainbows
I'm sad, a soft and snuggly place
Fluffy clouds, I'm sad and unhappy... yppahnu dna das Winos throwing frisbees at the sun
Burnt my soul between the bun
Now I'm wounded, now I'm drunk
Now I'm runnin' like a flaming pig
Oh yeah Scraping off the attitude
Old man eating all my food
Don't be kind, don't be rude
Just shake your boots and let it all get loose
Oh yeah, my goodness Oh yeah, I like it like that
Oh that is cold
Somebody put a flamethrower on that
Uh-huh, oh my goodness
Take me down to the depot
Somebody put me down on the bus
Oh yeah, I like it like that
Somebody burn me a plate of sassafrass
Oh yeah... See me comin' to town with my soul
Straight down out of the world with my fingers
Holdin' onto the devil I know
All my troubles'll hang on your trigger Take your eyes and your mind from the road
Shoot your mouth if you know where you're aimin'
Don't forget to pick up what you sow
Talking trash to the garbage around you Na na, na na na na na
Na na, na na na na na
Na na, na na na na na
Na na, na na na na na See me kickin' the door with my boots
Broke down out in a ditch of old rubbish
Snakes and bones in the back of your room
Handin' out a confection of venom Heaven's drunk from the poison you use
Charm the wolves with the eyes of a gambler
Now I see it's a comfort to you
Hammer my bones on the anvil of daylight Na na, na na na na na

Cabos sueltos enlazan a mi cabeza
Si pensabas ir a lugar
Donde los paganos van
Pongalo junto
Invitación extraño Despierto alguien arrastra mis huesos
Nosotros ascendemos en la tarde
Y recuerdo tu sonrisa
Con el viento salvaje
Hay algo vacio cuando empieza Viajo sin rumbo fijo en mis botas viejas
Cabos sueltos enlazan a mi cabeza Si pensabas ir a lugar
Donde los paganos van
Pongalo junto
Invitación extraño I'm coming over
See me down at the station
By the lane
With my hands in my pocket
Jingling a wish coin
That I stole from a fountain
That was drownin'
All the cares in the world
When I get older
Climbing up on the back porch fence
Just to see the dogs runnin'
With a ring and a question
And my shivering voice is singing
Through a crack in the window
Na na na na na, I better go it alone
Na na na na na, I better go it alone
Na na na na na Down on the corner
See me standing
In a makeshift home
With a dust storm comin'
In a long black shadow
Pull a hammer from a coal mine
Down where your daddy was workin'
Comb my hair back
Strike a match on the bathroom wall
Where my number was written
Driving on the sidewalk
Lookin' back at the sky
It's burning in the rearview mirror
Na na na na na, I better go it alone
Na na na na na, I better go it alone Na na na na na Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na I'm coming over
See you down at the station
By the lane
With my hands in my pocket
Jingling a wish coin
That I stole from a fountain
That was drownin'
All the cares in the world
When I get older
Climbing up on the back fence
Pointing to the dogs standin' firm
With a ring and a question
And my?
In a voice that was singing
Underneath the window Na na na na na, I better go it alone
Na na na na na, I better go it alone

fin You might fix me
You might crush me
Take a little piece of me Start a new history
And trace it back to me
Someday you might see That I want you
I want you
I want you
Oh I want you I don't mind
If the sea washes over the city tonight
Tonight The ground is hollow
The dark skies follow
And you don't know where you've gone Branches on the trees have arms
The moon is a false alarm
Nothing's gonna do you harm
Except yourself I want you
I want you
I want you
Yea I want you I don't mind
If the sea washes over the city tonight
Tonight I'm set free
I'm set free Ahh, suck a headphone! We got a time bomb

Bum bum, bum bum bum, ba-da-da-da bum bum bum Free as a driving wheel
Circling around your iron will
See only what you feel
Keeps you turning when you're standing still
You tried to run from trouble when it comes
You followed the drum keeping time with everyone High as the light of day
You're falling down across your lost highway
Pain - does it hurt this way?
To come so far to find they've closed the gates?
You've lost your tongue when you fall from the pendulum
Your heart is a drum keeping time with everyone Everyone, if they drown from the undertow
Need to find someone to show me how to play it slow
And just let it go Your eyes get stung by the rays of the sinking sun
You follow the drum keeping time with everyone
Going beat beat beat, it's beating me down
Beat beat beat beat, it's beating me down
Day after day, it's turning around
'Til all my days are drowning out Your brains went black
when she took back her love
and she put it out into the sun,
The birds did fly
when the heavens all went dry,
and the cigarettes were smoking by themselves. She'll do anything
She'll do anything
She'll do anything
to make you feel like an asshole. Call her name,
she looks the same as you,
question marks stretched across her skin,
She dangles carrots,
makes you feel embarrassed
to be the fool you know you are. She'll do anything
She'll do anything
She'll do anything
to make you feel like an asshole. Looking for my place on assembly lines
Fake prizes rising out of the bomb holes
Skeleton boys hyped up on purple
Smoke rings blow from across the disco
Bank notes burn like broken equipment
Looking for shelter, readjust your position
Thought control, ghostwritten confessions
Two dimensions, dumb your head down
Duck, don't look now, company missiles
Power is raunchy, rent-a-cops are watching
Make your dreams out of paper mache
Cliched wasted hate taste-tested
Hell yes now I'm moving this way, I'm doing this thing
Please enjoy.
Hell yes now I'm turning it on, I'm working my legs
Hell yes now I'm calling you out, I'm switching my plates
Peace and joy
Hell yes now I'm cleaning the floor, my beat is correct Stretched to the limit, attention spans snap back
Retract, collapsin' the laugh tracks
Noise response, applause and handclaps
Floodgates open to the sound of the rainbow
Breakin' points on the verge of pointless
Fools anointed to the follower's fanfare
Look for the common, not superficial
Code red Cola War conformity crisis
Perfunctory idols rewriting their bibles
With magic markers running out of their ink
Lives in White Out, turn the lights out
Fax machine anthems, get your damned hands up
Hell yes now I'm moving this way, I'm doing this thing
Please enjoy.
Hell yes. now I'm turning it on, I'm working my legs
Hell yes. now I'm calling you out, I'm switching my plates
Peace and joy.
Hell yes. now I'm cleaning the floor, my beat is correct. Yes (Hai) Umisei(?)
Yeah, That's it. (repeated)
Umisei sumisei(?)
Yes.
I like your bass.
Yes.
Your beat is nice.
Yes.
Hell yes.
Hai.
Hell Yes.
Hell Yes. (gasp)
Hell Yes.
Yes.
Hai. *hidden track on Mutations* Looking back at some dead world that looks so new,
Offices and fountains that they named for you,
Dazzlements of accidents rejoice their doom,
Hari-karis spinning round the golden looms. Girl you dream infectious from a nauseous heart,
Choice cut meats from derelict boulevards. Hear that lonesome whistle blow,
No direction to be known,
In a senile revelry. A tearful gaze turns away,
Emoting cold and grey,
scentec eunuchs clothe our wretchedness. Looking back at some dead world that looks so new,
Offices and fountains that they named for you,
So ungrateful to the who's and what's-his-face,
Terrorist confections look so out of place. Looking back at some dead world that looks so new...(5x) She's got a cigarette on each arm
She's got the lily-white cavity crazes
She's got a carborator tied to the moon
Pink gods looking to the fruit of the ages
She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution
She's got a hand on a wheel of pain
She can talk to the mangling strangers
She can sleep in a fiery barn
Throwing troubles to the dying embers
She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution
She's got a paradise camoflauge
Like a whip-crack sending me shivers
She's a boat through a strip-mine ocean
Riding low on the drunken rivers
She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution Something's wrong 'cause my mind is fading,
And everywhere I look there's a dead end waiting.
Temperature's dropping at the rotten oasis.
Stealing kisses from the leperous faces.
Heads are hanging from the garbage man trees.
Mouthwash, jukebox, gasoline.
Pistols are pointing at a poor man's pockets,
Smiling eyes ripping out of his sockets. Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind Love machines on the sympathy crutches,
Discount orgies on the dropout buses.
Hitching a ride with the bleeding noses,
Coming to town with the briefcase blues. Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind Something's wrong 'cause my mind is fading,
Ghetto-blasting disintegrating.
Rock 'n' roll, know what I'm saying?
And everywhere I look, there's a devil waiting. Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Devil's haircut! In my mind!
Devil's haircut! In my mind!
Devil's haircut! In my mind! If I ever think about you
If I ever call your name
And put my empty arms around you
Let the memory die away Looking out for a sign
How can I tell what's right
Changing my ways despite myself
Cause I still want you If I ran across your picture
If I called you by mistake
And if I ask someone about you
It's a habit I can't break Looking out for a sign
How can I tell what's right
Changing my ways despite myself
Cause I still want you I'll be your chauffeur on a midnight drive
It takes a miracle just to survive
Your favourite animals call your name
You keep on sleeping
Through the poignant rain I think we're going crazy
Her left eye is lazy
She looks so Israeli
Nicotine and gravy I'll feed you fruit that don't exist
I'll leave graffiti
Where you've never been kissed
I'll do your laundry
Massage your soul
I'll turn you over
To the highway patrol I think we're going crazy
Things don't even faze me
Her left eye is lazy
Nicotine and gravy
Miracles amaze me
She looks so Israeli
Love the way she plays me
I think I'm going crazy I don't want to die tonight
I don't want to die tonight (voice of Woody Guthrie: I been robbed for cash and I been robbed on credit;
woke up a lot of mornings, didn't even know where I was at. The hardest
work I ever done is when I was trying to get myself a worried woman to ease
my worried mind.) All the things they said would happen to you
don't ya know they're all comin true
goin nowhere fast. nothing's strange as when it seems
you're living out all your worst possible dreams
goin nowhere fast bad times, worse times,
all the times in between
I tangle in the shadow, stumble in the trees
goin nowhere fast I learn my lesson
and I learn it again
I heard what they said, "live fast and die stupid"
goin nowhere fast
my compass is spinnin
like a gamblin wheel
it takes a hideous misfortune for to tell how I feel
goin nowhere fast I threw it all away
like shoes into the street
these terrible things will tear me in three
goin nowhere fast I don't care what time will tell
just tell me if I might as well be halfway to hell
goin nowhere fast I'm sick through my skin
with silence and doom
I break my back, I cry on the moon
goin nowhere fast
going nowhere fast On a highway, unpaved, going my way
You're so alone today
Like a ghost town, I've found
There's no belief, no salt in the sea
Is it true what they say? You can't behave
You gamble your soul away
Measuring the dreams, of this life seems
Like the gristle of loneliness Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
Don't let the sun catch you cryin' Like an ice age, nice days, are on your way
Sipping the golden drinks
On a rip-tide, freak's ride
Asleep inside, a parasite's appetite
Oh, say can't you see? The chemistry
The parasites, the clean up fee
Death never hands recycled cans
And get well cars to the hostage vans Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
Don't let the sun catch you cryin' You're a deadweight, right straight
On your way
Sunk in the midnight shade
Skies burned, eyes turned
Learning to counterfeit their disease
In this town where we roam
We bluff our souls
In canteen patios
Drink the bravest draught
The music drags
The music drags
The music drags Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
Don't let the sun catch you cryin' Spaceships can't tame the jungle
And I feel like I'm giving in
We've been driving through a desert
Looking for a life to call our own I push, I pull
The days go slow
Into a void
We filled with death
A noise that laughs
Falls off their maps
All cured of pain
And doubts in your
Little brain Something's coming, sky is purple
Dogs are hounding to themselves
Days are changing with the weather
Like a riptide come rip us away I push, I pull
The days go slow
Into a void
We filled with death
A noise that laughs
Falls off their maps
All cured of pain
And doubts in your
Little brain I push, I pull
The days go slow
Into a void
We filled with death
A noise that laughs
Falls off thier maps
All cured of pain
And doubts in your I'm on a tangent
Textbook ephemeral
Facts are confusing me
I'm so free now I'm on a one-man waiting list
I'm bored again
I buried all my memories
I'm so free now I see the silhouette of everything
I thought I ever knew
Turning into voodoo

Feel it out until you know
It wasn't meant for you

I'm so free now
And the way that I walk
Is up to me now
And if I breathe now
I could scream now
You can hear me

I'm gonna freeze out
These enemies out
They never see what I got
No need to bend my knees down
Heaven forbid
Time is running out
Nothing new under the sun
Better get down I'm so free

I'm so free
I'm so free
I'm so free
Free from me
Free from you
I'm so free
I'm so free
I'm so free from you
I'm so free from you Who am I supposed to be
In the middle of the day
With no good connection?
I'm so free now They try to keep me down
With affliction
Alpha male fell asleep in the engine
I'm so free now A horizontal aspiration
In the basement
With a digital lust for life
I'm so free now I coin the phrase of the realm
Let it roll into the street
Like a token of sweet nothing
I'm so free now I'm so free now
I'm so free now
And the way that I walk
Is up to me now
And if I breathe now
I could scream now
You can hear me
From Topeka to Belize now
I'm gonna freeze out
These enemies out
They never see what I got
No need to bend my knees down
Heaven forbid
Time is running out

Nobody's going to keep me down
Nobody's going to keep me down, down
Gonna do, gonna do, gonna do what we want I don't want to go (nobody's going to keep me down)
I don't want to go (nobody's going to keep me down)

I'm so free from you I'm so free now She took me off my guard with disappointment
I got sucked inside of her apartment
She's got dried up flowers, flakey skin
A beaded necklace and a bottle of gin She's a nitemare hippy girl
With her skinny fingers fondlin' my world
She's a whimsical, tragical beauty
Self-conscious and a little bit moody It's a new-age letdown in my face
She's so spaced out, and there ain't no space
She's got marijuana on the bathroom tile
I'm caught in a vortex, she's changing my style She's a nitemare hippy girl
With her skinny fingers fondlin' my world
She's a whimsical, tragical beauty
Uptight and a little bit snooty She's a magical, sparkling tease
She's a rainbow choking the breeze
Yeah oh, she's busting out onto the scene
With nitemare bogus poetry She's a melted avocado on the shelf
She's the science of herself
She's spazzing out on a cosmic level
And she's meditating with the devil She's cooking salad for breakfast
She's got tofu the size of Texas
She's a witness to her own glory
She's a neverending story She's a frolicking depression
She's a self-inflicted obsession
She's got a thousand lonely husbands
She's playing footsie in another dimension She's a goddess milking her time
For all that it's worth Put your hands on the wheel
Let the golden age begin
Let the window down
Feel the moonlight on your skin
Let the desert wind
Cool your aching head
Let the weight of the world
Drift away instead These days I barely get by
I don't even try It's a treacherous road
With a desolated view
There's distant lights
But here they're far and few
And the sun don't shine
Even when its day
You gotta drive all night
Just to feel like you're okay These days I barely get by
I don't even try, I don't even try Waking light, it grew from the shadow
Brace yourself to the morning low
Night is gone, long way turning
You've waited long enough to know When the memory leaves you
Somewhere you can't make it home
When the morning comes to meet you
Lay me down in waking light No one sees you here, roots are all covered
There's such a life to go and how much can you show?
Day is gone on a landslide of rhythm
It's in your lamplight burning low When the memory leaves you
Somewhere you can't make it home
When the morning comes to meet you
Rest your eyes in waking light When the memory leaves you
Somewhere you can't make it home
When the morning comes to meet you
Open your eyes with waking light I been drifting along
In the same stale shoes
Loose ends tyin' a noose
In the back of my mind
If you thought that you were making your way
To where the puzzles and pagans lay
I'll put it together
It's a strange invitation When I wake up
Someone will sweep up my lazy bones
And we will rise in the cool of the evening
I remember the way that you smiled
When the gravity shackles were wild
And something is vacant
When I think it's all beginning I been drifting along
In the same stale shoes
Loose ends tyin' a noose
In the back of my mind
If you thought that you were making your way
To where the puzzles and pagans lay
I'll put it together
It's a strange invitation I move away from this place
In the form of a disturbance
And enter into the world
Like some tiny distortion If I surrender
And I don't fight this wave
No I won't go under
I'll only get carried away Wave
Wave
Wave Isolation
Isolation
Isolation
Isolation I've been drifting along in the same stale old shoes
Loose ends tying a noose in the back of my mind
If you thought that you were making your way
To where the puzzles and pagans lay
I'll put it together, it's a strange invitation When I wake up and someone will sweep up my lazy bones
And we will rise in the cool of the evening
I remember the way that you smiled
When the gravity shackles were wild
Something is vacant when I think it's all beginning And I've been drifting along in the same stale old shoes
The loose ends tying a noose in the back of my mind
If you thought that you were making your way
To where the puzzles and pagans lay
Put it together, it's a strange invitation And it's a strange invitation
And it's a strange invitation
It's a strange invitation
It's a strange invitation When we, when we looking for a better home
Got me, got me burning out a light bulb
Cloudy, cloudy, holding to a wastecan
Yellow car, yellow car, put me inside there Wake up, wake up, nothing's gonna harm you
Glass wall, glass wall standing on the furniture
Little boy, little boy layin' in a sleeping bag
Watchin', watchin' through the cracks in his eyelids Stranger, stranger feeding on the broken snow
Lost head, lost tread staring through the orange juice
Alphabet, alphabet can't afford a telephone
Blackhole, blackhole nothing's gonna harm you Hot milk
Mmmm... tweak my nipple
Champagne and ripple
Shamans go cripple
My sales go triple
We drop lobotomy beats
Evaporated meats
On hi-tech street
We go solo
Dance floors and talk shows
Hot dogs, No Doz
Hot Sex in back rows I wanna know what makes you scream
Be your twenty million dollar fantasy
Treat you real good
Expensive jeans
Hollywood freaks on the Hollywood scene Touch it real good if you want a piece
Party people know I'm that type of freak People look so snooty
Take pills make them moody
Automatic bzooty
Zero to tutti fruitti
Sex in the halls
Niagra Falls
Local shopping malls receive
Anonymous calls
Hot like a cheetah
Neon mamacita
Eat at tacoria
Pop lockin' beats from Korea
Looking like jail bait
Selling lots of real estate
Looking like a hot date
Banging like an 808 Do you want to feel this?
Do you want to feel this? Norman Schwartzkoff
Something tells me you want to go home
Champagne, bibles
Custom clothes you own
Calling up from special area codes
Hollywood nuns with the Hollywood phones
I got nothing to do, nowhere to go
I'll tell you what you want
If you want to know
Satin sheets
Tropical oils
Turn up the heat
Till the swimming pool boils
Let all the neighbors
Read it in the papers
Making all those gentlemen cry
Realistic tears Jockin my Mercedes
Probably have my baby
Shop at Old Navy
He wish he was a Lady I really think I better get a hold of myself
Don't wanna let the night get ahead of myself
Whisperin' her love through a smoke ring smile
She doesn't know what happens when she's around I think I'm in love
But it makes me kinda nervous to say so
I think I'm in love
But it makes me kinda nervous to say so Doodododododooodoo Probably lay my head on a wooden floor
Tell her I was tired from working the store
Counting all the cash from an old shoebox
Saving up to buy her something she wants I think I'm in love
But it makes me kinda nervous to say so
I think I'm in love
But it makes me kinda nervous to say so What if it's wrong?
What if it's wrong
To pray in vain?
What does it mean
To fake your death?
To wake up tainted? Take a little picture in a photobooth
Keep it in a locket and I think of you
Both of our pictures, face to face
Take off your necklace and throw it away I think I'm in love
But it makes me kinda nervous to say so
I think I'm in love
But it makes me kinda nervous to say so Really think I better get a hold of myself
Don't wanna let the night get ahead of myself
Whisperin' her love through a smoke ring smile
She doesn't know what happens when she's around I think I'm in love
Think I'm in love
Think I'm in love
Think I'm in love
Think I'm in love
Think I'm in love
Think I'm in love
Think I'm in love *hidden track on Mutations* Looking back at some dead world that looks so new,
Offices and fountains that they named for you,
Dazzlements of accidents rejoice their doom,
Hari-karis spinning round the golden looms. Girl you dream infectious from a nauseous heart,
Choice cut meats from derelict boulevards. Hear that lonesome whistle blow,
No direction to be known,
In a senile revelry. A tearful gaze turns away,
Emoting cold and grey,
scentec eunuchs clothe our wretchedness. Looking back at some dead world that looks so new,
Offices and fountains that they named for you,
So ungrateful to the who's and what's-his-face,
Terrorist confections look so out of place. Looking back at some dead world that looks so new...(5x) (instrumental) I've seen the end of the day come too soon
Not a lot to say, not a lot to do
You played the game, you owe nothing to yourself
Rest a day, for tomorrow you can't tell
You can't tell I've seen the end of the day come too late
Seen the love you had turning into hate
Had to act like I didn't even care
But I did so I got stranded standing there
Standing there It's nothing that I haven't seen before
But it still kills me like it did before
No it's nothing that I haven't seen before
But it still kills me like it did before I've seen the end of the day come too soon
Like the prison dogs they set out after you
You owe nothing to the past but wasted time
To serve a sentence that was only in your mind
In your mind It's nothing that I haven't seen before
But it still kills me like it did before
No it's nothing that I haven't seen before
But it still kills me like it did before No money, no honey
No money, no honey

From something you can't see
Follow it where it goes
Follow it back to me
I'll keep it here Don't let it go
Don't let it go
Don't let it go
Don't let it go away
You don't have to let it go away These are some faults we found
Hollowed out from the years
Don't let them wear you out
Don't let them turn your mind inside out Don't let it go
Don't let it go away
Don't let it go
Don't let it go away
You don't have to let it go away In the crossfire there's a story
And how it ends, I do not know Don't let it go
Don't let it go away
Don't let it go
Don't let it go away Don't you see how far it's gone away?
Don't you see how far it's gone away?
Don't you see how far it's gone away?
Don't you see how far it's gone away?
You don't have to let it go away I've been watching the wheels turning
But I'm learning to enjoy the ride
On the road to nowhere
I hope we get there soon
'cause it's a place we've been before
Knocking on purgatory's door
To find a place in the sun
A chameleon changing colors on demand 'Cause this is life and it's alright
Taking detours in your mind
You'll be fine if you try
To keep your eyes on the consolation prize
When you lower your expectations
And you've run out of patience
It's all a part of the plan when you're lost in the world
And you're going down hard for the girl I've been running the lights in the city
Saying 'who can I be running from?'
My demons told my skeletons 'he won't get very far'
And when I got to the dark side of the moon
All the trouble I thought I knew, it left me out in the cold
Spinning out of control on a broken carousel Now tell me this is life and it's alright
Chasing windmills in your mind
You'll be fine if you try
To keep your eyes on the consolation prize
On the road to tomorrow
Gonna have to beg, steal, or borrow
It's all a part of the plan when you're dead to the world
And you're going down hard for the girl For the girl
For the girl
For the girl
For the girl
See you on the other side of love all alone
Sooner or later at the end of the world
See you on the other side of love all alone
Sooner or later at the end of the world 'Cause this is life and it's alright
Taking detours in your mind
You'll be fine if you try
To keep your eyes on the consolation prize
On the road to Valhalla
Karma riding shotgun with drama
It's all a part of the plan when you're lost in the world
And you're going down hard for the girl Momma don't take me
down to the den
to make it by myself (?)
it'll rip me away (?) Pulled by the drapes

Tell your parents on your teacher
(?) Tell your parents and your teacher
When something strange happens to you
Tell your parents and your teacher
When something strange happens to you (some kind of whimpering) (breathing) Here comes the vegetable man in the
Vegetable van with the horn that's honking
Like a mariachi band in the middle of the street
People gather around put a dollar in the can
Ay wey, qué onda? tj cowboys hang around
Sleeping on the side walk with a burger king
Crown never wake them up mas cerveza till
The rooster crows vatos vergallos Qué onda guero?
Qué onda guero? Mano blancos roll with crowbars sing
Rancheras on cheap guitars abuelitas with
Plastic bags walking to church with their Spanish candles dirty boracho says "qué putas?
Andelay joto, your popsicles melting"
Run better run da doo run run in the midnight sun Guero where you going? Qué onda guero?
Rampart boys with loaded rifles guatemalan
Soccer ball instant replays mango ladies
Vendedoras at a bus stop
Sing a banda macho chorus Qué onda guero? A donde Vayas? Make a move with what you can,
Dead waters rise higher than your mind. Disappointment is a feather in your cap,
You want the truth so you can crush it in your hand. There's no map,
I can tell you where you are,
You're in between things that only go half way,
Your tangled brain,
A tired old refrain,
You'd be singing it in the tired old silence. You want the best,
You want contest,
My eyes are filled with prizes you've been showin'.
Disappointment is the card up your sleeve,
Place your bets at the door before you leave. Oh country down
Where I found my proving ground
All along the floodline
Wheels are turning around
The hills roll out like centuries
Pass by without a sound
Just a mile outside of town Downriverbound
Where the limit to your sky fell down
A plot against your will
Is furrowed into your brow
Against your better judgment
It's all behind you now
Just a mile outside of town What's the use in being found
When you can lose yourself in some good ground?
In the weeds hiding downriver right next door
There's no frame around your picture
Just a view through my back door Time evermore
You just found what you're looking for
A tiger rose growing through your prison door
Reaching for sunlight, can't see it anymore
Just a mile from my back door You could wake up on a lifeboat 'neath the sun
On a ladder up to the sky
You're standing on the lowest rung
Holding a lifeline, using my best defense
Running in the undertow I couldn't fight against Oh lay me down
Where we found my proving ground
All along the floodline
Waves are turning around
The hills roll out like centuries
Pass by without a sound I prayed Heaven today
Bring its hammer down on me
And pound you out of my head
I can't think with you in it I dragged all that I owned
Down the dirt road to find you
My shoes worn out and used
They can't take me much farther Something always takes the place of missing pieces
You can take and put together even though
You know there's something missing Something always takes the place of missing pieces
You can take and put together even though
You know there's something missing She rides in a car, like a queen on a card
And the guns of her mind, aim a line straight at mine
To a heart that was broke, tried to feel but got choked
In the smoke of a desert, a beach with no treasure A night that's so blue, feed the aching in you
And the background birds, take a flight from the earth
Where the bonfire burns and the night current turns
On a lifeboat floating, down a river of sleep I can't see her hollow eyes
I'm walkin' along with my boots full of rocks
I can't believe these tears were mine
I'll give them to you to keep away in a box I'll give them to you to keep away in a box
I'll give them to you to keep away in a box
I'll give them to you to keep away in a box Something always takes the place of missing pieces
You can take and put together even though
You know there's something missing Something always missing
Always someone missing something
Something always missing
Always someone missing something Something always missing
Always someone missing something
Something always missing
Always someone missing something I can't believe what we've seen outside
You and me watching the jets go by
Oh, Oooh, Oh
Oh, Oooh, Oh Drown by sea, so many people've already drowned
You and me watching a sea full of people
Try not to drown So many people, so many people
Where do they go?
You and me watching a sky
Full of chemtrails
That's where we belong All I can take from these skies is hope
But all I can see in this light are boats
Sinking
Oh, Oooh, Oh
Oh, Oooh, Oh Down by the sea swallowed by evil
They've already drowned
You and me watching a sea of people
Already drowned So many people, so many people
Where do they go?
You and me hit by a test of white evil rain
Watching the jet planes go by You and me watching
You and me watching
The chemtrails is where we belong
That's where we'll be when we die in the slipstream
We'll climb in a hole in the sky I've seen the end of the day come too soon
Not a lot to say, not a lot to do
You played the game, you owe nothing to yourself
Rest a day, for tomorrow you can't tell
You can't tell I've seen the end of the day come too late
Seen the love you had turning into hate
Had to act like I didn't even care
But I did so I got stranded standing there
Standing there It's nothing that I haven't seen before
But it still kills me like it did before
No it's nothing that I haven't seen before
But it still kills me like it did before I've seen the end of the day come too soon
Like the prison dogs they set out after you
You owe nothing to the past but wasted time
To serve a sentence that was only in your mind
In your mind It's nothing that I haven't seen before
But it still kills me like it did before
No it's nothing that I haven't seen before
But it still kills me like it did before I want to see you
With the pharaoh's curse
The apple flower doggerel
The batteries burst
And I'm out in the city
In the typical noise
With the suntan ellipse
And the filigree of energy
What you want and what you need
Now I'm down on my knees
With a pocket full of widows
You can do it down here
What you never did there
When you feel so untethered
From the broken veneer Don't tell nobody I'm here
Don't tell nobody I'm here
Now I'm far from the world
In your seventh heaven
Now I'm far from the world
In your seventh heaven Now you got to let me know
Now you got to let me go
Now you got to let me know
Or you got to let me go I'm gonna take it with me
I'm gonna take it with me
I'm gonna take it with me
I'm gonna take it down, take it down with me A second language
A burden of hope
I've seen it all come clean
Like a guillotine rose
A photograph
A low life laugh
We'll shoot for the empire
Land in the dust pile
I want to wake up
In the shadow of a fever pitch
With the gold glass heart
Sending messages
I hear the voice over the phone
She pauses
Says 'I'll never, never, never go' Oh can I stay here with you?
Oh can I stay here with you?
Now I'm dead to the world
In your seventh heaven
Now I'm dead to the world
In your seventh heaven Now you got to let me know
Now you got to let me go
Now you got to let me know
Or you got to let me go I'm gonna take it with me Someday there might be something better
You can change your mind but you can't forget her
Someday there might be something better
You can change your mind but you can't forget her So let it rise to the highest high
In the satellite sky
So let it rise to the highest high
In the satellite sky
Up to the seventh heaven
To your seventh heaven
So let it rise, rise, rise
To the highest height
In the satellite sky Now I'm starting to fall
From your seventh heaven
Now I'm starting to fall
From your seventh heaven Now you got to let me know
Now you got to let me go
Now you got to let me know
Or you got to let me go Love a love a love a love
Love a love a love a love
Love a love a love a love
Love a love a love a love (your seventh heaven)
Love a love a love a love
Love a love a love a love (your seventh heaven) I feel uptight when I walk in the city
I feel so cold when I'm at home
Feels like everything's starting to hit me
I lost my bearings ten minutes ago Modern guilt - I'm stranded with nothing
Modern guilt - I'm under lock-and-key
Misapprehension is turning into convention
Don't know what I've done but I feel ashamed Standing outside the glass on the sidewalk
These people talk about impossible things
And I'm falling out of the conversation
Like a pawn piece in a human shield Modern guilt is all in our hands
Modern guilt won't get me to bed
Say what you will - smoke your last cigarette
Don't know what I've done but I feel afraid Drive to the night
Far as it goes
Away from the daylight
Into the afterglow Somewhere unforgiven
Time will wait for you Down on the street
Just let the engine run
'Til there's nothing left
Except the damage done Somewhere unforgiven
I will wait for you Somewhere unforgiven
Time will wait for you Somewhere unforgiven
I will wait for you Satan gave me a taco and it made me really sick
The chicken was all raw and the grease was mighty thick
The rice was all rancid and the beans were so hard
I was gettin' kinda dizzy eatin' all the lard
There was aphids on the lettuce an' I ate every one
An' after I was done the salsa melted off my tongue
Pieces of tortilla got stuck in my throat
An' the stains on my clothes burned a hole through my coat
My stomach was a-tremblin' and I broke out in a rash
I was so dry and thirsty and I didn't have no cash
So I went and found a hose, tore off all my clothes
Turned on the water and it shot right up my nose
Some old lady came along and she thought I was a freak
So she beat me with a handbag till I could hardly speak
I was lying there naked, my body badly bruised
In a pool of my own blood, unconscious and confused
Well, the cops came and got me and threw me in their van
And I woke up on the ceiling and I couldn't find my hand
They took me to the judge, his eyes a-glowin' red
The courtroom was filled with witches and the dead
Well, the sheriff was a hellhound with fangs and claws
The prisoners were tied up and chained to the walls
The air was gettin' thick; the smoke was gettin' thicker
The judge read the verdict: said, "Cut off his head!"
Well, they placed me on the altar, and they raised up the axe
My head was about to explode when I noticed the Marshall stacks
I noticed all the smoke machines, cameras and the lights
Some guy with a microphone, runnin' around dancin' in tights
And I noticed the crew and the band playin' down below
And I realized I was in a rock video So I went and joined the band
And I went out on tour
And I smoked a lot of heroin
And I passed out in manure
I made out with the groupies
Come on here
Started fires backstage
Oh, yeah, started 'em all
Made a lot of money
Oh, yeah, I'm makin' it
And I gave it all away
Give it all to me
Well, the band got killed
Ah, bunch of losers
So I started a solo career
Aha, yeah
And I won all the awards
Get 'em all now
And I drank all the beer
Drink it all up; get funky
I opened up a taco stand
Aha
Just to smell the smell
Oho

fryin' down in hell Ozzy

Let's get lost Let's get lost
Let's get lost
Let's get lost
Let's get lost These withered hands have dug for a dream
Sifted through sand and leftover nightmares
Over the hill, a desolate wind
Turns shit to gold and blows my soul crazy The end
O the end
We live again
O i grow weary of the end O hungry days in the footsteps of fools
Gazing alone through sex-painted windows
Dredging the night, drunk libertines
Stink like colognes from the newfangled wasteland The end
O the end
We live again
O I grow weary of the end Love is a plague in a mix-match parade
Where the castaways look so deranged
When will the children learn to let their wildernesses burn
And love will be new never cold and vacant These withered hands have dug for a dream
Sifted through sand and leftover nightmares The end
Of the end
We live again
O I grow weary of the end Turn turn away
From the sound of your own voice
Calling no one, just a silence
Run to see you at the edge
Fall off the avalanche
Turn away Hold hold the light
That fixes you in time
Keeps you under
Takes you over the wall
That love divides between waking and slumber
Turn away Turn turn away
From the weight of your own past
It's magic for the devil
And betray the lack of change
Once you have spoken
Turn away

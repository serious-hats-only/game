When I think of home
I think of a place where there's
Love overflowing;
I wish I was home,
I wish I was back there,
With the things I've been knowing.
Wind that makes the tall trees bend into leaning,
Suddenly the snowflakes that fall
Have a meaning.
Sprinkling the scene, makes it all clean.
Maybe there;s a chance
For me to go back
Now that I have some direction;
It sure would be nice to be back home,
Where there's love and affection.
And just maybe I can convince time
To slow up.
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up;
Time, please be my friend,and let me start again...
Suddenly my world is gonna change its face
But I still know where I'm going;
I have had my mind spun around and around
In space
And yet I've watched it growing.
Oh, I know you're listening Lord,
So won't you please don't make it hard
I know I shouldn't believe everything, everything
That things we see.
Tell me, should I try and stay
Or maybe I should run away
Would it be better, better
Just to let things be?
Living here in this brand-new world
Might be a fantasy; yes it might be
But it taught me to love,
So I know that it's real, its real, real to me...
And I've learned that we must look
Inside our hearts to find...
Yeah we gotta find
A world full of love
Like yours, like mine-
Like Home Share my life
Take me for what I am
'Cause I'll never change
All my colors for you Take my love
I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are
And everything that you do I don't really need to look
Very much further
I don't want to have to go
Where you don't follow
I will hold it back again
This passion inside
Can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you, you, you, you You see through
Right to the heart of me
You break down my walls
With the strength of your love I never knew
Love like I've known it with you
Will a memory survive
One I can hold on to? I don't really need to look
Very much further
I don't want to have to go
Where you don't follow
I will hold it back again
This passion inside
I can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide
Your love I'll remember forever Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
No, don't walk away from me
Don't you dare walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you
If I don't have you, oh, oh If I should stay, I'll only be in your way
So I'll go, but I know I'll
Think of you every step of the way And I will always love you
I will always love you
You, my darling you, hmmm, Bittersweet memories
That is all I'm taking with me
So, goodbye
Please, don't cry
We both know I'm not what you, you need And I will always love you
I will always love you I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of
And I wish to you, joy and happiness
But above all this, I wish you love And I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I, I will always love you You, darling, I love you
Oh, I'll always, I'll always love you I believe the children are our are future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
Everybody searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfill my needs A lonely place to be
So I learned to depend on me I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all And if by chance, that special place
That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in love As I lay me down
Heaven hear me now
I'm lost without a cause
After giving it my all Winter storms have come
And darkened my sun
After all that I've been through
Who on earth can I turn to I look to you
I look to you After all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong I look to you
I look to you Yeah And when melodies are gone
In you I hear a song I look to you After losing my breath
There's no more fighting left
Sinking to rise no more
Searching for that open door And every road that I've taken
Led to my regret
And I don't know if I'm gonna make it
Nothing to do but lift my head I look to you
I look to you Yeah And when all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong I look to you
I look to you Oh yeah And when melodies are gone
In you I hear a song I look to you (my levies have broken, my walls have come) Coming down on me (crumbling down on me) All the rain is falling (the rain is falling, defeat is calling) Set me free (I need you to set me free) Take me far away from the battle
I need you
Shine on me I look to you
I look to you After all my strength has gone
In you I can be strong I look to you
I look to you And when melodies are gone
In you I hear a song I look to you Yeah I look to you
I look to you Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up to now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls, loneliness calls Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me Somebody oo Somebody oo
Somebody who loves me yeah
Somebody oo Somebody oo
To hold me in his arms oh
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody

A day to give
The best of me

But not alone
My finest day

Fought every gain
To taste the sweet

How will I know, ooo
How will I know, how will I know, hey how will I know, how will I know Many nights we prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hope for a song
We barely understood Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains
Long before we knew we could, whoa, yes There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
Its hard to kill Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe somehow you will
You will when you believe (Mmmmmmmmmyeah)
Mmmyeah
In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain Hope seems like the summer bird
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My hearts so full, I can't explain Seeking faith and speakin' words
I never thought I'd say
There can be miracles
When you believe (When you believe) Though hope is frail
Its hard to kill (Mmm)
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (You can achieve) When you believe somehow you will
You will when you believe
(Hey)
(Ooh) They don't always happen when you ask
And its easy to give in to your fears
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see the way, get through the rain A small but still, resilient voice
Says hope is very near, oh (Oh)
There can be miracles (Miracles)
When you believe (Boy, when you believe, yeah) (Though hope is frail) Though hope is frail (Its hard)
Its hard to kill (Hard to kill, oh, yeah)
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (You can achieve, oh) When you believe somehow you will (Somehow, somehow, somehow)
Somehow you will (I know, I know, know)
You will when you believe (When you)
(Oh oh) (You will when you)
(You will when you believe)
(Ohoohooh)
(Oh, oh) (When you believe)
(When you believe) Lost touch with my soul
I had no where to turn
I had no where to go
Lost sight of my dream, Thought it would be the end of me
I thought I'd never make it through
I had no hope to hold on to,
I thought I would break I didn't know my own strength
And I crashed down, and I tumbled
But I did not crumble
I got through all the pain I didn't know my own strength
Survived my darkest hour
My faith kept me alive
I picked myself back up Hold my head up high
I was not built to break
I didn't know my own strength Found hope in my heart,
I found the light to life
My way out the dark
Found all that I need
Here inside of me I thought I'd never find my way
I thought I'd never lift that weight
I thought I would break I didn't know my own strength
And I crashed down, and I tumbled
But I did not crumble
I got through all the pain I didn't know my own strength
Survived my darkest hour
My faith kept me alive
I picked myself back up Hold my head up high
I was not built to break
I didn't know my own strength There were so many times I
Wondered how I'd get through the night I
Thought took all I could take I didn't know my own strength
And I crashed down, and I tumbled
But I did not crumble
I got through all the pain I didn't know my own strength
Survived my darkest hour
My faith kept me alive
I picked myself back up Hold my head up high
I was not built to break
I didn't know my own strength I was not built to break
I got to know my own strength Impossible!
For a plain yellow pumpkin to become a golden carriage
Impossible
For a plain country bumpkin and a prince to join in marriage
And four white mice could never be turned to horses
Such falder-all-and-fiddley-dee-of-courses

But the world is full of zanies and fools
Who don't believe in sensible rules
and won't believe what sensible people say

and so Cinderella goes to the ball (Clap your hands y'all, it's alright...) If tomorrow is judgment day (Sing Mommy)
And I'm standing on the front line
And the Lord asks me what I did with my life
I will say I spent it with you If I wake up in World War III
I see destruction and poverty
And I feel like I want to go home
It's okay if you're coming with me 'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us If I lose my fame and fortune
And I'm homeless on the street
And I'm sleeping in Grand Central Station
It's okay if you're sleeping with me As the years they pass us by
We stay young through each other's eyes
And no matter how old we get
It's okay as long as I got you baby 'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us If I should die this very day
Don't cry, 'cause on Earth we weren't meant to stay
And no matter what the people say
I'll be waiting for you after the judgment day 'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us A few stolen moments is all that we share
You've got your family and they need you there
Though I've tried to resist being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you It's not very easy living all alone
My friends try and tell me find a man of my own
But each time I try I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you You used to tell me we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said be patient just wait a little longer
But that's just an old fantasy I've got to get ready just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling when you walk through that door
'Cause tonight is the night for feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love for you
Yes I'm saving all my love
Yes I'm saving all my love for you No other woman is gonna love you more
'Cause tonight is the night that I'm feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yeah I'm saving all my lovin'
Yes I'm saving all my love for you
For you Count on me through thick and thin
A friendship that will never end
When you are weak, I will be strong
Helping you to carry on
Call on me, I will be there, don't be afraid
Please believe me when I say, count on I can see that it's hurting you, I can feel your pain

But if you would only take the time

A girl who's scared sometimes
Who isn't always strong
Can't you see the hurt in me?
I feel so all alone I wanna run to you (oooh)
I wanna run to you (oooh)
Won't you hold me in your arms
And keep me safe from harm
I want to run to you (oooh)
But if I come to you (oooh)
Tell me, will you stay or will you run away Each day, each day I play the role
Of someone always in control
But at night I come home and turn the key
There's nobody there, no one cares for me
What's the sense of trying hard to find your dreams
Without someone to share it with
Tell me what does it mean? I wanna run to you (oooh)
I wanna run to you (oooh)
Won't you hold me in your arms
And keep me safe from harm
I want to run to you (oooh)
But if I come to you (oooh) Tell me, will you stay or will you run away
I need you here
I need you here to wipe away my tears
To kiss away my fears
If you only knew how much I wanna run to you (oooh)
I wanna run to you (oooh)
Won't you hold me in your arms
And keep me safe from harm
I want to run to you (oooh)
But if I come to you (oooh)
Tell me, will you stay or will you run away All at once
I finally took a moment
And I'm realizing that
You're not coming back
And it's finally hit me all at once
All at once I've started counting teardrops
And at least a million fell
My eyes began to swell
And all my dreams were shattered all at once Ever since I met you
You're the only love I've known
And I can't forget you
Though I must face it all alone All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And that's all that matters now
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Holding on to memories
And it's hurt me more than you know
So much more than it shows
All at once All at once I looked around and found that you were
With another love
In someone else's arms
And all my dreams were shattered all at once
All at once the smile that used to greet me
Brightened someone else's day
She took your smile away
And left me with just memories all at once Ever since I met you
You're the only love I've known
And I can't forget you
Though I must face it all alone All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And that's all that matters now
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Holding on to memories
And it's hurt me more than you know
So much more than it shows
All at once All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And it's hurt me more than you know
So much more than it shows
All at once
And that's all that matters now
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And it's hurt me more than you know
So much more Remember when we held on in the rain
The night we almost lost it
Once again we can take the night into tomorrow
Living on feelings
Touching you I feel it all again Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving?
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
Didn't we almost have it all
The night we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all The way you used to touch me felt so fine
We kept our hearts together down the line
A moment in the soul can last forever
Comfort and keep us
Help me bring the feeling back again Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving?
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
Didn't we almost have it all
The night we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all Didn't we have the best of times
When love was young and new?
Couldn't we reach inside and find
The world of me and you?
We'll never lose it again
'Cause once you know what love is
You never let it end Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving?
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living Didn't we almost have it all
The night we held on till the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all Give us this day
Our daily bread
You said you would
Supply all my needs
According to your riches
I have but to ask
And I shall receive To go from here
And share this love
You gave to me
To show someone who is lost
And help them find their way
The way to truth and faith
So they can be free Be free like me
Be free like me Oh Lord, we need your love
Oh Lord, we need your peace
Oh Lord, we need your joy
On this day Thank you, Lord
I thank you for this day. I'm wiser now
I'm not the foolish girl you used to know
So long ago
I'm stronger now
I've learned from my mistakes which way to go
And I should know
I put myself aside to do it your way
But now I need to do it all alone And I am not afraid to try it on my own
I don't care if I'm right or wrong
I'll live my life the way I feel
No matter what I'll keep it real, you know
Time for me to do it on my own
Yeah yeah, mmm, yeah yeah It's over now
I can't go back to living through your eyes
Too many lines
And if you don't know by now
I can't go back to being someone else
Not anymore
I never had a chance to do things my way
So now it's time for me to take control And I am not afraid to try it on my own
I don't care if I'm right or wrong
I'll live my life the way I feel
No matter what I'm gonna keep it real you know
Time for me to do it Oh, I start again go back to one
I'm running things in my way
Can't stop me now, I've just begun
Don't even think about it
There ain't no way about it
I'm taking names, the ones of mine
Yes I'm gonna take my turn
It's time for me to finally stand alone, stand alone I am not afraid to try it on my own
And I don't care if I'm right or wrong
I'll live my life the way I feel
No matter what I'm gonna keep it real, you know
It's time for me to do it
See I'm not afraid to try it on my own
And I don't care if I'm right or wrong
I'll live my life the way I feel
No matter what I'm gonna keep it real, you know
It's time for me to do it on my own, hey, on my own If you say my eyes are beautiful,
It's because they're looking at you.
And if you could only see yourself,
You'd feel the same way too. You could say that I am a dreamer
Who's had a dream come true.
If you say my eyes are beautiful,
It's because they're looking at you. If you're wondering why I'm smiling,
It's because I'm happy with you.
And the warm sensations touch my heart,
And fill me through and through. I could hold you close forever,
And never let you go.
If you say my eyes are beautiful,
It's because I just love you so. Now my heart is an open door;
Won't you come inside for more?
You can love so sweetly now;
Take my love, take me completely now. Oh... if you say my eyes are beautiful,
It's because they're looking for you.
And my eyes adjust the window
For my feelings to come through. And by far, you are more beautiful
Than anything I ever knew
If you say my eyes are beautiful,
If you say my eyes are beautiful,
If you say my eyes are beautiful,
It's because (it's because) they're looking at you. I know it's been some time
But there's something on my mind
You see, I haven't been the same
Since that cold November day
We said we needed space
But all we found was an empty place
And the only things I learned
Is that I need you desperately So here I am
And can you please tell me, oh Where do broken hearts go
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care, for me I've been around enough to know
That dreams don't turn to gold
And that there is no easy way
No you just can't run away
And what we have is so much more
Than we ever had before
And no matter how I try
You're always on my mind So here I am
And can you please tell me, oh Where do broken hearts go
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me And now that I am here with you
I'll never let you go
I look into your eyes
And now I know, now I know Where do broken hearts go
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care Where do broken hearts go
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me, for me
You still care for me I used to cry myself to sleep at night
But that was all before he came
I thought love had to hurt to turn out right
But now he's here
It's not the same
It's not the same He fills me up
He gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I've got
He's all I've got in this world
But he's all the man that I need And in the morning when I kiss his eyes
He takes me down and rocks me slow
And in the evening when the moon is high
He holds me close
And won't let go
He won't let go He fills me up
He gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I've got
He's all I've got in this world
But he's all the man that I need He fills me up
He gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I've got
He's all I've got in this world
But he's all the man that I need He fills me up
He gives me love
More more more love, more love, more love, more than I've ever seen
He's all I've got
He's all I've got in this world
But he's all the man, all the man Yes Jesus loves me for the Bible tells me so
Jesus loves me this I know
For the Bible tells me so
Little ones to him belong
They are weak but he is strong Yes Jesus loves me
Oh, yes Jesus loves me
Yes Jesus loves me for the Bible tells me so Pressing on the up away
Always guide me Lord I pray
Undeserving, and stubbornly never fail to love me still Yes Jesus loves me
Oh yes Jesus loves me
Oh yes Jesus loves me, for the Bible tells me so
Yes Jesus loves me, love
Oh yes Jesus loves me for the Bible tells me so
For the Bible tells me so (Feels so good to know) that I'm never alone
See, sometimes I'm lonely but never alone
For the Bible tells, for the Bible tells
For the Bible tells me so See I know that he loves me
Whether I'm right, whether I'm wrong When I think of home
I think of a place where there's
Love overflowing;
I wish I was home,
I wish I was back there,
With the things I've been knowing.
Wind that makes the tall trees bend into leaning,
Suddenly the snowflakes that fall
Have a meaning.
Sprinkling the scene, makes it all clean.
Maybe there;s a chance
For me to go back
Now that I have some direction;
It sure would be nice to be back home,
Where there's love and affection.
And just maybe I can convince time
To slow up.
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up;
Time, please be my friend,and let me start again...
Suddenly my world is gonna change its face
But I still know where I'm going;
I have had my mind spun around and around
In space
And yet I've watched it growing.
Oh, I know you're listening Lord,
So won't you please don't make it hard
I know I shouldn't believe everything, everything
That things we see.
Tell me, should I try and stay
Or maybe I should run away
Would it be better, better
Just to let things be?
Living here in this brand-new world
Might be a fantasy; yes it might be
But it taught me to love,
So I know that it's real, its real, real to me...
And I've learned that we must look
Inside our hearts to find...
Yeah we gotta find
A world full of love
Like yours, like mine-
Like Home Oh yeah
Nothing's better than family,
For the ones who love you so
Be a shoulder to cry on when you are in need
They will never leave you alone
When your friends bring you down
And they drag you through the dirt
And nobody is around
They will carry you through the hurt Just remember that family comes first
Where you gonna run to? when no one is around
Do you think how dare they will love you.
When your face is on the ground? (face is on the ground),
When you feel your strength is almost gone
And When your heart is getting weak (getting weak)
And you don't think you can keep holding on
And they stand for your feet (just remember)
Family comes first I can see you crying someone broke your heart,
Instead of being with those who love you,
You spend time apart, it's because you think
They won't understand
The pain you're going through, So you don't reach out your
Hand for them, 'til they'll pull and reach for you. Just remember that family comes first
Where you gonna run to? when no one is around
Do you think how dare they will love you.
When your face is on the ground? (face is on the ground),
When you feel your strength is almost gone
And When your heart is getting weak (getting weak)
And you don't think you can keep holding on
And they stand for your feet (just remember)
Family comes first Don't you be ashamed of your family, put you into this earth,
And that's what its worth unconditionally, sometimes you may
Disagree and wont see eye to eye
Don't you run away they will be right by your side
Oh oh Where you gonna run to? when no one is around
Do you think how dare they will love you.
When your face is on the ground? (face is on the ground),
When you feel your strength is almost gone
And When your heart is getting weak (getting weak)
And you don't think you can keep holding on
And they stand for your feet (just remember)
Family comes first
Yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah)
Comes first Friday night you and your boys went out to eat
Then they hung out, but you came home around three
If six of y'all went out
Then four of you were really cheap
'Cause only two of you had dinner
I found your credit card receipt It's not right but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
And don't you dare come running back to me It's not right but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy I pack your bags so you can leave town for a week (yes I am)
The phone rings and then you look at me (Why'd you turn and look at me)
You said it was one of your friends, down on 54th Street (boy)
So why did 213 show up on your caller ID I've been through all this before
So how could you think
That I would stand around and take some more
Things are gonna change
'Cause I won't be your fool anymore
That's why you have to leave
So don't turn around to see my face
There's no more tears left here for you to see Was it really worth you going out like that
See I'm moving on and I refuse to turn back
See all of this time I thought I had somebody down for Whitney
It turns out, you were making a fool of me It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
And don't you dare come running back to me It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
And don't you dare come running back to me It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
And don't you dare come running back to me It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
And don't you dare come running back to me It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave How could I throw away a miracle
How could I face another day
It's all of my doing
I made a choice
And today I pay
My heart is full of pain
How could you understand
The way I feel
How could you relate to so much pain
Seems as though nothing can comfort me
So today I pray
That someone should listen for [Chorus]
Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
The choice is yours
There's a miracle in store
Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
A voice of love is crying out
Don't throw love away
There's a miracle in store How could I let go of a miracle
Nothing could ever take its place
Thought I was looking
Out for myself
Now it seems the pain
Is all that I have gained
I wonder if I could be your miracle
I wonder if I could spare you pain
Seems as though nothing will comfort me
Less today I pray
That you should come listen [Chorus] Don't ever throw away your miracle
Don't let it slip away
Nothing should matter [Chorus] Whatever you want, whatever you need
Anything you want done, baby
I'll do it naturally
'Cause I'm every woman (every woman)
It's all in me, it's all in me, yeah! I'm every woman, it's all in me
Anything you want done, baby, I'll do it naturally I'm every woman, it's all in me

Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa I can sense your needs

I'm every woman, I'm every woman Where do I go when there's nobody else to turn to?
Who do I talk to when nobody wants to listen?
Who do I lean on when there's no foundation stable? I go to the rock
I know he's able
I go to the rock I go to the rock for my salvation
I go to the stone that the builders rejected
I run to the mountain and the mountain stands by me When the Earth all around me is sinking sand
On Christ, the solid rock I stand
When I need a shelter, when I need a friend
I go to the rock Where do I go, where do I go
When the storms of life are threatening?
Who do I turn to when those winds of sorrow blow?
And is there a refuge in the time of tribulation? I go to the rock
I know He's able
I go to the rock I know He's the rock for my salvation
I know He's the stone that the builders rejected
I run to the mountain and the mountain stands by me When the Earth all around me is sinking sand
On Christ, the solid rock I stand
When I need a shelter, when I need a friend
I go to the rock I know He's the rock for my salvation
I know He's the stone that the builders rejected
I run to the mountain and the mountain stands by me When the Earth all around me is sinking sand
On Christ, the solid rock I stand
When I need a shelter, when I need a friend
I go to the rock I go to the rock

I get so emotional, baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional, baby Well there's a bridge and there's a river that I still must cross
As I'm going on my journey
Oh, I might be lost And there's a road I have to follow, a place I have to go
Well no-one told me just how to get there
But when I get there I'll know
'Cause I'm taking it Step by step, bit by bit,
Stone by stone (yeah), brick by brick (oh, yeah)
Step by step, day by day, mile by mile (ooh, ooh, ooh) And this old road is rough and ruined
So many dangers along the way
So many burdens might fall upon me
So many troubles that I have to face Oh, but I won't let my spirit fail me
Oh, I won't let my spirit go
Until I get to my destination
I'm gonna take it slowly 'cause I'm making it mine Step by step, bit by bit,
Stone by stone (yeah), brick by brick (oh, yeah)

This is the heartbreak hotel You said you'd be here by nine
Instead you took your time
You didn't think to call me boy
Here I sit trying not to cry
Asking myself why
You'd do this to me Since you're not around for me to tell you baby, face to face
I'm writing you this letter, and this is what I have to say: All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead you told me lies
When someone else was on your mind
What you do to me
Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What you do to me
Can't take what you did to me Now I see that you've been doing wrong
You played me all along
And made a fool of me, baby
You got it all wrong to think that I wouldn't find out
That you were cheating on me
How could you do it to me Since you're not around for me to tell you baby, face to face
I'm writing you this letter, and this is what I have to say: All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead you told me lies
When someone else was on your mind
What you do to me
Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What you do to me
Can't take what you did to me Heartbreak hotel

I ain't gonna take it no more
I ain't gonna take it no more Everything that you said was a lie
Don't lie to me
Tell me what it is and I will be alright Guide me, O thou great Jehovah, Pilgrim thro'
this barren land; I am weak, but though art
mighty, Hold me with Thy powerful hand: Bread of
Heaven, Feed me till I want no more; Bread of
Heaven, feed me till I want no more. Open now the crystal fountain Whence the healing
streams do flow; Let the fiery, cloudy cloudy pillar
Lead me all my journey thro': Strong Deliverer,
Be thou still my strength and shield; Strong
Deliverer be thou my strength and sheild. When I tread the verge of Jordan, Bid my anxious
fears subside; Bear me thro' the swelling
current, Land me safe on Canaan's side: Songs of
praises I will ever give to Thee; Songs of
praises I will ever give to Thee. I found out what I've been missing
Always on the run
I've been looking for someone Now you're here like you've been before

It took some time for me to see That you give good love to me baby
So good take this heart of mine into your hands

Thank you for being woman enough to come
(Whitney, what's this about?) I know he's leaving me for you
(Who said that, who told you?)
That is true
What is he telling you?
Could it be the same things that he told me?
(He told me that he loved me)
I heard that
(He told me I was beautiful)
Uh-huh
(How did you know? How did you know?)
Because I played the scene before [Whitney]
This is a retake of my life
I was his star for many nights
Now the roles have changed
And you're the leading lady in his life
Lights, camera, now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now cause it won't last
Same script, different cast [Deborah](Whitney)
What you're saying could be true
But how can I take advice from you?
(I'm not hating)
(But I wish the one before me would have warned me too babe)
Don't say no more, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
(Uncover your ears, girl)

And you're the leading lady in his life
Lights, camera, now you're on
Just remember you've been warned

Same script, different cast [Deborah](Whitney)
It's your fault you didn't love him enough
(That's the problem, I loved him too much)
(And when you love him he becomes unattracted to you)
Oh no, he's changed and I'll prove you wrong
(No, you won't)
So go away leave us the hell alone
See, he loves me
(He'll hurt you)
He'll stay with me
(He'll leave you)
For sure, for sure, oh [Whitney]
This is a retake of my life
I was his star for many nights
Now the roles have changed
Now, now, now, now, now, no, no
Now the roles have changed
Have changed, and I'm the leading lady in his life.

You were his star for many nights
But now the roles have changed
I'm the leading lady in his life
Lights, camera, now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now, cause this will last
I'm the future, you're his past [Both]

Lights, camera, now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now
Enjoy this now

I know it will last
Same script, different cast, oh So many nights I sit by my window
Waiting for someone to sing me his song
So many dreams I kept deep inside me
Alone in the dark but now
You've come along And you light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song Rollin' at sea, adrift on the water
Could it be finally I'm turning for home?
Finally, a chance to say hey,
I love you
Never again to be all alone 'Cause you
You light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song And you
You light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song
With song
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song It can't be wrong
When it feels so right
'Cause you
You light up my life, my life, my life, my life oooh Listen to the music
The sound of the angels
Come and see the child
Who can make you whole
Lying in a manger
Away from harm and danger [Chorus]
Oh joy in my soul
Oh joy, joy down in my soul
Sweet beautiful soul saving joy
Oh joy, joy, joy in my soul
Joy, joy, joy in my soul oh He sent from up above
This special gift of love
More precious than silver or gold
He was sent this holiday
To take our pain away [Chorus] Go tell it on the mountain
Shout it from a valley
Tell about the baby in swaddling clothes
Men in every nation
Join the celebration Way down deep joy
Joy, joy, joy
I've got joy
Way down deep inside my soul joy
Unspeakable joy
Joy in my soul On the day that you left me
You said you had no regrets
There's a bond between us
That hasn't been broken yet
And the feelings between us
Will never disappear
How can you be far away
When your spirit's here [Chorus]
You're still my man
Nothing can change it
We still belong together
You're still my man
Nothing can change it
Our love will last forever And the seasons of our love
Will always change I know
Maybe that's the reason
You felt we had to go
But soon you'll be missing me
Darling I know you well
There's a magic we share together
And no one can break that spell [Chorus] I'll wait for you
The thought that keeps me going each day
Is I believe you still love me
I love you more than words can say [Chorus] You're still my man
Nothing's gonna change it
Don't you know, you oughta know we belong together
You're still my man
And nothing can change it

But that was all before he came
I thought love had to hurt to turn out right
But now he's here
It's not the same, it's not the same He fills me up
He gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I've got
He's all I've got in this world
But he's all the man that I need And in the morning when I kiss his eyes
He takes me down and rocks me slow
And in the evening when the moon is high
He holds me close and won't let go
He won't let go He fills me up
He gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I've got
He's all I've got in this world
But he's all the man that I need He fills me up
He gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I've got
He's all I've got in this world
But he's all the man that I need He fills me up
He gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
He's all I've got
He's all I've got in this world
But he's all the man that I need Over and over, I look in your eyes
You were all I desire
You have captured me
I want to hold you
I want to be close to you
I never want to let go I wish that this night would never end
I need to know Could I hold you for a lifetime?
Could I look into your eyes?
Could I have this night to share this night together?
Could I hold you close beside me?
Could I hold you for all time?
Could I, could I have this kiss forever?
Could I (could I), could I have this kiss forever? (forever, forever, forever) Over and over I've dreamed of this night

Could I have this kiss forever? Did you really think that
I would really take you back
Let you back in my heart
One more time, oh, no no Did you think I'd still care
That there'd be more feeling there
Did you think you could walk back
In my life, oh So you found you missed the love you threw away
Baby, but you found it out too late, too late And so you know the way it feels to cry
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
And baby I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best, I learned from you
Oh baby, now, I learned from you I remember cold nights
Tears I thought would never dry
How you shattered my world
With your goodbye, your goodbye Would a sold my soul then
Just to have you back again
Now you are the last thing on my mind Now you say you're sorry and you've
Changed your ways
Sorry but you changed your ways too late And so you know the way it feels to cry
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
And baby I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best, I learned from you
Oh baby, now, I learned from you So when all you've got are sleepless night
When those tears are clouding up your eyes
Just remember it was you
Who said goodbye, who said goodbye And so you know the way it feels to cry
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
And baby I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best, I learned from you
Oh baby, now, I learned from you I learned from the best
I learned from you I've got the stuff that you want
I've got the thing that you need
I've got more than enough
To make you drop to your knees
'Cause I'm the queen of the night
The queen of the night
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah Don't make no difference if I'm wrong or I'm right
I've got the feeling and I'm willing tonight
Well I ain't nobody's angel
What can I say, I'm just that way I've got the stuff that you want
I've got the thing that you need
I've got more than enough
To make you drop to your knees
'Cause I'm the queen of the night
The queen of the night
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah 'Cause I'm the queen of the night
The queen of the night
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah You've got a problem with the way that I am
They say I'm trouble and I don't give a damn
But when I'm bad I know I'm better
I just want to get you, and turn it up for you I've got the stuff that you want
I've got the thing that you need
I've got more than enough
To make you drop to your knees
'Cause I'm the queen of the night
The queen of the night
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah 'Cause I'm the queen of the night
The queen of the night
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah Now tell me how you'd feel
If I told you that I
Have feelings for you
And would it be so wrong to say
What's on my mind
I'm sorry I have to
We were friends but with time
What I feel inside for you has changed
But I'd give up on love
If I thought that it was untrue for you If I told you that
I wanted to see you
And if I told you that
I'd beg to please you
If I told you that
I'll always keep you
What would you say
If I told you that I know that we're just friends
But what if I decide to bring something in
I hope it won't offend the trust
We have cause I don't want this to end
If you think that we'll lose what we have
Then I'd just rather stay (rather stay) the same
(I'd rather stay the same)
'Cause I don't want to choose
Between two of the most precious things to me
(Tell me) If I told you that
I wanted to see you
And if I told you that
I'd beg to please you
If I told you that
I'll always keep you
What would you say
If I told you that If we take this chance
And extend to each other romance
I hope it would be
The right thing for you and me If I told you that
I wanted to see you
And if I told you that
I'd beg to please you
If I told you that
I'll always keep you
What would you say
If I told you that Would you be there for me
Could you dare to hold me
Will my feelings leave me
Lonely if I told you If I told you that
I wanted to see you
And if I told you that
I'd beg to please you
If I told you that
I'll always keep you
What would you say
If I told you that I saw the news this morning
And saw your face across the screen
And as I poured my coffee,
I picked up a magazine [Chorus]
But as I turned the page
And looked inside
There you were again (there you were)
Oh these lonely times
They never seem to end
You're too far
I know I should be there where you are Today I did some shopping
Just had to clear my mind again
I can't stop thinkin' bout you
I hopped into a taxi
In a moment I was home
Home again [Chorus] Tossing and turning in my sleep
I can't take being without you
I'm gonna catch the next plane out
I got to get to where you are
No matter how near or far
I got to get there where you are
I know [Chorus] I want to be where you are
I need to be where you are
I want to be I want to be baby
You know I need to be
I know I should be there where you are Everyone falls in love sometimes
Sometimes it's wrong, and sometimes it's right
For every win, someone must fail
But there comes a point when
When we exhale yeah, yeah, say Shoop, shoop, shoop shoop be doop,
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop (all you gotta do is say)
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop Sometimes you'll laugh, sometimes you'll cry
Life never tells us, the when's or why's
When you've got friends, to wish you well
You'll find your point when, you will exhale (yeah, yeah, say) Shoop, shoop, shoop shoop be doop,
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop Hearts are often broken
When there are words unspoken
In your soul there's answers to your prayers
If you're searching for a place you know
A familiar face, somewhere to go
You should look inside yourself
You're halfway there Sometimes you'll laugh, sometimes you'll cry
Life never tells us, the when's or why's
But when you've got friends, to wish you well
You'll find your point when
You will exhale (yeah, yeah, say) Shoop, shoop, shoop shoop be doop,
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop I hold you, I touch you
Make you my woman

With sweet surrender
Tonight our hearts will beat as one
And I'll hold you, I'll touch you

Should have seen it all along All those sweet (sweet) sweet kisses (yeah)
And those sweet (sweet) red roses (yeah)
They convinced me it was you

If ya told me from the start
That you played around, I woulda been fine
Then I woulda played too
And I guess I woulda had a good time Something didn't feel right

And you put me through it
Why would you bring me so much pain I would stick up for you
'Cause I did (I did adore you) adore you
While my dogs would chew you out
Tried to be so nice
On those lonely
(On those lonely lonely lonely nights) nights

After we make love
It's so good to be lost in the afterglow
All I'm dreaming of

I feel I've been touched by
All that heaven and earth will allow
All that matters is right here and now Now tell me how you'd feel
If I told you that I
Have feelings for you
And would it be so wrong to say
What's on my mind
I'm sorry I have to
We were friends but with time
What I feel inside for you has changed
But I'd give up on love
If I thought that it was untrue for you If I told you that
I wanted to see you
And if I told you that
I'd beg to please you
If I told you that
I'll always keep you
What would you say
If I told you that I know that we're just friends
But what if I decide to bring something in
I hope it won't offend the trust
We have cause I don't want this to end
If you think that we'll lose what we have
Then I'd just rather stay (rather stay) the same
(I'd rather stay the same)
'Cause I don't want to choose
Between two of the most precious things to me
(Tell me) If I told you that
I wanted to see you
And if I told you that
I'd beg to please you
If I told you that
I'll always keep you
What would you say
If I told you that If we take this chance
And extend to each other romance
I hope it would be
The right thing for you and me If I told you that
I wanted to see you
And if I told you that
I'd beg to please you
If I told you that
I'll always keep you
What would you say
If I told you that Would you be there for me
Could you dare to hold me
Will my feelings leave me
Lonely if I told you If I told you that
I wanted to see you
And if I told you that
I'd beg to please you
If I told you that
I'll always keep you
What would you say
If I told you that Why does it hurt so bad
Why do I feel so sad
Thought I was over you
But I keep crying
When I don't love you
So why does it hurt so bad
I thought I had let you go
So why does it hurt me so
I gotta get you outta my head
It hurts so bad
Oh it hurts so bad baby My life's been better
Since the day I left you boy
I must admit life's been kind to me
I went and did the things I said I would boy
I found someone who loves me for me
Haven't had much drama since the day that we split boy
My heart's never been more at ease
And when I think of all the things you put me through
Leaving you has been the best thing for me So why does it hurt so bad
Why do I feel so sad
I thought I was over you
But I keep crying
When I don't love you
So why does it hurt so bad
Baby I thought I had let you go
So why does it hurt me so
I gotta get you outta my head
Hurts me so bad
Hurts so (yeah you do)
Hurts so (hurts me so)
Hurts so bad (did you know)
Hurts so (that it hurts me so)
Hurts so (so bad, hey hoh) "Never again" that's what I said to myself
I never want to feel kind of pain again boy
Just when I think it's over
Just when I think it's through
I find myself right back in love with you So why does it hurt so bad oh baby
Why do I feel so sad
(thought I thought I) Thought I was over you
I keep crying
When I don't love you (when I really don't love you boy)
(oh no oh no oh no oh no it hurts so bad, oh tell me)
So why does it hurt so bad

You could
Gotta get you outta my head
Boy you hurt me so bad

Hurts so (make me want to make me want to shoop shoop)
Hurts so bad (hurt me so, gotta shoop now)
Hurts so bad (Hurts me so)
Oh why, you hurt me so bad
Bad (how 'bout that?) When your love is strong and it comes from the heart
Ain't no man strong enough ain't no time long enough to tear it apart
And that's what we had believe it or not
So on the final day I thought all the hurting pain will end up on top So I won't cry 'cause you're going away
'Cause the chemistry we've got it don't fade
I won't be wishing for better days
'Cause deep inside I know our love stays the same You got to know [Chorus]
No matter where you are (you got me)
Baby near or far (you got me)
Our love will never fade (you got me)
So let me hear you say it
Baby I got you... I'll be there I'll be there (no matter what)
Baby I got you... I'll be there I'll be there (no matter what)
'Cause I got you baby I never lie
'Cause you are the reason that my heart is beating that I am alive
Before you go... look in my eyes
You can't be replaced (no)
I'm down to wait... The rest of my life You got to know [Chorus] I'll hold you up... when you just can't stand
I'll make you fly... when you think that you can't
By my side forever... baby that's the plan
I'll be your everything... I'll be your everything I got you... [Chorus] Say you want me I want you baby
Say you love me I need you baby
I got you baby you got me
I'll be there for you
I love you baby I love you darling Say you will be there... Sometimes life can make you crazy
It can really put a body to the test
You try so hard to make sure everything is right
And you find you've only wound up with a mess It's a common situation
Even though you feel abandoned and alone
Child, you ain't the first to experience a hurt so
Don't panic when you bit the danger zone What you need's a little change of heart
Forget this fear and frustration
Love will always play the greater part
When you battles wear you down
Here's my advice When you're feeling down and out
And you're got troubles on your mind
Love will save the day
When you're feeling full of doubt
And fear has got you in a bind
Love will save the day When your world's falling apart
All you got to do is say a prayer
And love will save the day
There's answer in your heart
So let your light shines, my dear
And love will save the day
Love will save the day
Love will save the day
Love will save the day
Love will save the day
Love will save the day Many things in this world bring you down
It's a wonder you can make it through the day
Well you can't sleep cause your problems are too deep
And there's always something getting the way And when you turn on the evening news
Mass confusion is the only thing you'll see
Well there's no question
That we need a new direction cause
We all could use dome peace and harmony What you need's a little change of heart
Forget this fear and frustration
Love will always play the greater part
When you battles wear you down
Here's my advice When you're feeling down and out
And you're got troubles on your mind
Love will save the day
When you're feeling full of doubt
And fear has got you in a bind
Love will save the day Many nights we prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hope for a song
We barely understood Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains
Long before we knew we could, whoa, yes There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
Its hard to kill Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe somehow you will
You will when you believe (Mmmmmmmmmyeah)
Mmmyeah
In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain Hope seems like the summer bird
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My hearts so full, I can't explain Seeking faith and speakin' words
I never thought I'd say
There can be miracles
When you believe (When you believe) Though hope is frail
Its hard to kill (Mmm)
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (You can achieve) When you believe somehow you will
You will when you believe
(Hey)
(Ooh) They don't always happen when you ask
And its easy to give in to your fears
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see the way, get through the rain A small but still, resilient voice
Says hope is very near, oh (Oh)
There can be miracles (Miracles)
When you believe (Boy, when you believe, yeah) (Though hope is frail) Though hope is frail (Its hard)
Its hard to kill (Hard to kill, oh, yeah)
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve (You can achieve, oh) When you believe somehow you will (Somehow, somehow, somehow)
Somehow you will (I know, I know, know)
You will when you believe (When you)
(Oh oh) (You will when you)
(You will when you believe)
(Ohoohooh)
(Oh, oh) (When you believe)
(When you believe) Till you get it right, tell 'em you will never quit
Tell 'em you will never quit until they day you get it right,
Till you get it right, hold your hand to the sky
Look 'em right in the eye, tell 'em you will never quit
Until the day you get it right
Till you get it right
Tell 'em you will never quit, until the day you get it right
Till you get it right, hold your hand to the sky
Look 'em right in the eye, tell 'em you will never quit
Until the day you get it right Single mother, two jobs, workin' her fingers to the bone
Putting her daughters mouth before her own
She's gotta do it, but she's still feeling
Like there's something deep inside that she can't leave behind She won't let go of it, no matter how many times
She hears it over with, it's all fixed in her mind
That it's gonna get better and she won't ever
Hang her head again, break a sweat again, never again [Chorus]
Never, never give up, never, never give up,
No matter how many times, somebody tells you it ain't working
Never, never give up, never, never give up,
Hold your head tot he sky, look them right in the eyes
Tell you will never quit until the day you get it right
Never, never give up, never, never give up,
Even though some days you'll have to cry,
Shake it off and know that everything will be alright
As long as you never, never give up, never, never give up. College student, paying her own way,
Working the club at night
Look what she go through, to stay in law school
So maybe one day, she can make her way in a man's world
And never be called just another girl It ain't nothing like a dream you can't see
Even when the people round you don't believe
But in the twelfth round, when you're against the ropes,
Here comes your last minute miracle,
You've got to know to [Chorus] The sky is the limit, for whatever you want to do
Don't let anyone tell you, it ain't possible
No matter how low you feel, keep going higher, higher
See I've been holding on, to my dreams too long
To watch it get away from me,
This hand is mine to win, and I promise you that
I'll never, never give up [Chorus: x2] Oh oh oh yeah
Oh oh oh oh oh Came in the door
Checked in my coat
And who I'm looking for
Is staring in my face They played our song
We hit the floor
He held me strong
And we danced the night away I can see the way that he is making feel
This way about his love
I've been looking for something like this
I'm saying ooh oh oh oh ooh oh oh! If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Say oh oh oh, say oh oh oh!
If you go left right up down
Make you spinning round and round
Say ooh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh! It's been a long long time
Since I fell, fell
Love has found my way oh oh oh
I've been looking (looking)
I've been searching (searching)
For the man to touch this place, oh ooh oh yeah Can't deny the way that he is making feel
This way about his love
I've been searching for something like this
I'm saying oh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh! If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Say oh oh oh, say oh oh oh!
Makes you go left right up down
Makes you spinning round and round
Say oh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh! If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Say oh oh oh, say oh oh oh!
Makes you go left right up down
Makes you spinning round and round
Say oh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh! If you feel good
If you're feeling good
Put one hand in the air, say yeah
If you feel good
If you're feeling good
It's 'cause love is in the air
Love is in the air If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Say oh oh oh, say oh oh oh!
Makes you go left right up down
Makes you spinning round and round
Say ooh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh! If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Say oh oh oh, say oh oh oh!
Makes you go left right up down
Makes you spinning round and round
Say ooh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh! Come on and say... Come on and say... Like a candle
Burning bright
Love is glowing in your eyes
A flame to light our way
That burns brighter everyday
But now I have you
Nobody loves me like you do Like a leaf
Upon the wind
I could find a place to land
I dream the hours away
And wonder everyday
Do dreams come true
Nobody loves me like you do [Chorus]
What if I never met you
Where would I be right now
Funny how life just falls in place somehow
Oh you touched my heart in places
That I never even knew
'Cause nobody loves me like you do Mm I was words without a tune
I was a song still unsung
Poem with no rhyme
A dancer out of time
But now there's you
Nobody loves me like you do [Chorus] Nobody loves me
Nobody loves me like you do
Nobody loves me like you do Akon and Whitney, yeah Oh, yeah
(Oh, yeah) Did you ever wish
(Wish)
You could get
Back something
(Uh, huh)
That you did in your past
(Yeah) If it wasn't for me
I know what we had
Would definitely gonna last I admit
(Admit)
That we say some things
(Uh, huh)
We don't mean
When we're mad
(Yeah) But I realize
(Yeah)
That I've been foolish
I never should have
(Yeah)
Turned my back 'Cause it's
A cold world
When you
Are out there
(Uh huh)
All alone
(All alone) So many times
That I wanted to just
Pick up the phone
(Up the phone) And tell you
Ooh, baby
Baby

Back no more
(Yeah) Your girl
Is coming home
(Yeah) And I want you
To love me
Like I never left

To hold me
Like I never left
And I want you
To touch me
Like I never left
Come give me
What I'm missing
Like I never left
(Yeah, yeah) Do you think
(Think)
We could pick up
(Uh, huh)
Where we left off
Before the day
(The day, yeah) That I told you
It was over
Packed my things
And moved away
(Moved away) 'Cause I see
(See)
That without you
(Uh, huh)
My world is just
An empty place
(Place) Taking one step away
(Yeah)
From you feels
Like a million miles away
(Yeah) 'Cause it's
A cold world
When you
Are out there
(Uh, huh)
All alone
(All alone) So many times
I wanted to just
Pick up the phone
(Up the phone) And tell you
Ooh, baby
Baby
I miss your love
And so But I ain't holding
Back no more
(No) 'Cause your man
Is coming home

I never left you, baby Oh, baby
Come love me
Come hold me
Come touch me Come give me
Like I never left
I never left you, baby We've been playing games with our emotions
Let's get what we feel out in the open
Wanting you is all I do
Boy I know you want me too
Don't you think it's time we proved
What we've been feeling [Chorus]
This is our moment of truth
Either we win or we lose this love
It's just the way that we feel
We'll know if love is for real, soon enough
Let out your feelings tonight
Cause oh, I know that I want you
It's all up to me and you
And the moment of truth Far too many times a heart gets broken
Just because three words are never spoken
We can't let that bother us
Not when we're so much in love
I could never get enough of saying I love you [Chorus] Wanting you is all I do
Boy, I know you want me, too
Don't you think it's time we proved
What we've been feeling [Chorus] Nothing is so good it lasts eternally
Perfect situations must go wrong
But this has never yet prevented me
From wanting far too much for far too long
Looking back, I could have done it differently
Won a few more moments, who can tell?
But it took time to understand the man
Now at least I know, I know him well Wasn't it good, Wasn't it fine
Isn't it madness he can't be mine
But in the end, he needs a little more than before
Security, he needs his fantasy and freedom
I know him so well No one in your life is with you constantly
No one is completely on your side
And though I move my world to be with him
Still the gap between us is too wide
Looking back, I could have played it differently
Learned about the man before I fell
But I was ever so much younger then Wasn't it good (oh so good), Wasn't it fine (so fine)
Isn't it madness he can't be mine Didn't I know how it would go
If I knew from the start
Why am I falling apart Wasn't it fine
Isn't it madness he can't be mine
But in the end, he needs a little more than before
Security, he needs his fantasy and freedom
I know him so well
It took some to understand him
Hoo ooh I know him so well (Clap your hands y'all, it's alright...) If tomorrow is judgment day (Sing Mommy)
And I'm standing on the front line
And the Lord asks me what I did with my life
I will say I spent it with you If I wake up in World War III
I see destruction and poverty
And I feel like I want to go home
It's okay if you're coming with me 'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us If I lose my fame and fortune
And I'm homeless on the street
And I'm sleeping in Grand Central Station
It's okay if you're sleeping with me As the years they pass us by
We stay young through each other's eyes
And no matter how old we get
It's okay as long as I got you baby 'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us If I should die this very day
Don't cry, 'cause on Earth we weren't meant to stay
And no matter what the people say
I'll be waiting for you after the judgment day 'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us If there's a time
When the tears should fill your eyes
And you can't see past the shadows
To the sun on the other side
Don't despair
Because there always will be someone there
Don't lose faith
Love won't let you lose your way, because you You'll never stand alone
I'll be standing by
I'll keep you from the cold
I'll hold you when you cry
I'll be there to be strong
When you can't find the strength inside
And you, you'll always have a home
In these arms of mine
And you'll never stand alone
Love is standing by Oh yes it is, yes
If there's a day when the rain should find your heart
And you're cold and tired and lonely
And this world has you in the dark
Don't be scared
You can just reach for me
And I'll be there
Don't lose hope
Love will see you through you know
I'll be, 'cause you You'll never stand alone
I'll be standing by
I'll keep you from the cold
I'll hold you when you cry
I'll be there to be strong
When you can't find the strength inside
And you, you'll always have a home
In these arms of mine
And you'll never stand alone
Love is standing by Standing by to life you above
All the hurt and pain, oh yeah
Standing by to carry you through
All the tears and rain
Oh reach for me
(I'll be there for you)
Reach for me babe, yeah
(I'll see you through)
See I'll be the one to hold you
The one to show you that you You'll never stand alone
I'll be standing by
I'll keep you from the cold
I'll hold you when you cry
I'll be there to be strong
When you can't find the strength inside
And you, you'll always have a home
In these arms of mine
And you'll never stand alone
Love is standing by You'll never stand alone
I'll be standing by
I'll keep you from the cold
I'll hold you when you cry
I'll be there to be strong
When you can't find the strength inside
And you, you'll always have a home
In these arms of mine
And you'll never stand alone
Love is standing by Oh, love is standing by Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up to now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls, loneliness calls Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me Somebody oo Somebody oo
Somebody who loves me yeah

To hold me in his arms oh

On a love that burns hot enough to last

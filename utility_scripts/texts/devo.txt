Why she left this 3D world behind
Go! She got tired of the same old story
She had a mind that would not quit
She'd insist a plot must exist
With an ending that she could not guess She tried hard to convince me
Then she took off like a bright idea
She believed there just had to be
A movie that she'd never seen I watched as her fingers drew
A perfect line in space
I watched as she looked on through
Into another place She found out what she'd been missing
She decided she could change her luck
She was right, life's not black and white
It's something more than meets the eye I watched as her fingers drew
A perfect line in space
I watched as she walked straight through
Into another place She parted with convention
Now she's living in the 4th dimension
Without me I watched as her fingers drew
A perfect line in space
I watched as she walked straight through
Into another place I tried and tried and still I don't know why
She left me no address or a way to guess

Ain't it true? There's just no more doubt
Maybe some things that you can't do without
And that's good
Everybody's just like you, it's true
Everybody wants a good thing too
Now let's have a great big hand
For everybody who can understand
Life's a bee without a buzz
It's going great till you get stung
And let us not forget to toast
Everyone who might have missed the boat
And to everybody else who waits
'Til the next one sails in again
Everybody, it's a good thing
Ain't it true? It's a monumental good thing
Everybody, it's a good thing
Ain't it true? It's a monumental good thing
Everybody, it's a good thing
Ain't it true? It's a monumental good thing Girl of my dreams, she don't love me
Always the way it seems to be

The waves of nauseous pain
Sets off the pressure pad alarms

Nobody ever said that life was free
Sank, swam, go down with the ship
But use your freedom of choice I'll say it again in the land of the free
Use your freedom of choice
Your freedom of choice In ancient Rome there was a poem
About a dog who found two bones
He picked at one, he licked the other
He went in circles, he dropped dead Freedom of choice
Is what you got
Freedom of choice Then if you got it you don't want it
Seems to be the rule of thumb
Don't be tricked by what you see
You got two ways to go I'll say it again in the land of the free
Use your freedom of choice
Freedom of choice Freedom of choice
Is what you got
Freedom of choice In ancient Rome there was a poem
About a dog who found two bones
He picked at one, he licked the other
He went in circles, he dropped dead Freedom of choice
Is what you got
Freedom from choice
Is what you want Freedom of choice
Is what you got
Freedom from choice
Is what you want Freedom of choice

Then you turn around
Take a look at who you are
It's pretty scary You're so silly
Well, it's revolting
You're not much
If you're anything Take a step outside the city
And you turn around
Take a look at what you are
Well, it's revolting You're really nowhere
You're so wasteful
So foolish
No big deal Who said, don't look back
Don't believe 'em
You go for that corner seat in the restaurant
'Cause they're gonna try and get behind you Don't you let 'em do it
You know what I'm talkin' about?
You hear me talkin'? It's pretty scary
It's so revolting
It's pretty scary
It's so revolting It's pretty scary
It's so revolting
It's pretty scary
It's so revolting Take a step outside the country
Then you turn around
Take a look at where you are
Well, it's amazing Take a good look
You're no big deal
You're so petty
It's a laugh Take a step outside the planet
You turn around and round
Now take a look at where you are
It's pretty scary every move I make
every rule I break
makes me want it more
every step I take
every new mistake
each revolving door
keeps me searching for you
there's nowhere for you to hide
'cause a feelin's got me reelin'
and I'm twisted up inside don't you know I got a thing that looks for you
don't you know the way you make me feel about you
don't you know I got a place that waits for you
don't you know that I am always thinking of you I got a rocket in my pocket
but I don't know what to do
like a plug without a socket
I'm just waitin' 'round for you don't you know I got a thing for you to do
don't you know the way you make me feel about you
don't you know I got a thing that looks for you
don't you know that I am always thinking of you I got a rocket in my pocket
I don't know what to do
like a plug without a socket
I'm just waitin' 'round for you twist away the gates of steel
unlock the secret voice
give in to ancient noise
take a chance a brand new dance
twist away the gates of steel twist away
now twist and shout
the earth it moves too slow
but the earth is all we know
we pay to play the human way
twist away the gates of steel a man is real
not made of steel! but the earth is all we know
we pay to play the human way
twist away the gates of steel the beginning was the end
of everything now
the ape regards his tail
he's stuck on it
repeats until he fails
half a goon and half a god
a man's not made of steel twist away
now twist and shout
the earth it moves too slow
but the earth is all we know
we pay to play the human way
twist away the gates of steel a man is real
that's how he feels! I know I let you tell me what to do
You were confident you knew best
Now things aren't working like you want them to
Your confidence is what I detest You got me lookin' up high
You got me searchin' down low
You got me I know you know
You got me jerkin' back 'n' forth You told me, people like to suffer
You told me that's the way it is
You said that things were getting better
You said I should accept all this You think it's funny
But what I say is true
The reason that I live like this
Is all because of you You got me lookin' up high
You got me searchin' down low
You got me, I know you know
You got me jerkin' back 'n' forth There is a thought that keeps me thinking
Like a stone inside my shoe
It is a vision reoccurring
A dirty window I can see you through You think it's funny
But what I say is true
The reason that I live like this
Is all because of you You got me lookin' up high
You got me searchin' down low

Patterns of behavior, sometimes seem unfair
Can you recognize the patterns that you find? Patterns unfamiliar, patterns lead you through
To patterns of discovery tracing out the clues

You can rearrange the patterns so unkind
Don't bother asking why a pattern never cries
Old patterns never die, they just go on and on Patterns multiplying, re-direct our view
Endless variations make it all seem new

I'd wake up my neighbors
Pounding out a rhythm
All about you
If I had a pencil
I'd push me some paper
I'd build a skyscraper
To get close to you
If I had a lasso
I'd sail out the window
And land on an island
Next to you
If I had a hot rod
I'd fasten up my seatbelt
And break the speed limit
Gettin' to you
But I ain't got a hammer
And I ain't got a pencil
And I ain't got a lasso
So I'm doing it the hard way
Like a post post-modern man
If I had a credit card
I'd clear me a pathway
Through the deepest jungle
Right to your door
If I had a camera
I'd snap away my fingers
And collect up the pictures
Of you of course
But I ain't got a hot rod
And I ain't got a credit card
No chance for a camera
So I'm doing it the hard way
Like a post post-modern man
Well I ain't got a hammer
And I ain't got a lasso
No chance for a camera
So I'm doing it the hard way I saw my baby yesterday
I saw my baby yesterday
She spent her money on a car
She spent her money on a brand new car I didn't get her very far
You know it din't go very far
So my baby said to me
You know my baby said to me You know my baby she said, "Sloppy"
She said, "Sloppy", She said, "Sloppy"
I think I missed the hole, hole, hole She said, "Sloppy", She said, "Sloppy", She said, "Sloppy"
I think I missed the hole, hole, hole I saw my baby yesterday

I think I missed the hole, hole, hole She tries on dresses half her size
She whines, "These labels all tell lies"
She wiggles 'til you give her love
Then says, "I'm jumping off your bus" Love is mind games
Love is mind games She complains, you listen nice
Then gets P. O.'d by your advice
She waits until it's time for bed
To question what's inside your head If you think
Black is black
And white is white
Open up your eyes
And get it right Love is mind games
Love is mind games
Love is mind games
Love is mind games If you think the chemistry that makes you stupid
Is the same as the stuff that makes you smart
All I can say to you, my friend
Is that you're off to a banging start Playing mind games
Playing mind games I try and I try hard to believe
A guy and girl can live in peace
I get laughs when I explain
We could escape the house of pain If you think the sky is blue
Or the grass is green
Open up your eyes
See what I mean Love is mind games
Love is mind games
Love is mind games
Love is mind games You know I live a life of danger
For the FBI
Keeping tabs on our nation
On the land, on the sea, in the sky
But every single night
Before I go to bed
I get down on my knees
And thank God
I'm a secret agent man
Secret agent man
Secret agent
Secret agent man
They've given me a number
But they've taken 'way my name
I got one hell of a job to perform
For the U. S. of A.
Got the responsibility
Of our nation's top security
But every night and day
I salute the flag and say
Thank you Jesus
Cause I'm, I'm a secret agent man You know they got me doin' this
Doin' that
And a little bit of something else
Fighting cavities of evil
Safe-guarding America's health

You couldn't hear me, you walked on by
Something's changed, everything's rearranged
You didn't see me, you didn't answer I was invisible to your cause, I tried to tell you
I was your friend, you just kept walking like it was the end Let's talk, tell me all about it
Let's talk, what could it hurt now?
Let's talk, won't you tell me what is wrong, yeah?
Let's talk, we can work it out, somehow I saw you coming, you wore a wig
I wanted to laugh but you looked so serious
I say let's talk and you just walk
How was I to approach you? You really left no room Run out in the crowd if you really want to
But why not try for something new? MC yells, "I'm free"
Hey, dude
Coming through
As he mows 'em down In his truck
Pedal's stuck
To the floor
4 x 4
Burning oil by the ton I walked outside
It hit me on the dome
If you don't want trouble
You should stay at home In the day-glo sky
Above the devolved city
I looked up and saw
The banner big and bold Later is now
Sooner or later everybody gets it, right?
Later is now
Sooner or later everything comes to light
Later is now Lotta gold
On the phone
Dishing dirt
'til it hurts
Sends 'em all to hell Stalks her prey
Every day
Nasty blog
It's her job
Makin' trouble pays her well I walked outside
It hit me on the dome
If you don't want trouble
You should stay at home In the day-glo sky
Above the devolved city
I looked up and saw
The banner big and bold Later is now Tomorrow is a replay
So tonight I'll try to sleep
I'll deal with it later
I'll deal with it later
I'll deal with it later Later is now
Sooner or later everything comes to light
Later is now
Sooner or later everybody feels the bite Later is now
Sooner or later everybody gets it, right?
Later is now
Sooner or later everything comes to light Later is now
Later is now
Later is now
Later is now Chango!
Chango!
The bear (? )
I come up the river
Like beat man
I come up the river
Like skoke man fly
I come up the river
To kill many people
I come up the river
With laser gun
Dear uncle, dear uncle, dear uncle
Dear uncle, dear uncle
Your son just had intercourse
With baggy breast
Your son just had intercourse
With death debbie
My mommy didn't hold me when I was young
She didn't give me breast
And went insane
My mommy didn't hold me when I was young
She didn't give me breast
And went insane Auto modown
Down in Youngstown
Bodies in the street Auto mowdown
Noon in downtown
Bodies with no feet Auto mowdown
Down in Youngstown
Bodies got de'blues Auto mowdown
Noon in downtown
Bodies with no shoes An acid head goon
In a 55 Dodge
Didn't mean to do it But a sidewalk run
In the noonday sun
Ten to one, he had to lose it Wake up puppet boy! Get up puppet boy
You've got a job to do
Even so you're free to go
Where your master tells you to Listen puppet boy
Before you disobey
Consider that the strings attached
Could make a big change in your ways Puppet boy
It's the little things that count
Little problems little minds
Little points of view Puppet boy
It's the little things add up
Getting bigger pull the trigger
Little things like you Stand up puppet boy
Time to start the show
You'd better do some brand new moves
They paid a lot to watch you go No! What's that puppet boy?
Don't tell me what to do
What's that puppet boy?
I'm not a freak like you
What's that puppet boy?
I'll move when I want to

Could ever make you misbehave Puppet boy

Getting bigger pull the trigger
Little things like you Now wake up puppet boy! [Instrumental] I'm envious of your I.Q. of 37
You, you're the one
It's written all over your face
You, you're the one
I'd like to take your place I'm envious of your I.Q. of 37
Your lack of brains just drives me crazy
It's the only way to get by and be lazy
You, you're the one
It's written all over your face You, you're so dumb
I'd like to take your place
I'm envious of your I.Q. of 37
From where I come it's the dumber the better
No one likes a really go getter Something about the way you taste
Makes me want to clear my throat
There's a message to your movements
That really gets my goat I looked for sniffy linings
But you're rotten to the core
I've had just about all I can take
You know I can't take it no more I've got a gut feeling
I've got a gut feeling
I've got a gut feeling, feeling Centered 'round long time ago
On your ability to torment
Then you took your tongs of love
And stripped away my garment I looked for sniffy linings
But you're rotten to the core
I've had just about all I can take
You know I can't take it no more I've got a gut feeling
I've got a gut feeling
I've got a gut feeling, feeling I've got a gut feeling
I've got a gut feeling, feeling
I've got a gut feeling
I've got a gut feeling, feeling I've got a gut feeling
I've got a gut feeling, feeling
I've got a gut feeling
I've got a gut feeling, feeling I've got a gut feeling
I've got a gut feeling, feeling Slap your mammy down

All we ask is that you let us

i'm so stroft I am a human rocket
On a mission of deployment
I've been cocked and loaded
Ready for the culmination I am a human missile
Guided by a secret agenda
That commands my every thought and deed
And wills me on my way I am a human rocket
On a mission of redemption
I've been cocked and loaded
Primed by everything I know I am a human missile
Guided by a secret voice
That commands my every action
And wills me on my way There is no turning back
There are no second thoughts
First things first and all things fair
Be it love or war, they say There is no plan named B
On the land, in the air or on the sea
This is what's supposed to be
My duty now awaits me I am a human rocket
On a mission of instruction
I've been primed and programmed
Since the beginning of time I am a human missile
Guided by a secret master
That commands my every motion
And wills me on my way I've found my target
I've reached my co-ordinates
I'm set to detonate and resonate
The final poem I will create I've made a video
It tells a story, oh
I guess it's time to go
Don't forget to rewind I am a human rocket
On a mission of destruction
I've been locked and loaded
And ready for the confirmation I am a human missile
Guided by a secret perfection
That commands my full conviction
And wills me on my way Large parts of the experience
Will go by unnoticed, we are all
Distracted by the lights and sounds
Of everything and nothing Do you remember the breath you took
When they let you off the hook
And sent you swimming away
Back into your cell? I am a human rocket
On a mission of reduction
I've been cocked and loaded
Since the dawn of time I am a human missile
Guided by a secret voice
That commands my every thought and deed
And wills me on my righteous way When a man raises his hand
Am I correct to understand
He means Hello, Stay back or Danger
Watch out!
When a man extends his arm
Is it delight or to alarm
To signal Friend, Foe or stranger
And when he reaches for the sky
As we stare and wonder why
Does he reach to show the way
Or will he dive
Encoding signals is a major skill
It can lead to desires fullfilled
Or it can lead you to lose your very life
lose your very life Raise your hands
Raise your hands
Raise your hands I see the signals
The piston pumping
When a girl looks away
Does she really mean to say
Im feeling shy, about to cry
Or afraid (afraid, afraid)
And when she looks up towards the sky
And we're left to wonder why
Does she mean to say, Dont stay this is goodbye
Encoding signals means a great deal
It can explain the way that you feel
Or it can trace the shape
Of your very life
Of your very life Raise your hands
Raise your hands
Raise your hands The piston pumping
And middle fingers
Raise your hands
Raise your hands
Raise your hands
The Piston pumping and midde fingers Greetings beautiful mutants
And how may we be of service?
This is Nu-Tra for Devo incorporated
Checking in with the many factions Of devolutionary humans
Who have waited so faithfully this past year
While Devo gathered its strength
For the next offensive As many of you can see
The road ahead is filled with danger
It's not nuclear bombs we must fear
But the human mind itself Or lack of it on this planet
It's time to go beyond the normal thing
It's time to do the super thing
It's time for Devo There is no question about it
The spud boys are ready with
New songs, new films and new approaches
To survival, in a world filled with subhumans Lies, lies, lies
That's all we get
From those who pretend to know but don't
But once again Devo attempts To cut through the mental grease and grime
With techniques of positive mutation
Designed to protect you
From the ninnies and the twits Remember, no one knows
So let's find out, Devo asks the questions
That help point us all in the right direction
To go forward, move ahead And give the past the slip
It's time to seek out new traditions
We know where the old one's took us
And now we are all here together So let's go take in the full measure
Of Devo's new traditionalist spirit
The vinyl record and cassette tape
Of Devo's latest musical outpourings Is entitled simply 'New traditionalists'
To purchase, it is not like spending money
But rather, it is an investment in the future
In a blow against the empire This is Nu-Tra for Devo incorporated saying
'Bombs away' Well, I'm a huboon baby
I'm a cross between a human and an ape
I'm all decked out
I'm gonna hoot, I'm gonna root, I'm gonna rape People look at me
And laugh and make fun of my face
I laugh right back
I don't want to be part of the human race I did it to myself
Now somebody's gonna be sorry Well, I'm a huboon baby
Gonna mess around with all you fools
I'm all pumped up
I'm gonna romp, bone and stomp, I'm gonna rule I had the operation
Nothing else left to do
Well, lookit here, I've been hurt
Gonna hurt you Now, somebody's gonna be sorry
Like all you wankers and you slime
And you right-wing pinheads
Who make screwing a big crime You titty-twisted up my life
And pissed on all my dreams
You made me hate myself
Now come on, shoot me, set me free Let's go {Incomprehensible} I did it to myself
Now somebody's gonna be sorry Well, I'm a huboon baby
I'll grow up to be the President
I'm upside-in, I'm really tweaked
I'm really freaked, I'm really bent Big town mommas better hurry
Hide your little girls
I'll jump their bones
I'll sniff? em out? round the world Now somebody's gonna be sorry Now, somebody's gonna be sorry
Like all you wankers and you slime
And you right-wing pinheads
Who make screwing a big crime You titty-twisted up my life
And pissed on all my dreams
You made me hate myself
Now come on, shoot me, set me free I'm a huboon baby
I'm a cross between a human and an ape
Well, I'm all decked out
I'm gonna hoot, I'm gonna root, I'm gonna rape People look at me
And laugh and make fun of my face
I laugh right back
I don't want to be part of the human race I know I let you tell me what to do
You were confident you knew best
Now things aren't working like you want them to
Your confidence is what I detest You got me lookin' up high
You got me searchin' down low
You got me I know you know
You got me jerkin' back 'n' forth You told me, people like to suffer
You told me that's the way it is
You said that things were getting better
You said I should accept all this You think it's funny
But what I say is true
The reason that I live like this
Is all because of you You got me lookin' up high
You got me searchin' down low
You got me, I know you know
You got me jerkin' back 'n' forth There is a thought that keeps me thinking
Like a stone inside my shoe
It is a vision reoccurring
A dirty window I can see you through You think it's funny
But what I say is true
The reason that I live like this
Is all because of you You got me lookin' up high
You got me searchin' down low
You got me, I know you know
You got me jerkin' back 'n' forth You got me lookin' up high
You got me searchin' down low
You got me, I know you know
You got me jerkin' back 'n' forth Listen up y'all
It's D-E-V-O They say the night time is the right time
So now it's high time to choose your destiny
Take a hard line, let some fur fly
Learn to stay high above the stormy sea They say the new age is the big rage
And the next stage will bring us to the edge
Now, escape from your golden cage then
Turn the page on the demons in your head You gotta step up, get to the bottom of it
Dig deep and go behind the scene
You gotta step up and get to the bottom of it
Go deep, show 'em what it means You gotta step up, pull down and take a number
Hold firm, nip it in the bud
You gotta step up, pull down and take a number
Be firm, figure out what's what Step up They say the right time is the night time
So it's about time to do what you please
Avoid the drive-by, grip tight and steer right
Into some fine wine 'til you're buzzed and feeling free Well, it's not over 'til the cows come home
It's not over 'til the fat lady sings
It's never too late to grab some gold
It's never too late to shake that thing Shake
Nice
Let's go through this again Step up, get to the bottom of it
Dig deep and go behind the scene
You gotta step up and get to the bottom of it
Go deep, show 'em what it means You gotta step up, pull down and take a number
Hold firm, nip it in the bud
You gotta step up, pull down and take a number
Be firm, figure out what's what Step up If you smell the smoke
You don't need to be told
What you got to do Yet, there's a certain breed
Somewhere in between
They'd rather take a vote Running short on time
Still they can't decide
But we already know That we are here to go
We are here to go, we are here to go
We are here to go, we are here to What is really mine?
Who's at the top of the pile?
Where does he draw the line? Let them figure it out
Go on and step across
Just remind yourself
That we are here to go When it grows too long
The tail wags the dog
The hand that bites gets fed Troubles multiply
The crowd begins to cry
For some common sense Let them all dig in
When the odds are no win
Head for the nearest door 'Cause we are here to go
We are here to go, we are here to go
We are here to go, we are here to What is really mine?
Who's at the top of the pile?
Where does he draw the line? Let them figure it out
Go on and step across
Just remind yourself
That we are here to go, go Well, it's an open road
And it's full of life
Stretchin' on and on
But it stops somewhere Because time keeps tickin' away
Time keeps on tickin' away
Because time keeps tickin' away
Time keeps on tickin' away Let me tell you 'bout a boy
An average spud, he was twice in love
With two very different girls knowin' life is short
He told them both the truth but they already knew Now he's a happy guy
Now he's a happy guy
Now he's a happy guy Well, it's a random turn
On a game show wheel
Unpredictable
But it stops somewhere Because time keeps tickin' away
Time keeps on tickin' away
Because time keeps tickin' away
Time keeps on tickin' away Let me tell you 'bout a man
A tragic case, love kicked in his face
He shriveled up and died from a broken heart
Reincarnated as a work of art
He's got a brand new start Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey Now he's a happy guy
Now he's a happy guy
Now he's a happy guy
Now he's a happy guy I need a chick to suck my dick
I need a dog to lick my hog
I need a cat to stroke my bat
I'm pukin and shitin' and dyin' of thirst
I ain't got no field to plow
There's no hole for my pole
I'd fuck a mink stole
I need a woman who understands
There's nothing more spiritual
Than dog style love
And when I find her
I'm going to get down on my knees
I'm going to eat her
'cause she's the moon If you obey society's rules
You will be society's fools
You'll obey and then disobey
You'll disobey but then you'll obey
You thought your mom and dad were fools
You never wanted to listen in school
Now your mind won't go where you want to take it
You got a ride but you're not gonna make it You'll never catch up!
Dad. pass the catsup!
Clean that mess up! listen up! If you obey society's fools
You'll be society's tools
And you'll obey and then disobey
You'll disobey but then you'll obey
You thought your mom and dad were queer
You always wanted egg in your beer
Now your dog won't go
When you try to make it
He's got a bone but he's not gonna shake it If you take society's tools
You will make society's rules
Which you'll obey and then disobey
You'll disobey but then you'll obey That's all for now
That's all we know
This is the end Talking points
violent crimes
Bad news, every hour, every day
Talking heads The until

With a message of hope Loose weight
Rehab Clowns

Some treasure In a message of hope
So telling something we don't know Nobody knows

And I try, and I try, and I try, t-t-try, try

Big dog, playin' out your part.
Evil clown, a doggy with no heart.

Payback! Something in the air
Is telling me to go there
So I'll follow my nose
Go wherever it goes It's calling from around the corner
Waiting just outside of town
Trailing vapors sweet and tangy
Daring me to track it down It's blanketing the high-rise towers
Blasting through the sands of time
It's useless to resist its power
It's now or never So fresh
I'll search until I find it
So fresh
I'm closing in behind it
So fresh
Nothing could be better
So fresh
Like I died and went to heaven So fresh it almost makes me want to cry
So fresh it's givin' me a second life I see a fork in the road
Where it goes I don't know
I won't even think twice
I really don't have a choice It's calling from around the corner
Waiting just outside of town
Trailing vapors sweet and tangy
Daring me to track it down It's blanketing the high-rise towers
Blasting through the sands of time
It's useless to resist its power
It's now or never So fresh
I'll search until I find it
So fresh
I'm closing in behind it
So fresh
Nothing could be better So fresh
Like I died and went to heaven So fresh
So fresh
So fresh
So fresh So fresh it almost makes me want to cry
So fresh it's givin' me a second life So fresh it almost makes me want to cry
So fresh it's givin' me a second life So fresh! Since you came around
Wigglin' under my skin
I've been lost in the lost and found
Feeling like a helpless pin U got me bug, bug, bug, bug, bugged
Girl, I don't know what to do
U got me bug, bug, bug, bug, bugged
You fluttered on down As graceful as can be
Then you stuck in the needle
And sucked my blood
It was the love age that came over me U got me bug, bug, bug, bug, bugged
I don't know what to do
U got me bug, bug, bug, bug, bugged
I'm always bugged over you Now I'm hopelessly entangled
In the web of love you dangled
Helpless like a worm watch me twist and squirm
Your love has left me strangled U got me bug, bug, bug, bug, bugged
Girl, I don't know what to do
U got me bug, bug, bug, bug, bugged
Girl, I'm all bugged out over you You got me bug, bug, bug, bug
Now I'm hopelessly entangled
In the web of love you dangled
Should have trusted sick fear Now you stepped out on my tail
Your love has left me strangled
You got me bug, bug, bug, bug Are you ready?!

magnetic trumpets blowing
synthetic saxophones
the evidence was growing
from below
hidden motivations
buried in the past
still keeps them fighting over
love, love, love
signals start to travel
from a distant place
capture-latches activate
they're face to face
point and circle interlock
and begin exchange
lights go out, electroshock
the pleasure pain
magnetic trumpets blowing
synthetic saxophones
the evidence was growing
from below
hidden motivations
buried in the past
still keeps them fighting
over love
the psychology of desire
getting ready for the feast
the psychology of desire
it's the nature of the beast
the psychology of desire
sometimes last but never least
the psychology of desire
boy and girl
both drift apart, they
reconnect history repeats in order
it must protect
still they get together
cos it does the trick
even so, they scream and cry
they make each other
sick magnetic trumpets blowing
synthetic saxophones
the evidence was growing
from below
hidden motivations
buried in the past
still keeps them fighting
over love

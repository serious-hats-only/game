Love of mine
Someday you will die
But I'll be close behind
I'll follow you into the dark No blinding light
Or tunnels, to gates of white
Just our hands clasped so tight
Waiting for the hint of a spark If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark Catholic school, as vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
I held my tongue as she told me, son
Fear is the heart of love, so I never went back If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark You and me have seen everything to see
From Bangkok to Calgary
The soles of your shoes are all worn down
The time for sleep is now
It's nothing to cry about
Cause we'll hold each other soon
The blackest of rooms If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark I'll follow you into the dark There is whisky in the water
And there is death upon the vine
There is fear in the eyes of your father
And there is "Yours" and there is "Mine"
There is a desert veiled in pavement
And there's a city of seven hills
And all our debris flows to the ocean
To meet again, I hope it will How could something so fair
Be so cruel
When this black sun revolved
Around you! There is an answer in a question
And there is hope within despair
And there is beauty in a failure,
And there are depths beyond compare
There is a role of a lifetime
And there's a song yet to be sung
And there's a dumpster in the driveway
Of all the plans that came undone How could something so fair
Be so cruel
When this black sun revolved
Around you!
How could something so fair
Be so cruel
When this black sun revolved
Around you! There is whisky in the water
And there is death upon the vine
And there is grace within forgiveness
But it's so hard for me to find How could something so fair
Be so cruel
When this black sun revolved
Around you!
How could something so fair
Be so cruel
When this black sun revolved
Around you! I want to live where soul meets body
And let the sun wrap its arms around me and
Bathe my skin in water cool and cleansing
And feel
Feel what it's like to be new 'Cause in my head there's a Greyhound station
Where I send my thoughts to far off destinations
So they may have a chance of finding a place where they're
Far more suited than here I cannot guess what we'll discover
When we turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels
But I know our filthy hands can wash one another's
And not one speck will remain I do believe it's true
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you
Then I hope it takes me too So brown eyes I'll hold you near
'Cause you're the only song I want to hear
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere Where soul meets body
Where soul meets body
Where soul meets body I do believe it's true
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you
Then I hope it takes me too So brown eyes I'll hold you near
'Cause you're the only song I want to hear
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere How I wish you could see the potential,
the potential of you and me
It's like a book elegantly bound,
but in a language that you can't read just yet You gotta spend some time love, you gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find love, I will possess your heart
You gotta spend some time love, you gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find love, I will possess your heart There are days when outside your window,
I see my reflection as I slowly pass
And I long for this mirrored perspective,
when we'll be lovers, lovers at last You gotta spend some time love, you gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find love, I will possess your heart
You gotta spend some time love, you gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find love, I will possess your heart I will possess your heart
I will possess your heart You reject my advances and desperate pleas
I won't let you, let me down so easily, so easily You gotta spend some time love, you gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find love, I will possess your heart
You gotta spend some time love, you gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find love, I will possess your heart You gotta spend some time love, you gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find love, I will possess your heart I will possess your heart I will possess your heart I will possess your heart Love of mine
Someday you will die

The clouds above opened up and let it out
I was standing on the surface of a perforated sphere
When the water filled every hole
And thousands upon thousands made an ocean
Making islands where no islands should go (oh no) Most people were overjoyed they took to their boats
I thought it less like a lake and more like a moat
The rhythm of my footsteps crossing flatlands to your
Door have been silenced forevermore
And the distance is quite simply much to far for me to row
It seems farther than ever before (oh no) (I need you so much closer) (I need you so much closer) (So come on come on) I roll the window down
And then begin to breathe in
The darkest country road
And the strong scent of evergreen
From the passenger seat as you are driving me home Then looking upwards
I strain my eyes and try
To tell the difference between shooting stars and satellites
From the passenger seat as you are driving me home Do they collide?
I ask and you smile
With my feet on the dash
The world doesn't matter When you feel embarrassed then I'll be your pride
When you need directions then I'll be the guide
For all time
For all time And it came to me then
That every plan
Is a tiny prayer to father time As I stared at my shoes
In the ICU
That reeked of piss and 409 And I rationed my breaths
As I said to myself
That I'd already taken too much today As each descending peak
On the LCD
Took you a little farther away from me
Away from me Amongst the vending machines
And year old magazines
In a place where we only say goodbye It sung like a violent wind
That our memories depend
On a faulty camera in our minds And I knew that you were truth
I would rather loose
Than to have never lain beside at all And I looked around
At all the eyes on the ground
As the TV entertained itself Cause there's no comfort in the waiting room
Just nervous paces bracing for bad news
And then the nurse comes round
And everyone lifts their head
But I'm thinking of what Sarah said That love is watching someone die So who's gonna watch you die This is the moment that you know
That you told you loved her but you don't.
You touch her skin and then you think
That she is beautiful but she don't mean a thing to me.
Yeah, she is beautiful, but she don't mean a thing to me. I spent two weeks in Silverlake.
The California sun cascading down my face
There was a girl with light brown streaks
And she was beautiful but she didn't mean a thing to me.
Yeah, she was beautiful, but she didn't mean a thing to me. Wanted to believe in all the words that I was speaking
As we moved together in the dark.
And all the friends that I was telling.
And all the playful misspellings.
And every bite I gave you left a mark. Tiny vessels oozed into your neck
And formed the bruises,
That you said you didn't want to fade,
But they did and so did I that day. All I see are dark grey clouds
In the distance moving closer with every hour.
So when you ask "Was something wrong?",
That I think "You're damn right there is but we can't talk about it now.
No, we can't talk about it now." So one last touch and then you'll go.
And we'll pretend that it meant something so much more,
But it was vile, and it was cheap.
And you are beautiful, but you don't mean a thing to me
Yeah, you are beautiful, but you don't mean a thing to me.
Yeah, you are beautiful, but you don't mean a thing to me. There's a tear in the fabric of your favorite dress
And I'm sneaking glances.
Looking for the patterns in static
They start to make sense the longer I'm at it. Ivory lines lead Your heart is a river that flows from your chest
Through every organ
Your brain is the dam
And I am the fish who can't reach the core. Ivory lines lead Oh, instincts are misleading
You shouldn't think what you're feeling
They don't tell you what you know you should want. Ivory lines lead Ivory lines lead Oh, instincts are misleading
You shouldn't think what you're feeling
They don't tell you want you know you should want. Ivory lines lead Ivory lines lead Cath, she stands with a well-intentioned man
But she can't relax with his hands on the small of her back
And as the flash bulbs burst
She holds a smile like someone would hold a crying child And soon everybody will ask what became of you
And your heart was dying fast, and you didn't know what to do Cath, it seems that you live in someone else's dream
In a hand-me-down wedding dress
Where the things that could have been are oppressed
You said your vows, and you closed the door
On so many men who would have loved you more And soon everybody will ask what became of you
And your heart was dying fast, and you didn't know what to do The whispers that it won't last roll up and down the pews
But if their hearts were dying that fast,
They'd have done the same as you
And I'd have done the same as you. When the wind picked up
And the fire spread
And the grapevines seemed left for dead.
And the northern sky, looked like the end of day,
The end of days. The wake up call to a rented room
Sounded like an alarm of impending doom.
To warn us it's only a matter of time.
Before we all burn
Before we all burn
Before we all burn
Before we all burn. We bought some wine and some paper cups
Near your daughter's school when we picked her up
And drove to a cemetery on a hill,
On a hill. Watched the plumes paint the sky gray
As she laughed and danced through the field of graves
There I knew it would be alright
That everything would be alright,
Would be alright
Would be alright
Would be alright
Would be alright. And the news reports on the radio
Said it was getting worse
As the ocean air fanned the flames.
But I couldn't think of anywhere I would have rather been
To watch it all burn away,
To burn away. The firemen worked in double shifts,
With prayers for rain on their lips,
And they knew it was only a matter of time. (This... Fire... Grows... High...)
(This... Fire... Grows... High...)
(This... Fire... Grows... High...)
(This... Fire... Grows... High...) When there's a burning in your heart
An endless fury in your heart
Build it bigger than the sun
Let it grow
Let it grow
And there's a burning in your heart
Don't be alarmed (This... Fire... Grows... High...) When there's a doubt in your mind
'Cause you think it all the time
Framin' rights into wrongs
Move along
Move along
When there's a doubt within your mind When there's a burning in your heart
And you think it'll burst apart
Oh, there's nothing to fear
Save the tears
Save the tears When there's a burning in your heart And if you feel just like a tourist in the city you were born
Then, it's time to go
And you find your destination with so many different places to call home
'Cause when you find yourself a villain,
In the story you have written
It's plain to see
That sometimes the best intentions
Are in need of redemption
Would you agree
If so, please show me (This... Fire... Grows... High...)
(This... Fire... Grows... High...) When there's a burning in your heart,
When there's a burning in your heart, (This... Fire... Grows... High...)
When there's a burning in your heart, (This... Fire... Grows... High...)
(This... Fire... Grows... High...)
When there's a burning in your heart, (This... Fire... Grows... High...)
(This... Fire... Grows... High...)
When there's a burning in your heart. And when I see you
I really see you upside down
But my brain knows better
It picks you up and turns you around
Turns you around, turns you around If you feel discouraged
When there's a lack of color here
Please don't worry lover
It's really bursting at the seams
From absorbing everything, the spectrum's A to Z This is fact not fiction
For the first time in years
All the girls in every gillie magazine
Can't make me feel any less alone
I'm reaching for the phone
To call at 7:03 and on your machine
I slur a plea for you to come home
But I know it's too late
And I should have given you a reason to stay
Given you a reason to stay
Given you a reason to stay
Given you a reason to stay This is fact, not fiction
For the first time in years I don't know where to begin
There's too many things that I can't remember
As I disappeared like a trend
In the hum of the 5 in the early morning And now I'm taking my time
Up through Coalinga through the valley
This highway lived in my mind
It takes me back to the place that made me Was I in your way
When the cameras turned to face you?
No room in frame
For two You cannot outrun a ghost
Speeding south bound lanes with abandon
It catches you on the coast
Or on the cliffs of the Palisades you killed the engine And then it hovers above
Reeling bodies failing to discover
The thing they once knew as love
Raising their voices to convince one another Was I in your way
When the cameras turned to face you?
No room in frame
For two How can I stay
In the sun
When the rain flows
All through my veins
It's true And I guess it's not a failure we could help
And we'll both go on to get lonely with someone else
With someone else Was I in your way
When the cameras turned to face you?
No room in frame
For two How can I stay
In the sun
When the rain flows
All through my veins
It's true And I guess it's not a failure we could help
And we'll both go on to get lonely with someone else It was one hundred degrees as we sat beneath a willow tree
Whose tears didn't care they just hung in the air
And refused to fall, to fall I knew I'd made a horrible call
And now the state line felt like the Berlin wall
And there was no doubt about which side I was on 'Cause I built you a home in my heart
With rotten wood that decayed from the start
'Cause you can't find nothing at all
If there was nothing there all along
No, you can't find nothing at all
If there was nothing there all along I braved treacherous streets
And kids strung out on homemade speed
And we shared a bed in which I could not sleep at all 'Cause at night, the sun in retreat
Made the skyline look like crooked teeth
In the mouth of a man who was devouring us both You're so cute when you're slurring your speech
But they're closing the bar
And they want us to leave And you can't find nothing at all
If there was nothing there all along
No, you can't find nothing at all
If there was nothing there all along I'm the war of head versus heart
And it's always this way
My head is weak, my heart always speaks
Before I know what it will say And you can't find nothing at all
If there was nothing there all along
No, you can't find nothing at all
If there was nothing there all along And you can't find nothing at all
If there was nothing there all along
There were churches, theme parks and malls
There was nothing there all along Burn it down 'til the embers smoke on the ground
And start new when your heart is an empty room
With walls of the deepest blue Home's face
How it ages when you're away
And spring blooms and you find a love that's true
But you don't know what now to do
'Cause the chase is all you know and she stopped running months ago And all you see is where else you could be when you're at home
And out on the street are so many possibilities to not be alone The flames and smoke climbed out of every window
And disappeared with everything that you held dear
But you shed not a single tear
For the things that you didn't need
'Cause you knew you were finally free 'Cause all you see is where else you could be when you're at home
And there on the street are so many possibilities to not be alone Time for the final bow
Rows of deserted houses all
Our stable mates highway bound Give us our measly sum
Getting the air inside my lungs
Is heavenly starting out
With nothing but
Crippling doubt We'll rest easy
Justified Suffered a swift defeat
I'll endure countless repeats
The gift of memories
An awful curse
With age it just
Gets much worse But I won't mind
I won't mind Meet me on the Equinox
Meet me half way
When the sun is perched at it's highest peek
In the middle of the day Let me give my love to you
Let me take your hand
And as we walk in the dimming light
Oh darling understand That everything, everything ends
That everything, everything ends Meet me on your best behavior
Meet me at your worst
For there will be no stone unturned
Or bubble left to burst Let me lay beside you, darling
Let me be your man
And let our bodies intertwine
But always understand That everything, everything ends
That everything, everything ends
That everything, everything, everything ends A window
An opened tomb
The sun crawls
Across your bedroom
A halo
A waiting room
Your last breaths
Moving through you As everything, everything ends
As everything, everything ends
As everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything ends Meet me on the Equinox
Meet me half way
When the sun is perched at it's highest peek
In the middle of the day Let me give my love to you
Let me take your hand
And as we walk in the dimming light
Oh darling understand That everything, everything ends The glove compartment is inaccurately named
And everybody knows it
So I'm proposing a swift orderly change 'Cause behind its door, there's nothing to keep my fingers warm
And all I find are souvenirs from better times
Before the gleam of your taillights fading east
To find yourself a better life I was searching for some legal document
As the rain beat down on the hood
When I stumbled upon pictures I tried to forget
And that's how this idea was drilled into my head 'Cause it's too important to stay the way it's been There's no blame for how our love did slowly fade
And now that it's gone, it's like it wasn't there at all
And here I rest where disappointment and regret collide
Lying awake at night There's no blame for how our love did slowly fade
And now that it's gone, it's like it wasn't there at all
And here I rest where disappointment and regret collide
Lying awake at night, up all night
When I'm lying awake at night I know I got a bad reputation
And it isn't just talk, talk, talk
If I could only give you everything
You know I haven't got I couldn't have one conversation
If it wasn't for the lies, lies, lies
And still I want to tell you everything
Until I close my eyes Suddenly I'm on the street
Seven years disappeared below my feet
Been breaking down, do you want me now?
Do you want me now? Suddenly I'm down in Harold Square
Looking in a crowd your face is everywhere
Been turning around, do you want me now?
Do you want me now? Don't try to be an inspiration
You're just wasting your time, time, time
You know I'm about the best I'll ever be I see it in your eyes
I know I got a bad reputation
And it isn't just talk, talk, talk
If I could only give you everything
You know I haven't got Suddenly I'm on the street
Seven years disappeared below my feet
Been breaking down, do you want me now?
Do you want me now? Suddenly I'm in another place
Looking in the crowd
I think I see your face
Been turning around
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now? Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now? Don't you think I've heard the talk
Nobody's going to tell me who to look
Been breaking down do you want me now?
Do you want me now? Suddenly I'm in Harold Square
Looking in a crowd, your face is everywhere
Been turning around, do you want me now?
Do you want me now? Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now? But I'm just breaking down, down, down, down, down
Been breaking down, down, down, down, down
Been breaking down, down, down, down, down
Been breaking down, down, down, down, down And I'm standing up in my practice room
I'm all alone
Speaker's almost blown
And my new Gibson amp
Oh what the hell.... Things are not so different in my vocal master
You are the face that launched one thousand ships
Greeks and trojans and a thousand ships
The shits eyeing the shores of asia minor
Lining all the shores of asia minor
You can tell that im not a minor in asia no more
I'm standing up This is the face that launched a thousand ships
I'm standing up
This is the face that launched one thousand ships
This is the face that shot
Who never have replaced
Splitting up his kingdom into three seperate parts
For his sons and their three separate hearts We're not the same, dear, as we used to be
The seasons have changed and so have we
There was little we could say, and even less we could do
To stop the ice from getting thinner under me and you We bury our love in the wintery grave
A lump in the snow was all that remained
But we stayed by its side as the days turned to weeks
And the ice kept getting thinner with every word that we'd speak And when spring arrived
We were taken by surprise when the floes under our feet bled into the sea
And nothing was left for you and me We're not the same, dear
And it seems to me
There's nowhere we can go
With nothing underneath
And it saddens me to say
But we both know, well, it's true
That the ice was getting thinner
Under me and you
The ice was getting thinner
Under me and you Sometimes I think this cycle never ends
We slide from top to bottom and we turn and climb again
And it seems by the time that I have figured what it's worth
The squeaking of our skin against the steel has gotten worse But if I move my place in line I'll lose
And I have waited, the anticipation's got me glued I am waiting for something to go wrong
I am waiting for familiar resolve Sometimes it seems that I don't have the skills to recollect
The twists and turns of plots that took us from lovers to friends
I'm thinking I should take that volume back up off the shelf
And crack it's weary spine and read to help remind myself But if I move my place in line I'll lose
And I have waited, the anticipation's got me glued I am waiting for something to wrong
I am waiting for familiar resolve
I am waiting for another repeat
Another diet fed by crippling defeat
And I am waiting for that sense of relief
I am waiting for you to flee the scene
As if you held in your hand the smoking gun
And on the floor lay the one you said you loved And it's strange
They are basically the same
So I don't ask names anymore Sometimes I think this cycle never ends
We slide from top to bottom and we turn and climb again
And it seems by the time that I have figured what it's worth
The squeaking of our skin against the steel has gotten worse The squeaking of our skin against the steel has gotten worse
The squeaking of our skin against the steel has gotten worse I've got a hunger twisting my stomach into knots; that my tongue is tied off
My brain's repeating if you've got an impulse, let it out!
But they never make it past my mouth This is the sound of settling
This is the sound of settling Our youth is fleeting, old age is just around the bend and I can't wait to go gray
And I'll sit and wonder of every love that could have been
If I'd only thought of something charming to say This is the sound of settling
This is the sound of settling I've got a hunger twisting my stomach into knots I remember when the days were long,
And the nights when the living room was on the lawn.
Constant quarreling, the childish fits, and our clothes in a pile on the ottoman.
All the slander and double-speak
Were only foolish attempts to show you did not mean
Anything but the blatant proof was your lips touching mine in the photobooth. And as the summer's ending,
The cool air will put your hard heart away.
You were so condescending
And this is all that's left
Scraping paper to document.
I've packed a change of clothes and it's time to move on. Cup your mouth to compress the sound,
Skinny dipping with the kids from a nearby town.
And everything that I said was true,
As the flashes blinded us in the photobooth.
Well, I lost track, and then those words were said.
You took the wheel and you steered us into my bed.
Soon we woke and I walked you home,
And it was pretty clear that it was hardly love. And as the summer's ending,
The cool air will rush your hard heart away.
You were so condescending.
And this is all that's left
Scraping paper to document.
I've packed a change of clothes and it's time to move on. And as the summer's ending,
The cool air will rush your hard heart away.
You were so condescending,
As the alcohol drained the days. And as the summer's ending,
The cool air will rush your hard heart away.
You were so condescending.
And this is all that's left
The empty bottles, spent cigarettes.
So pack a change of clothes, 'cause it's time to move on. Squeaky swings and tall grass
The longest shadows ever cast
The waters warm and children swim
We frolicked about in our summer skin I don't recall a single care
Just greenery and humid air
Then Labor Day came and went
And we shed what was left of our summer skin On the night you left I came over
And we peeled the freckles from our shoulders
Our brand new coats so flushed and pink
And I knew your heart I couldn't win
Cause the seasons change was a conduit
And we'd left our love in our summer skin Life is sweet
In the belly of the beast
In the belly of the beast,
And with her song in your heart
It can never bring you down
It can never bring you down Lost in a maze
Of a thousand rainy days
Of a thousand rainy days
But when I heard her voice
Oh it led me to the end
(Oh, it led me to the end)
Yes it led me to the end 'Cause when she sings I hear a symphony
And I'm swallowed in sound as it echoes through me
I'm renewed, oh how I feel like
Through autumn's advancing, we'll stay young, go dancing As the music plays
Feel our bodies sway
When we move as one
We stay young
(Go dancing) Life is sweet
In the belly of the beast (In the belly of the beast)
In the belly of the beast
And when with her song in your heart
Oh it can never bring you down (It can never bring you down)
It can never bring you down 'Cause when she sings I hear a symphony
And I'm swallowed in sound as it echoes through me
I'm renewed, oh how I feel like
Through winter's advancing, we'll stay young go dancing
Stay young go dancing
Stay young go dancing So this is the new year
And I don't feel any different
The clanking of crystal
Explosions off in the distance (in the distance) So this is the new year
And I have no resolutions
For self assigned penance
For problems with easy solutions So everybody put your best suit or dress on
Let's make believe that we are wealthy for just this once
Lighting firecrackers off on the front lawn
As thirty dialogues bleed into one I wish the world was flat like the old days
Then I could travel just by folding a map
No more airplanes, or speed trains, or freeways
There'd be no distance that can hold us back There'd be no distance that could hold us back
There'd be no distance that could hold us back
There'd be no distance that could hold us back So this is the new year
So this is the new year
So this is the new year
So this is the new year His head was a city
Of paper buildings
And the echoes that remained
Of old friends and lovers
Their features bleeding
Together in his brain And once it started was harder to
Tell them apart He was always distracted
By the very mention
Of an open door
'Cause he had sworn not to be what he'd been before To be a remain remain remain remainder The television was snowing softly
As she hunted for her keys
She said she never envisioned him the type of person capable of such deceit And they carried on like long division
And it was clear with every page
That they were further away from a solution that would play Without a remain remain remain remainder He had sworn not to be what he'd been before To be the remain remain remain remainder It's a backwards attraction to your forward eyes
But you're so far-sighted that you can't place trust
In what or who you recognize
We sped the Plymouth cross the banks of the mississippi river
Mary Timony was smaller then a super ball Chitter-chatter all these secrets started giving me the shivers
Plain and simply broken down near olympia
I think your bruise was understanded
'Cause you can't feel this anymore
It's getting bluer and you can't keep faking
That you can't feel this anymore I descended a dusty gravel ridge
Beneath the Bixby Canyon Bridge
Until I eventually arrived
At the place where your soul had died Barefoot in the shallow creek,
I grabbed some stones from underneath
And waited for you to speak to me And the silence; it became so very clear
That you had long ago disappeared
I cursed myself for being surprised
That this didn't play like it did in my mind All the way from San Francisco
As I chased the end of your road
Cause I've still got miles to go And I want to know my fate
If I keep up this way And it's hard to want to stay awake
When everyone you need, they all seem to be asleep
And you wonder if you missed your dream You can't see a dream
You can't see a dream
You just can't see a dream And then it started getting dark
I truged back to where the car was parked
No closer to any kind of truth When I was young, lying in the grass
I felt so safe in a warming bath
Of sunlight
Of sunlight. Vast open sky
Could do no harm
Like an embrace
From mother's arms
In sunlight
In sunlight. In sunlight
In sunlight. With every year that came to pass
More clouds appear until the sky went black
And there was
No sunlight,
No sunlight.
And there was
No sunlight,
No sunlight anymore. You disappeared at the same speed
The idealistic things I believed
The optimist died inside of me
No sunlight,
No sunlight. No sunlight,
No sunlight. You disappeared with the same speed
The idealistic thing I believed
The optimist died inside of me
No sunlight,
No sunlight. No sunlight,
No sunlight. No sunlight,
No sunlight,
No sunlight,
No sunlight anymore. You look so defeated lying there in your new twin size bed
With a single pillow underneath your single head
I guess you decided that that old queen was more space than you would need
Now it's in the alley behind your apartment with a sign that says it's free And I hope you have more luck with this than me You used to think that someone would come along
And lay beside you in a space that they belong
But the other side of the mattress and box springs stayed like new
What's the point of holding onto what never gets used? Other than a sick desire for self-abuse And I try not to worry, but you've got me terrified
It's like your some kind of hurry to say goodbye, say goodbye, say goodbye You look so defeated lying there in your new twin size bed
You look so defeated lying there in your new twin size bed With every sun that sets I am feeling more
Like a stranger on a foreign shore
With an eroding beach disappearing from underneath And when my mirror speaks it never minces words
Because these eyes don't shine half as bright
As they used to do and they haven't for quite a while Because I'm a man who hides from all that binds
And a mess of fading lines
And there's a tangled thread inside my head
With nothing on either end I always fall in love with an open door
With a horizon on an endless sea
As I look around the ones who were standing right in front of me And then my mirror speaks with irreverence
Like a soldier I can't command
It sees a child in the body of a full-grown man And he's a man who hides from all that binds
And a mess of fading lines And there's a tangled thread inside his head
With nothing on either end
There's nothing on either end A new position for a different view
And nothing changes but the slightest hues
And I am standing face to face With a man who hides from all that binds
And a mess of fading lines
And there's a tangled thread inside his head
With nothing on either end I'm a man who hides from all that binds
And a mess of fading lines
And there's a tangled thread inside my head
With nothing on either end There's nothing on the ends
No there's nothing on the ends You may tire of me as our December sun is setting 'cause I'm not who I used to be
No longer easy on the eyes but these wrinkles masterfully disguise the youthful boy below
Who turned your way and saw something he was not looking for
Both a beginning and an end
But now he lives inside someone he does not recognize when he catches his reflection on accident On the back of a motorbike with your arms outstretched trying to take flight, leaving everything behind
But even at our swiftest speed we couldn't break from the concrete in the city where we still reside
And I have learned that even landlocked lovers yearn for the sea, like navy men,
'Cause now we say goodnight from our own separate sides like brothers on a hotel bed Sitting on a carousel ride without any music or light. everything was closed at
Conney Island, and I could not help from smiling.
I can hear the atlantic echo back roller coaster screams from summers past.
And everything was closed at coney island, and I could not help from smiling.
Brooklyn will fill in the beach eventually and everyone will go except me. I'm in Los Angeles today, it smells like an airport runway. jet fuel stenches
In the cabin and lights flickering at random. I'm in Los Angeles today, garbage cans comprise the medians of freeways always
Creeping even when the population's sleeping. And I can't see why you'd want to live here. I'm in Los Angeles today, asked a gas station employee if he ever had trouble
Breathing and he said "it varies from season to season, kid." It's where our best are on display: motion picture actors' houses maps are never
Ever current so save your film and $15. And I can't see why you'd want to live here.
Billboards reach past the tallest buildings,
"we are not perfect but we sure try."
As UV rays "degradate" our youth with time. The vessel keeps pumping us through this entropic place in the belly of the
Beast that is californ-I-A, I drank from a faucet and I kept my receipts for
When the weigh me on my way out (here nothing is free).
The greyhounds keep coming dumping locusts into the street until the gutters
Overflow and Los Angeles thinks, "I might explode someday soon." It's a lovely summer's day and I can almost see a skyline through a thickening
Shroud of egos. (is this the city of angeles or demons?)
Here the names are what remain: stars encapsulate the gold lame and they need
Constant cleaning for when the tourists begin salivating. You can't swim in a town this shallow - you will most assuredly drown tomorrow. And if it was just how you wanted
You'd be glued to his bones and his brain stem
And changing your image and attitudes
Won't bring you back into your bedroom
Amputating as he's waiting
He's unresponsive 'cause you're irresponsible
Little swinger your bottle is thinking too much
'Cause you're aiming to please way off target
And I'll tell you what you must already know
Of amputating that too slow I don't know if you can hear me
I'm feeling down and can't think clearly
And even though it's complicated
We've got time to start again
I don't know if you can hear me I'm sorry for the things I've said
But some thoughts just won't leave my head
And even though it''s complicated
We've got time to start again
I don't know if you can hear me Some things have changed but it's too late
I take the past and make it straight
And even though it's complicated
We've got time to start again
I don't know if you can hear me And even though it's complicated
We've got time to start again
I don't know if you can hear me It's gotten late and now I want to be alone
All of our friends were here, they all have gone home
And here I sit on the front porch watching the drunks stumble forth into the night "You gave me a heart attack, I did not see you there.
I thought you had disappeared so early away from here." And this is the chance I never got to make a move.
But we just talk about the people we've met in the last 5 years.
And will remember them in ten more?
I let you bum a smoke, you quit this winter past.
I've tried twice before but like this, it just will not last. If only you'd have known me before the accident
For with that grand collision came a grave consequence
Receptors overloaded, they burst and disconnect
'Til there was little feeling please work with what is left Oh I need not be flattered that you've never been here before
So there's no need to mention that you've no firsts anymore
But if you let me be your skyline I'll let you be the wave
That reduces me to rubble that looked safe from far away I don't know why, I don't know why
I return to the scenes of these crimes
Where the hedgerows slowly wind
Through the ghosts of Beverly Drive
I don't know why, I don't know why
I don't know what I expect to find
Where all the news is second hand
And everything just goes on as planned You wanna teach but not be taught
And I wanna sell but not be bought
So let us not be lonesome
So let us not be lonesome
Lost in between our needs and wants
Our needs and wants I don't know why, I don't know why
I return to the scenes of these crimes
Where the hedgerows slowly wind
Through the ghosts of Beverly Drive
I don't know why, I don't know why
I don't know what I expect to find
Where all the news is second hand
And everything just goes on as planned I don't know why, I don't know why
I don't know why, I don't know why
I don't know why, I don't know why
I don't know why, I don't know why You may tire of me
As our December sun is setting
'Cause I'm not who I used to be No longer easy on the eyes
But these wrinkles masterfully disguise
The youthful boy below Who turned your way and saw
Something he was not looking for
Both a beginning and an end But now he lives inside
Someone he does not recognize
When he catches his reflection on accident On the back of a motorbike
With your arms outstretched trying to take flight
leaving everything behind But even at our swiftest speed
We couldn't break from the concrete
In the city where we still reside And I have learned
That even landlocked lubbers yearn
For the sea like navy men 'Cause now we say goodnight
From our own separate sides
Like brothers on a hotel bed Like brothers on a hotel bed
Like brothers on a hotel bed
Like brothers on a hotel bed You may tire of me
As our December sun is setting
'Cause I'm not who I used to be I'll take the best of your bad moods
and dress them up to make a better you,
'cause all the company calls amount to one paycheck. I'd squeeze a heart through my fingertip,
but I type too slow to make expressions stick.
And it's like TV with a microchip. [Chorus]
Set your sights, destroy this party line,
Cause it's so tired.
Set your sights, destroy this mock-shrine,
Cause it's so tired. Let's cut our losses at both ends
and aim your car away from all our friends,
leaving the dishes stacked in the sink. [Chorus] I'd keep my distance 'cause the complications cloud it all,
and mail a postcard sending greetings from the Eastern Bloc.
Synapse to synapse: possibilities will thin or fade.
Your wedding figurines: I'd melt so I could drink them in,
and drink them in, and drink them in I'll take the best of your bad moods
and dress them up to make a better you,
'cause all the company calls amount to one paycheck. [Chorus: x2] Here comes the rain again
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion
I want to walk in the open wind
I want to talk like lovers do
I want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you So baby talk to me
Like lovers do
Walk with me
Like lovers do
Talk to me
Like lovers do Here comes the rain again
Raining in my head like a tragedy
Tearing me apart like a new emotion
Oooooh
I want to breathe in the open wind
I want to kiss like lovers do
I want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you So baby talk to me
Like lovers do Here comes the rain again
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion
(Here it comes again, here it comes again)
I want to walk in the open wind
I want to talk like lovers do
I want dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you We're starting to feel
We stayed together out of fear
Of dying alone
I've been slipping through the years
My old clothes don't fit like they once did
So they hang like ghosts
Of the people I've been It's like my heart can't take
My fall in love every day
And I feel like a fool I have to face the truth
That no one could ever look at me like you do
Like I'm something worth holding on to These times I think of leaving
But it's something I'll never do 'Cause you can do better than me
But I can't do better than you Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you I took the 405 and drilled a stake down into your center,
And stated that it's never ever been better than this.
I hung my favorite shirt on the floorboard, wrinkled up from pulling, pushing, and tasting, tasting... You keep twisting the truth
That keeps me thrown askew. Misguided by the 405 'cause it lead me to an alcoholic summer.
I missed the exit to you parents' house hours ago.
Red wine and the cigarettes: hide your bad habits underneath the patio, patio. You keep twisting the truth
That keeps me thrown askew. You keep twisting the truth
That keeps me thrown askew. Left uninspired by the crust of railroad earth;
It touched the land to the pages of your manuscript.
I took my thumb off the concrete and saved up my strength
To hammer pillars for a picket fence.
It wasn't quite what it seemed,
A lack of pleasantries.
My able body isn't what it used to be.
I must admit I was charmed by your advances,
Your advantage left me helplessly into you. Talking how the group had begun to splinter,
And I can taste your lipstick on the filter. I tried my best to keep my distance from your dress,
But call-response overturns convictions every time.
My memory cannot recall (a wave of alcohol),
We shared a cigarette and shaved the hours off. Talking how the group had begun to splinter,
And I can taste your lipstick on the filter. Lushing with the hallway congregation,
My best judgment signed its resignation. I rushed this.
We moved too fast,
Trips into the guest room.
I rushed this.
We moved too fast,
Trips into the guest room. You are my army and I would command
"Attack the Holy Land."
And you are that interstate
That I would roll my tanks down. So color me stunned.
And wake the children when done
And put the details in a jar
And bury them underwater I went to see these battlegrounds
With battlesounds.
And drove to the outskirts
With cars on blocks
And houses run down. So color me stunned
And wake the children when done
And put the details in a jar
And bury them underwater We'll gather up the family and
Display our diseased organs.
We'll call it pride
We'll celebrate tonight
Tax free and always underpriced. So color me stunned
And wake the children when done
And put the details in a jar
And bury them underwater There's a saltwater film on the jar of your ashes:
I threw them to sea but a
Gust blew them backwards and the sting in my eyes
That you then inflicted was par for the course just as when you were living. It's no stretch to say you were not quite a father but a donor of seeds to a
Poor single mother that would raise us alone,
We'd never see the money that
Went down your throat
Through the hole in your belly. Thirteen years old in the suburbs of Denver
Standing in line for Thanksgiving dinner at the catholic church. the servers
Wore crosses
To shield from the sufferance plauging the others.
Styrofoam plates, cafeteria
Tables charity reeks of cheap wine and pity
And I'm thinking of you. I do every year
When we count all our blessings
And wonder what we're doing here. You're a disgrace to the concept of family
The priest won't divulge that fact in his homily and I'll stand up and scream
If the mourning remain quiet,
You can deck out a lie in a suit but I won't buy it. I won't join in the procession that's speaking their peace.
Using five dollar words while praising his integrity.
And just cause he's gone it doesn't change the fact:
He was a bastard in life thus a bastard in death. I put on my overcoat and walked into winter, my teeth chattered rhythms
And they were grouped in twos or threes,
Like a Morse code message was sent from me to me.
Cars on slippery slopes, they're stuck: people pushing through
Their mittens as I was beginning to feel it soaking through my shoes,
Getting colder with every step I took to your apartment, dear. And I was a kaleidoscope, the snow on my lenses distorting the image of what
Was only one of you and I didn't know which one to address as all your lips
Moved. This is when I forget breathe all the things I scripted, they sound unfounded.
And the look that you're giving me, it tells me exactly what you are thinking,
"this ain't working anymore." They got their mothers worked into a panic
Sledding down hills into oncoming traffic
The parents layered clothes until the children couldn't move then kept them
Outside til their noises were blue and I got left there, too. I put on my overcoat and walked into winter, my teeth chattered rhythms.
And they were grouped in twos or threes like a Morse code message was sent from me
To me. Three wasted years, standing still
As you opened up, 18 miles wide
On this country drive
I can't keep up
Cause you're so far gone
And it's all too much hindsight
Three wasted years, wasting time
As the hunger pains grow inside I can't keep up
Cause you're so far gone
And it's all too much hindsight When we laugh indoors, the blissful tones bounce off the walls and fall to the ground.
Peel the hardwood back to let them loose from decades trapped and listen so still.
This city is my home, construction noise all day long and gutter punks are bumming change.
So I breed thicker skin and let me lustrous coat fill in and I'll never admit that
I loved you Guinevere. I've always fallen fast with too much trust in the promise that
"no one's ever been here, so you can quell those wet fears."
I want purity, I must have it here right now.
But don't you get me started now. December's chill comes late, the days get darker and we wait for this direness to pass.
There are piles on the floor of artifacts from dresser drawers, and I'll help you pack. Whenever I come back, the air on Railroad is making the same sounds,
And the shop fronts on Holly are dirty words (asterisks in for the vowels)
We peered through the windows, new bottoms on barstools but the people remain the same.
With prices inflating, as if saved from the gallows. There's a bellow of buzzers and the people stop working and they're all so excited. Passing through unconscious states, when I awoke, I was on the highway. With your hands on my shoulders, a meaningless movement, a movie script ending.
And the patrons are leaving, now we all know the words were true
In the sappiest songs (yes, yes) I'll put them to bed, but they won't sleep, they're just shuffling the sheets,
They toss and turn (you can't begin to get it back) Passing through unconscious states, when I awoke, I was on the onset of a later stage:
The headlights are beacons on the highway. Last night I dreamt that I was you
I was dressed all in black with dark glasses and attitude
Such a pose I could simply not hold
Through days in a northern town that I had once called a home
And your studies of fringe New York Streets
I was reading the pavement in every word you would speak
To a brownstone up three flights of stairs and it's on Buying drinks for the poets upstate
The southern corruption tows you down the interstate
And they all said that you were the king
Of a gloomy disruption that surfaced when you would sing
And this town simply cannot begin to compete
So I'm packing my Bullets and Silvertones and heading east
To a brownstone up three flights of stairs and it's on, on, on, on, it's I could have had my way, this year would bridge '66 again Trust fund hipsters were casing the room
Chock-full of amphetamines
The overturned kick drum boom
Set the pace with incomparable cool
And if the tempo was lousy it was lost on all but you
And your studies of fringe New York Streets
I was reading the pavement in every word you would speak
To a brownstone up three flights of stairs and it's on, on, on, on, it's If I could have had my way, this year would bridge '66 again If I could have had my way, this year would bridge '66 again You look so defeated lying there in your new twin size bed
With a single pillow underneath your single head
I guess you decided that that old queen was more space than you would need
Now it's in the alley behind your apartment with a sign that says it's free And I hope you have more luck with this than me You used to think that someone would come along
And lay beside you in a space that they belong
But the other side of the mattress and box springs stayed like new
What's the point of holding onto what never gets used? Other than a sick desire for self-abuse And I try not to worry, but you've got me terrified
It's like your some kind of hurry to say goodbye, say goodbye, say goodbye You look so defeated lying there in your new twin size bed
You look so defeated lying there in your new twin size bed I think I'm drunk enough to drive you home now
I'll keep my mouth kept shut from under lock and key
That's rusted firm, no lie
Cause all these conversations wind on and on Drinking champagne from a paper cup
Is never quite the same
And every sip's moving through my eyes
And up into my brain
At half past two, about time to leave
Cause the DJ's playing rhythm and blues
A sad-sorry state, stutter step to those slammin' grooves
As I'm waiting around for you His head was a city
of paper buildings
and the echoes that remained
of old friends and lovers
their features bleeding
together in his brain, oh ho ho And once it starts
it was harder to tell them apart, oh ho ho He was always distracted
by the very mention
of an open door, oh ho ho cuz he had sworn
not to be what he'd been before to be a remain remain remain remainder
to be a remain remain remain remainder The television was snowing softly
as she hunted for her keys
She said never envisioned
him the type of person
capable off such deceit, oh ho ho oh ho ho And then they carried on like long division
as it was clear with every page oh that they were further away
from a solution that would play without a remain remain remain remainder
without a remain remain remain remainder
without a remain remain remain remainder
without a remain remain remain remainder he had sworn not to be what he'd been before
to be the remain remain remain remainder
to be the remain remain remain remainder
to be the remain remain remain remainder
to be the remain remain remain remainder to be the remain remain remain remainder
to be the remain remain remain remainder The snow's coming down
I'm watching it fall
Watching the people around
Baby please come home The church bells in town
They're ringing a song
What a happy sound
Baby please come home They're singing deck the halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
All the fun we had last year Pretty lights on the tree
I'm watching them shine
You should be here with me
Baby please come home
Baby please come home They're singing deck the halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
All the fun we had last year If there was a way
I'd hold back these tears
But it's Christmas day
Baby please come home
Baby please come home
Baby please come home Once when my folks were gone
I saw a lot of liquor
I saw my tomcat
Famose
I saw my tomcat
What?
Tomcat
What?
My tomcat
Tomcat I saw a bowl of milk
And I said
"Hey"
What?
I got news for you
That's weird
I got news for you
I got news 10, 5, 0 meters
I think it's, um . . .
I like the beat a lot
And I like the pool
And I can dance around the room
And I Tomcat
Hello, tomcat
News for you
What, tomcat?
News for you
What, tomcat?
As you're listening to heart sounds
And murmurs
Instead of using words to
Describe them
It's somewhat like eating an apple
And trying to describe how it tastes What
Tomcat
So what?
The LSD
What?
I'm unsure I got news for you
Some kind of LSD
Sure enough, I'll come
Tomcat
And I'm sure
The rumors I got news for you
Hey, tomcat
And I'm sure the rumors
What, tomcat? And I'm sure the box I
And I'm sure the box
Some kind of L word
One of the LS words
What the LS?
The L word
The LSD pill and the cat What is going on, motherfucker?
No, no
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
There's salt
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
You're so flustered
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba You're so flustered
I excel at stone
When given the exposed
I am Brian She may be young but she only likes old things
And modern music it ain't to her taste
She loves the natural light
Captured in black and white She sees mirages of mountain ranges
Within a blink of her eyes it changes
Back to the open plain
Oh no she can't explain I cry out love, keep your arms around me
I am a bird that's in need of grounding
I'm built to fly away,
I never learned how to stay The night is gonna fall and the vultures will surround you
And when you're looking in the mirror what you see is gonna astound you
But all these lines and greys refine, they are the maps of our design
Of what began on Monday morning Monday morning
Monday morning Monday morning
Monday morning The night is gonna fall and the vultures will surround you
And when you're looking in the mirror what you see is gonna astound you
But all these lines and greys refine, they are the maps of our design
Of what began on Monday morning Oh yes the night is gonna fall and the vultures will surround you
And when you're looking in the mirror what you see is gonna astound you
And while the glow of youth in time eludes, it's burning on inside of you
It all began on Monday morning Monday morning
Monday morning I once knew a girl
In the years of my youth
With eyes like the summer
All beauty and truth In the mourning I fled
Left a note and it read
Someday you will be loved I cannot pretend that I felt any regret
Cause each broken heart will eventually mend
As the blood runs red down the needle and thread
Someday you will be loved You'll be loved, you'll be loved
Like you never have known
And the memories of me will seem more like bad dreams
Just a series of blurs like I never occurred
Someday you will be loved You may feel alone
When you're falling asleep
Every time tears roll down your cheek
But I know your heart belongs
To someone you've yet to meet
Someday you will be loved You'll be loved, you'll be loved
Like you never have known
And the memories of me will seem more like bad dreams
Just a series of blurs like I never occurred
Someday you will be loved You'll be loved, you'll be loved
Like you never have known
And the memories of me will seem more like bad dreams
Just a series of blurs like I never occurred
Someday you will be loved Someday you will be loved Alone on a train aimless in wander
An outdated map crumpled in my pocket
But I didn't care where I was going
'Cause they're all different names for the same place The coast disappeared when the sea drowned the sun
I knew no words to share it with anyone
The boundaries of language I quietly cursed
And all the different names for the same thing If I could open my arms
And span the length of the isle of Manhattan
I'd bring it to where you are
Making a lake of the East River and Hudson If I could open my mouth
Wide enough for a marching band to march out
They would make your name sing
And bend through allies and bounce off all the buildings I wish we could open our eyes
To see in all directions at the same
Oh what a beautiful view
If you were never aware of what was around you And it is true what you said
That I live like a hermit in my own head
But when the sun shines again
I'll pull the curtains and blinds to let the light in Sorrow drips into your heart through a pin hole
Just like a faucet that leaks and there is comfort in the sound
But while you debate half empty and half full
It slowly rises, your love is gonna drown Sorrow drips into your heart through a pin hole
Just like a faucet that leaks and there is comfort in the sound
But while you debate half empty and half full
It slowly rises, your love is gonna drown Sorrow drips into your heart through a pin hole
Just like a faucet that leaks and there is comfort in the sound
But while you debate half empty and half full
It slowly rises, your love is gonna drown Sorrow drips into your heart through a pin hole
Just like a faucet that leaks and there is comfort in the sound
But while you debate half empty and half full
It slowly rises, your love is gonna drown Your love is gonna drown
Your love is gonna drown
Your love is gonna drown
Your love is gonna Time for the final bout
Rows of deserted houses
All our stable mates are highway bound
Give us our measly sum
Getting the air inside my lungs is heavenly
We're starting out with nothing but crippling doubt We'll rest easy (justified)
I've suffered a swift defeat
I'll endure countless repeats
The gift of memory is an awful curse,
With age it just gets much worse,
But I won't mind. I won't mind
I won't mind
I won't mind Photographs of the best time you had,
Windows smudged by the speed.
Leaving home with our bags from Iron Street,
As morning turned into California,
And smoke trailed from the butt of my cigarette.
Our glass house it threw rocks at all those it past. Waking up to the sound of 5 A.M. to take my turn at the wheel.
Climbed up Shasta, oh how the engine ached
As the sun tortured California,
And old alleys turned deep at the heart of me.
Murals of heroes defacing the blank concrete. Vision tunneled, Mission Street, hunger beat
Lodged out as the engine wheezed.
Still moving regardless of stable ground
And this stable ground. Photographs of the best time you had,
Windows smudged by the speed.
Leaving home with our bags from Iron street
As morning turned into California. Sometimes, I talk like a turnstile
When I have had too much to drink
A tangled tongue like English Ivy
Just like a film dubbed out of sync The phone is ringing in the guest room
A muffled voice on the machine
It's either someone I don't want to talk to
Or someone selling what I don't need
As I'm waiting for you to come on home Sometimes, I fall in fits of laughter
My bottle shatters on the floor
And you apologize profusely
For the drunkard on the lawn I'll change, love, change
I'll change for you
Because even slurred words
Can contain some truth I'll change, love, change
I'll change for you
When I am ready to You see nothing to be adored, when obsession takes it's toll
You can't place you in between the pages of fashion magazines
Paper cuts from turning pages, just like a bad dream
Is it this or that or me that makes you owe? what you can't defeat Boiled over burning clean toward the flesh blocks? in your knees
It's a lesson that just might keep suppressing appetites
Paper cuts from turning pages, just like a bad dream
Is it this or that or me that makes you owe? what And I live this life just to bear these scars
Will the hurt subside, if you decide?
That's it's me and you this time
Is it you that always, is it you that decides And I live this life just to bear these scars
Will the hurt subside, if you decide?
And I live this life just to bear these scars
Will the hurt subside, if you decide? I think you caught me on the downslide, downturn
I was busy writing with a pen and paper thin dream
And all your plastic people with plastic hearts and smiles
They had the worst intentions all along after all The royal castle holds the mellow drama kings and queens
And all their dazzling children; they're so regal (clean)
With pristine fingertips they wash behind their ears
And let their hair down 'til the audiences leave
I'm definitely shaking The silence isn't breaking
Back-washed and stranded memories
Of something I thought could be And so it is
Just like you said it would be
Life goes easy on me
Most of the time
And so it is
The shorter story
No love, no glory
No hero in her sky I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes... And so it is
Just like you said it should be
We'll both forget the breeze
Most of the time
And so it is
The colder water
The blower's daughter
The pupil in denial I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off of you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes off you
I can't take my eyes... Did I say that I loathe you?
Did I say that I want to
Leave it all behind? I can't take my mind off of you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off of you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind off you
I can't take my mind...
My mind...my mind...
'Til I find somebody new This won't be the last from me, its just the start.
I hope that he keeps you up for weeks like you did to me. I will hold a candle up to you to singe your skin.
Brace yourself: I'm bent with bitterness. I can't foresee. When your apologies fail to ring true,
So slick with that sarcastic slew
Of phrases like "I thought you knew"
While keeping me in hot pursuit. Tracing the plot finds
Skin touching skin.
Absence follows. In the end, I win every time as ink remains.
Sour tastes prevail as you play back the tape machine. When your apologies fail to ring true,
So slick with that sarcastic slew
Of phrases like "I thought you knew"
While keeping me in such hot pursuit. Tracing the plot finds
Skin touching skin.
Absence follows. Every town has a diner, where I'll meet you and your friends, too.
Things are just a bit nicer over some coffee. You can tell me all about your day.
I don't know much about you, not that I want to. Not that I want to.
Sometimes I can't escape from my room, so excuse me, I'll be just a little late You will wait for me. Every town has a corner, where I'll see you and your friends, too.
Hang out looking cool. Saying the same things over and over again.
Sometimes we all feel stupid, we say the wrong things. You're not the only one.
Sometimes we all get left behind in a race of style, it's a dumb thing. You will wait for me. Oh Atlas could not understand
The world was so much smaller than
The one he used to hold before
But the weight it brought him to the floor
As you watched him struggle to his feet
You took photos capturing his defeat
And messaged them to all your friends
And we all laughed at his expense Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh Oh come my love and swim with me
Out in this vast Binary Sea
Zeros and ones patterns appear
They'll prove to all that we were here
For if there is no document
We cannot build our monument
So look into the lens and I'll
Make sure this moment never dies Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh Oh Atlas could not stay engaged
Was more distracted every day
You slowly fell into disarray
Just trying to think of something to say
For if there is no document
There cannot be a monument
So lean in close or lend an ear
There's something brilliant bound to happen here I want to live where soul meets body
And let the sun wrap its arms around me and
Bathe my skin in water cool and cleansing
And feel
Feel what it's like to be new 'Cause in my head there's a Greyhound station
Where I send my thoughts to far off destinations
So they may have a chance of finding a place where they're
Far more suited than here I cannot guess what we'll discover
When we turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels
But I know our filthy hands can wash one another's
And not one speck will remain I do believe it's true
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you
Then I hope it takes me too So brown eyes I'll hold you near
'Cause you're the only song I want to hear
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere Where soul meets body
Where soul meets body
Where soul meets body I do believe it's true
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you
Then I hope it takes me too So brown eyes I'll hold you near
'Cause you're the only song I want to hear
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere You'll never have to hear the word "no"
If you keep all your friends on the payroll
The non-disclosure pages signed
Your secret's safe between those lines
The scaffolding will cheer and console you
But remember what your mother told you
That good help is so hard to find
For people that are so refined You're trying to turn into the skid
In this never-ending grid There's a long, slow fade
To a darkened stage
And I hear you say
"Only a fool gives it away"
Only a fool would give
Only a fool gives it away You said you wanna stake out your claim
High above the city from where you came
Don't you know the air's so thin?
It starves the brain of oxygen
I know it's such a dangerous place
For there are more ascensions than there is space
Angels causing accidents
The camera phones'll document
But if I start to levitate
Pull me down with all your weight There's a long, slow fade
To a darkened stage
And I hear you say
"Only a fool gives it away"
Only a fool would give
Only a fool gives it away You're trying to turn into the skid
In this never-ending grid
But you should know it's not ideal
All those hands upon the wheel There's a long, slow fade
To a darkened stage
And I hear you say
"Only a fool gives it away"
There's a long, slow fade
To a darkened stage
And I hear you say
"Only a fool gives it away"
Only a fool would give
Only a fool would give
Only a fool would give
Only a fool gives this away

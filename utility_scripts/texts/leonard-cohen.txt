Now I've heard, there was a secret chord
that David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor falls, the major lifts
The baffled king composing
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
and from your lips she drew the Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah You say, "I took the Name in vain
I dont even know the Name"
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesnt matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah I did my best, but it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah If you are the dealer
I'm out of the game
If you are the healer it means
I'm broken and lame
If thine is the glory then
Mine must be the shame
You want it darker
We kill the flame Magnified, sanctified
Be the holy name
Feel the fire, crucified
In the human frame
A million candles burning
For the help that never came
You want it darker Hineni, hineni
I'm ready, My Lord There's a lover in the story
But the story's still the same
There's a lullaby for suffering
And a paradox to blame
But it's written in the scriptures
And it's not some idol claim
You want it darker
We killed the flame You're lining up to prisoners
And the guards are taking him
I struggle with some demons
They were middle class and dean
I didn't know I had permission
To murder and to mend
You want it darker Hineni, hineni
I'm ready, My Lord Magnified, sanctified
Be the holy name
Feel the fire, crucified
In the human frame
A million candles burning
For the love that never came
You want it darker
We killed the flame If you are the dealer
Let me out of the game
If you are the healer
I'm broken and lame
If thine is the glory
Mine must be the shame
You want it darker Hineni, hineni
Hineni, hineni
I'm ready, My Lord Hineni Hineni Hineni Hineni Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
You can hear the boats go by
And you can spend the night beside her
And you know, that she's half crazy But that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China And just when you mean to tell her
That you have no love to give her
Then she gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that she will trust you
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind And Jesus was a sailor
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching
From his lonely wooden tower And when he knew for certain
Only drowning men could see him
He said: "All men will be sailors then
Until the sea shall free them" But he himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind Now, Suzanne takes your hand
And she leads you to the river
She is wearing rags and feathers
From Salvation Army counters And the sun pours down like honey
On our lady of the harbor
And she shows you where to look
Among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror
And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that you can trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind Now I've heard, there was a secret chord

For she's touched your perfect body with her mind Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely in
Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love Oh let me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone
Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon
Show me slowly what I only know the limits of
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love Dance me to the wedding now, dance me on and on
Dance me very tenderly and dance me very long
We're both of us beneath our love, we're both of us above
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love Dance me to the children who are asking to be born
Dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn
Raise a tent of shelter now, though every thread is torn
Dance me to the end of love Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic till I'm gathered safely in
Touch me with your naked hand or touch me with your glove
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love I loved you in the morning
Our kisses deep and warm
Your hair upon the pillow
Like a sleepy golden storm.
Yes, many loved before us
I know that we are not new,
In city and in forest
They smiled like me and you,
But now it's come to distances
And both of us must try,
Your eyes are soft with sorrow,
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye. I'm not looking for another
As I wander in my time,
Walk me to the corner
Our steps will always rhyme,
You know my love goes with you
As your love stays with me,
It's just the way it changes
Like the shoreline and the sea,
But let's not talk of love or chains
And things we can't untie,
Your eyes are soft with sorrow,
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye. I loved you in the morning
Our kisses deep and warm,
Your hair upon the pillow
Like a sleepy golden storm.
Yes, many loved before us
I know that we are not new,
In city and in forest
They smiled like me and you
But let's not talk of love or chains
And things we can't untie,
Your eyes are soft with sorrow
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye. I saw Jesus on the cross on a hill called Calvary
"Do you hate mankind for what they done to you?"
He said, "Talk of love not hate, things to do - it's getting late.
I've so little time and I'm only passing through." Passing through, passing through.
Sometimes happy, sometimes blue,
glad that I ran into you.
Tell the people that you saw me passing through. I saw Adam leave the Garden with an apple in his hand,
I said "Now you're out, what are you going to do?"
"Plant some crops and pray for rain, maybe raise a little cane.
I'm an orphan now, and I'm only passing through." Passing through, passing through ... I was with Washington at Valley Ford, shivering in the snow.
I said, "How come the men here suffer like they do?"
"Men will suffer, men will fight, even die for what is right
even though they know they're only passing through" Passing through, passing through ... I was with Franklin Roosevelt's side on the night before he died.
He said, "One world must come out of World War Two" (ah, the fool)
"Yankee, Russian, white or tan," he said, "A man is still a man.
We're all on one road, and we're only passing through." Passing through, passing through ... (let's do it one more time) Passing through, passing through ... I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were talking so brave and so sweet
Giving me head on the unmade bed
While the limousines wait in the street And those were the reasons and that was New York
We were running for the money and the flesh
And that was called love for the workers in song
Probably still is for those who've never left Ah, but you got away, didn't you, baby?
You just threw it all to the ground
You got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you, I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were famous, your heart was a legend
You told me again you preferred handsome men
But for me you'd make an exception And then clenching your fist for the ones like us
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
You fixed yourself, you said, "Well, never mind"
We are ugly but we have the music And then you got away, didn't you, baby?
Ah, you just turned your back on the crowd
You got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you, I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best
I can't keep track of each fallen robin
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
That's all, my little darling, I don't even think of you that often If you want a lover I'll do anything you ask me to And if you want another kind of love
I'll wear a mask for you
If you want a partner, take my hand, or
If you want to strike me down in anger Here I stand
I'm your man
If you want a boxer
I will step into the ring for you
And if you want a doctor
I'll examine every inch of you
If you want a driver, climb inside
Or if you want to take me for a ride You know you can
I'm your man
Ah, the moon's too bright
The chain's too tight
The beast won't go to sleep
I've been running through These promises to you
That I made and I could not keep
Ah, but a man never got a woman back
Not by begging on his knees
Or I'd crawl to you baby
And I'd fall at your feet
And I'd howl at your beauty
Like a dog in heat
And I'd claw at your heart
And I'd tear at your sheet I'd say please (please)
I'm your man
And if you've got to sleep a moment on the road
I will steer for you
And if you want to work the street alone
I'll disappear for you
If you want a father for your child
Or only want to walk with me a while across the sand
I'm your man
If you want a lover
I'll do anything that you ask me to
And if you want another kind of love
I'll wear a mask for you Come over to the window, my little darling
I'd like to try to read your palm.
I used to think I was some kind of Gypsy boy
before I let you take me home. Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began
to laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again. Well you know that I love to live with you
but you make me forget so very much.
I forget to pray for the angels
and then the angels forget to pray for us. Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began ... We met when we were almost young
deep in the green lilac park.
You held on to me like I was a crucifix
as we went kneeling through the dark. Oh so long, Marianne, it's time that we began ... Your letters they all say that you're beside me now.
Then why do I feel alone?
I'm standing on a ledge and your fine spider web
is fastening my ankle to a stone. Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began ... For now I need your hidden love.
I'm cold as a new razor blade.
You left when I told you I was curious
I never said that I was brave.
Oh so long, Marianne, it's time that we began ...
Oh, you are really such a pretty one.
I see you've gone and changed your name again.
And just when I climbed this whole mountainside
to wash my eyelids in the rain!
Oh so long, Marianne, it's time that we began ... You came to me this morning
And you handled me like meat
You? d have to be a man to know
How good that feels, how sweet My mirror twin, my next of kin
I? d know you in my sleep
And who but you would take me in
A thousand kisses deep I loved you when you opened
Like a lily to the heat
You see I? m just another snowman
Standing in the rain and sleet Who loved you with his frozen love
His secondhand physique
With all he is and all he was
A thousand kisses deep I know you had to lie to me
I know you had to cheat
To pose all hot and high
Behind the veils of sheer deceit Our perfect porn aristocrat
So elegant and cheap
I? m old but I? m still into that
A thousand kisses deep I? m good at love, I? m good at hate
It? s in between I freeze
Been working out but it? s too late
(It? s been too late for years) But you look good, you really do
They love you on the street
If you were here I? d kneel for you
A thousand kisses deep The autumn moved across your skin
Got something in my eye
A light that doesn? t need to live
And doesn? t need to die A riddle in the book of love
Obscure and obsolete
And witnessed here in time and blood
A thousand kisses deep But I? m still working with the wine
Still dancing cheek to cheek
The band is playing Auld Lang Syne
But the heart will not retreat I ran with Diz, I sang with Ray
I never had their sweet
But once or twice they let me play
A thousand kisses deep I loved you when you opened
Like a lily to the heat
You see I? m just another snowman
Standing in the rain and sleet Who loved you with his frozen love
His secondhand physique
With all he is and all he was
A thousand kisses deep But you don? t need to hear me now
And every word I speak
It counts against me anyhow
A thousand kisses deep I love to speak with Leonard
He's a sportsman and a shepherd
He's a lazy bastard
Living in a suit But he does say what I tell him
Even though it isn't welcome
He just doesn't have the freedom
To refuse He will speak these words of wisdom
Like a sage, a man of vision
Though he knows he's really nothing
But the brief elaboration of a tube Going home without my sorrow
Going home sometime tomorrow
Going home to where it's better
Than before Going home without my burden
Going home behind the curtain
Going home without the costume
That I wore He wants to write a love song
An anthem of forgiving
A manual for living
With defeat A cry above the suffering
A sacrifice recovering
But that isn't what I need him
To complete I want him to be certain
That he doesn't have a burden
That he doesn't need a vision That he only has permission
To do my instant bidding
Which is to say what I have told him
To repeat Going home without my sorrow
Going home sometime tomorrow
Going home to where it's better
Than before Going home without my burden
Going home behind the curtain
Going home without this costume
That I wore Going home without my sorrow
Going home sometime tomorrow
Going home to where it's better
Than before Going home without my burden
Going home behind the curtain
Going home without this costume
That I wore I love to speak with Leonard
He's a sportsman and a shepherd
He's a lazy bastard
Living in a suit It's four in the morning, the end of December
I'm writing you now just to see if you're better
New York is cold, but I like where I'm living
There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening. I hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert
You're living for nothing now, I hope you're keeping some kind of record. Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair
She said that you gave it to her
That night that you planned to go clear
Did you ever go clear? Ah, the last time we saw you you looked so much older
Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder
You'd been to the station to meet every train
And you came home without Lili Marlene And you treated my woman to a flake of your life
And when she came back she was nobody's wife. Well I see you there with the rose in your teeth
One more thin gypsy thief
Well I see Jane's awake She sends her regards. ...
And what can I tell you my brother, my killer
What can I possibly say?
I guess that I miss you, I guess I forgive you I'm glad you stood in my way.
If you ever come by here, for Jane or for me
Your enemy is sleeping, and his woman is free.
Yes, and thanks, for the trouble you took from her eyes
I thought it was there for good so I never tried.
And Jane came by with a lock of your hair
She said that you gave it to her
That night that you planned to go clear --
Sincerely, L. Cohen Ah we're drinking and we're dancing
and the band is really happening
and the Johnny Walker wisdom running high
And my very sweet companion
she's the Angel of Compassion
she's rubbing half the world against her thigh
And every drinker every dancer
lifts a happy face to thank her
the fiddler fiddles something so sublime
all the women tear their blouses off
and the men they dance on the polka-dots
and it's partner found, it's partner lost
and it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops:
it's CLOSING TIME Yeah the women tear their blouses off
and the men they dance on the polka-dots
and it's partner found, it's partner lost
and it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops:
it's CLOSING TIME Ah we're lonely, we're romantic
and the cider's laced with acid
and the Holy Spirit's crying, "Where's the beef?"
And the moon is swimming naked
and the summer night is fragrant
with a mighty expectation of relief
So we struggle and we stagger
down the snakes and up the ladder
to the tower where the blessed hours chime
and I swear it happened just like this:
a sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss
the Gates of Love they budged an inch
I can't say much has happened since
but CLOSING TIME I swear it happened just like this:
a sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss
the Gates of Love they budged an inch
I can't say much has happened since
CLOSING TIME I loved you for your beauty
but that doesn't make a fool of me:
you were in it for your beauty too
and I loved you for your body
there's a voice that sounds like God to me
declaring, declaring, declaring that your body's really you
And I loved you when our love was blessed
and I love you now there's nothing left
but sorrow and a sense of overtime
and I missed you since the place got wrecked
And I just don't care what happens next
looks like freedom but it feels like death
it's something in between, I guess
it's CLOSING TIME Yeah I missed you since the place got wrecked
By the winds of change and the weeds of sex
looks like freedom but it feels like death
it's something in between, I guess
it's CLOSING TIME Yeah we're drinking and we're dancing
but there's nothing really happening
and the place is dead as Heaven on a Saturday night
And my very close companion
gets me fumbling gets me laughing
she's a hundred but she's wearing
something tight
and I lift my glass to the Awful Truth
which you can't reveal to the Ears of Youth
except to say it isn't worth a dime
And the whole damn place goes crazy twice
and it's once for the devil and once for Christ
but the Boss don't like these dizzy heights
we're busted in the blinding lights,
busted in the blinding lights
of CLOSING TIME The whole damn place goes crazy twice
and it's once for the devil and once for Christ
but the Boss don't like these dizzy heights
we're busted in the blinding lights,
busted in the blinding lights
of CLOSING TIME Oh the women tear their blouses off the men they dance on the polka-dots
It's CLOSING TIME
And it's partner found, it's partner lost
and it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops
It's CLOSING TIME
I swear it happened just like this:
a sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss
It's CLOSING TIME
The Gates of Love they budged an inch
I can't say much has happened since
But CLOSING TIME
I loved you when our love was blessed
I love you now there's nothing left
But CLOSING TIME
I miss you since the place got wrecked
By the winds of change and the weeds of sex. Now in Vienna there's ten pretty women
There's a shoulder where death comes to cry
There's a lobby with nine hundred windows
There's a tree where the doves go to die
There's a piece that was torn from the morning
And it hangs in theGallery of Frost Aey, aey, aey, aey
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws Oh I want you, I want you, I want you
On a chair with a dead magazine
In the cave at the tip of the lily
In some hallway where love's never been
On a bed where the moon has been sweating
In a cry filled with footsteps and sand Aey, aey, aey, aey
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take its broken waist in your hand
This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz
With its very own breath of brandy and death
Dragging its tail in the sea There's a concert hall in Vienna
Where your mouth had a thousand reviews
There's a bar where the boys have stopped talking
They've been sentenced to death by the blues
But who is it climbs to your picture
With a garland of freshly cut tears? Aey, aey, aey, aey
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take this waltz it's been dying for years There's an attic where children are playing
Where I've got to lie down with you soon
In a dream of Hungarian lanterns
In the mist of some sweet afternoon
And I'll see what you've chained to your sorrow
All your sheep and your lilies of snow Aey, aey, aey, aey
Take this waltz, take this waltz
With its, I'll never forget you, you know
This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz
With its very own breath of brandy and death
Dragging its tail in the sea And I'll dance with you in Vienna
I'll be wearing a river's disguise
The hyacinth wild on my shoulder
My mouth on the dew of your thighs
And I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook
With the photographs there, and the moss
And I'll yield to the flood of your beauty
My cheap violin and my cross
And you'll carry me down on your dancing
To the pools that you lift on your wrist
Oh my love, oh my love
Take this waltz, take this waltz
It's yours now, it's all that there is
Aey, aey, aey, aey You can dance-every dance with the guy
Who gives you the eye, let him hold you tight
You can smile-every smile for the man
Who held your hand neath the pale moon light
But don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin' save the last dance for me Oh I know that the music's fine
Like sparklin' wine, go and have your fun
Laugh and sing, but while we're apart
Don't give your heart to anyone
But don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin' save the last dance for me Baby don't you know I love you so
Can't you feel it when we touch
I will never, never let you go
I love you oh so much You can dance, go and carry on
Till the night is gone
And it's time to go
If he asks if you're all alone
Can he walk you home, you must tell him no
'Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
Save the last dance for me Oh I know that the music's fine
Like sparklin' wine, go and have your fun
Laugh and sing, but while we're apart
Don't give your heart to anyone And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darling, save the last dance for me So don't forget who's taking you home
Or in whose arms you're gonna be
So darling, Save the last dance for me Oh baby won't you save the last dance for me
Oh baby won't you promise that you'll save,
The last dance for me
Save the last dance, the very last dance for me. If it be your will, that I speak no more
And my voice be still, as it was before
I will speak no more, I shall abide until
I am spoken for, if it be your will If it be your will, that a voice be true
From this broken hill, I will sing to you
From this broken hill
All your praises they shall ring
If it be your will, to let me sing From this broken hill
All your praises they shall ring
If it be your will, to let me sing If it be your will, if there is a choice
Let the rivers fill, let the hills rejoice
Let your mercy spill
On all these burning hearts in Hell
If it be your will, to make us well And draw us near and bind us tight
All your children here, in their rags of light
In our rags of light, all dressed to kill
And end this night, if it be your will
If it be your will I'm slowing down the tune
I've never liked it fast
You wanna get there soon
I wanna get there last
It's not because I'm old
It's not the life I led
I always liked it slow
That's what my mamma said I'm lacing up my shoes
But I don't want to run
I'll get there when i do
Don't need no starting gun
It's not because i'm old
And it's not what dying does
I've always liked it slow
Slow is in my blood I've always like it slow
I never liked it fast
With you it's got to go
With me it's got to last
It's not because I'm old
It's not because I'm dead
I've always liked it slow
That's what my mama said All your moves are swift
All your turns are tight
Let me catch my breath
I thought we had all night
I like to take my time
I like to linger as it flies
A weekend on your lips
A lifetime in your eyes I've always like it slow
I never liked it fast
With you it's got to go
With me it's got to last
It's not because I'm old
It's not the life I led
I've always like it slow
That's what my mama said I'm slowing down the tune
I've never liked it fast
You wanna get there soon
I wanna get there last
So, baby let me go
You're wanted back in town
In case they want to know
I'm just trying to slow down They sentenced me to 20 years of boredom
For trying to change the system from within
I'm coming now, I'm coming to reward them
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin I'm guided by a signal in the heavens (Guided, guided)
I'm guided by this birthmark on my skin (I am guided by)
I'm guided by the beauty of our weapons (Ooh, ooh)
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin I'd really like to live beside you, baby
I love your body and your spirit and your clothes
But you see that line there moving through the station?
I told you, I told you, told you I was one of those Ah, you loved me as a loser, but now you're worried that I just might win
You know the way to stop me, but you don't have the discipline
How many nights I prayed for this, to let my work begin
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin I don't like your fashion business, mister
And I don't like these drugs that keep you thin
I don't like what happened to my sister
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin I'd really like to live beside you, baby
I love your body and your spirit and your clothes
But you see that line there moving through the station?
I told you, I told you, told you I was one of those And I thank you for those items that you sent me, ha ha ha ha
The monkey and the plywood violin
I practiced every night, now I'm ready
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin I am guided Ah, remember me, I used to live for music (Baby)
Remember me, I brought your groceries in (Ooh, baby, yeah)
Well, it's Father's Day, and everybody's wounded
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin Baby, I've been waiting
I've been waiting night and day
I didn't see the time
I waited half my life away
There were lots of invitations
And I know you sent me some
But I was waiting
For the miracle, for the miracle to come I know you really loved me
But, you see, my hands were tied
I know it must have hurt you
It must have hurt your pride
To have to stand beneath my window
With your bugle and your drum
And me, I'm up there waiting
For the miracle, for the miracle to come Ah, I don't believe you'd like it
You wouldn't like it here
There ain't no entertainment
And the judgments are severe
The Maestro says it's Mozart
But it sounds like bubble gum
When you're waiting
For the miracle, for the miracle to come Waiting for the miracle
There's nothing left to do
I haven't been this happy
Since the end of World War II Nothing left to do
When you know that you've been taken
Nothing left to do
When you're begging for a crumb
Nothing left to do
When you've got to go on waiting
Waiting for the miracle to come I dreamed about you, baby
It was just the other night
Most of you was naked
Ah, but some of you was light
The sands of time were falling
From your fingers and your thumb
And you were waiting
For the miracle, for the miracle to come Ah baby, let's get married
We've been alone too long
Let's be alone together
Let's see if we're that strong
Yeah, let's do something crazy
Something absolutely wrong
While we're waiting
For the miracle, for the miracle to come Nothing left to do
When you know that you've been taken
Nothing left to do
When you're begging for a crumb
Nothing left to do
When you've got to go on waiting
Waiting for the miracle to come
When you've fallen on the highway
And you're lying in the rain
And they ask you how you're doing
Of course you'll say you can't complain
If you're squeezed for information
That's when you've got to play it dumb
You just say you're out there waiting
For the miracle, for the miracle to come Like a bird on the wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free
Like a worm on a hook
Like a knight from some old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee If I, if I have been unkind
I hope that you can just let it go by
If I, if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you Like a baby, stillborn
like a beast with his horn I have torn everyone who reached out for me
But I swear by this song
and by all that I have done wrong I will make it all up to thee
I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch
he said to me, "You must not ask for so much."
And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door
She cried to me, "Hey, why not ask for more?"
Oh like a bird on the wire Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free It's true that all the men you knew were dealers
Who said they were through with dealing
Every time you gave them shelter
I know that kind of man
It's hard to hold the hand of anyone
Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender
Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
You find he did not leave you very much not even laughter
Like any dealer he was watching for the card
That is so high and wild
He'll never need to deal another
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger And then leaning on your window sill
He'll say one day you caused his will
To weaken with your love and warmth and shelter
And then taking from his wallet
An old schedule of trains, he'll say
I told you when I came, I was a stranger
I told you when I came, I was a stranger But now another stranger seems
To want you to ignore his dreams
As though they were the burden of some other
Oh you've seen that man before
His golden arm dispatching cards
But now it's rusted from the elbow to the finger
And he wants to trade the game he plays for shelter
Yes he wants to trade the game he knows for shelter Ah you hate to watch another tired man
Lay down his hand
Like he was giving up the holy game of poker
And while he talks his dreams to sleep
You notice there's a highway
That is curling up like smoke above his shoulder
It is curling just like smoke above his shoulder You tell him to come in sit down
But something makes you turn around
But door is open, you can't close your shelter
You try the handle of the road
It opens do not be afraid
It's you my love, you who are the stranger
And it's you my love, you who are the stranger Well, I've been waiting, I was sure
We'd meet between the trains we're waiting for
I think it's time to board another
Please understand, I never had a secret chart
To get me to the heart of this or any other matter
When he talks like this, you don't know what he's after
When he speaks like this, you don't know what he's after Let's meet tomorrow if you choose
Upon the shore, beneath the bridge
That they are building on some endless river
Then he leaves the platform for the sleeping car that's warm
You realize, he's only advertising one more shelter
And it comes to you, he never was a stranger
And you say, "Okay the bridge or someplace later" And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
You find he did not leave you very much not even laughter
Like any dealer he was watching for the card
That is so high and wild
He'll never need to deal another
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger And leaning on your window sill
He'll say one day you caused his will
To weaken with your love and warmth and shelter
And then taking from his wallet
An old schedule of trains, he'll say
I told you when I came, I was a stranger
I told you when I came, I was a stranger
I told you when I came I was a stranger The birds they sang
at the break of day
Start again
I heard them say
Don't dwell on what
has passed away
or what is yet to be. Ah the wars they will
be fought again
The holy dove
She will be caught again9
bought and sold
and bought again
the dove is never free. Ring the bells that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack in everything
That's how the light gets in. We asked for signs
the signs were sent:
the birth betrayed
the marriage spent
Yeah the widowhood
of every government --
signs for all to see. I can't run no more
with that lawless crowd
while the killers in high places
say their prayers out loud.
But they've summoned, they've summoned up
a thundercloud
and they're going to hear from me. Ring the bells that still can ring ...
You can add up the parts
but you won't have the sum
You can strike up the march there is no drum
Every heart, every heart
to love will come
but like a refugee.
Ring the bells that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack, a crack in everything That's how the light gets in.
Ring the bells that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack, a crack in everything
That's how the light gets in.
That's how the light gets in.
That's how the light gets in. I was waltzing with my darling
To the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
Introduced him to my loved one
And while they were waltzing
My friend stole my sweetheart from me. I remember the night
And the Tennessee Waltz
'Cause I know just how much I have lost
Yes, I lost my little darling
The night they were playing
That beautiful Tennessee Waltz. She goes dancin' with the darkness
To the Tennessee Waltz
And I feel like I'm falling apart
And it's stronger than drink
And it's deeper than sorrow
This darkness she left in my heart. I remember the night
And the Tennessee Waltz
'Cause I know just how much I have lost
Yes, I lost my little darling
The night they were playing
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz... Now the flames they followed Joan of Arc
As she came riding through the dark
No moon to keep her Armour bright
Then no man to get her through this darkest very smoky night She said, "I'm tired of the war
I want the kind of work I had before
With a wedding dress or something white
To wear upon my swollen appetite" Well, I'm glad to to hear you talk this way
You see I've watched you riding all most every single day
And theres something in me yearns to win
Such a very cold and such a very lonesome heroine ? Well then, who are you?" she sternly spoke
To the one beneath the smoke
"Why, I'm, I'm fire," he replied
"And I love your solitude, how I love your sense of pride" "Well then fire, make your body cold
I'm gonna give you mine to hold"
Saying this she climbed inside
To be his one, to be his only bride It was deep into his fiery heart
He took the dust of a Joan of Arc
And high above all these assembled wedding guests
He hung the ashes of her very lovely wedding dress It was deep deep into his fiery heart
That he took the dust of all precious Joan of Arc
Then she clearly clearly understood
If if he was fire, oh she must be wood I saw her wince, I saw her cry
I saw the glory in her eye
Myself I long, I long for love and light
But must it come so cruel, and must it must it be so very bright? I'm leaving the table
I'm out of the game
I don't know the people
In your picture frame
If I ever loved you or no, no
It's a crying shame if I ever loved you
If I knew your name You don't need a lawyer
I'm not making a claim
You don't need to surrender
I'm not taking aim
I don't need a lover, no, no
The wretched beast is tame
I don't need a lover
So blow out the flame There's nobody missing
There is no reward
Little by little
We're cutting the cord
We're spending the treasure, oh, no, no
That love cannot afford
I know you can feel it
The sweetness restored I don't need a reason
For what I became
I've got these excuses
They're tired and lame
I don't need a pardon, no, no, no, no, no
There's no one left to blame
I'm leaving the table
I'm out of the game I'm leaving the table
I'm out of the game The war was lost
The treaty signed
I was not caught
I crossed the line
I was not caught
Though many tried
I live among you
Well-disguised I had to leave
My life behind
I dug some graves
You'll never find
The story's told
With facts and lies
I had a name
But never mind Never mind
Never mind
The war was lost
The treaty signed
There's Truth that lives
And Truth that dies
I don't know which
So never mind (...السلام و السلام) Your victory
Was so complete
Some among you
Thought to keep
A record of
Our little lives
The clothes we wore
Our spoons our knives The games of luck
Our soldiers played
The stones we cut
The songs we made
Our law of peace
Which understands
A husband leads
A wife commands And all of these
Expressions of the
Sweet indifference
Some called love
The high indifference
Some call fate
But we had names
More intimate Names so deep
And names so true
They're blood to me
Dust to you
There is no need
And this survives
There's Truth that lives
And Truth that dies Never mind
Never mind
I leave the life
I left behind
There's Truth that lives
And Truth that dies
I don't know which
So never mind (...السلام و السلام) I could not kill
The way you kill
I could not hate
I tried, I failed
You turned me in
At least you tried
You side with them whom
You despise This was your heart
This swarm of flies
This was once your mouth
This bowl of lies
You serve them well
I'm not surprised
You're of their kin
You're of their kind Never mind
Never mind
I had to leave my
Life behind
The story's told
With facts and lies
You own the world
So never mind Never mind
Never mind
I live the life
I left behind
I live it full
I live it wide
Through layers of time
You can't divide My woman's here
My children too
Their graves are safe
From ghosts like you
In places deep
With roots entwined
I live the life
I left behind السلام و السلام The war was lost
The treaty signed
I was not caught
Across the line
I was not caught
Tho many tried
I live among you
Well-disguised Give me back my broken night
My mirrored room, my secret life
It's lonely here
There's no one left to torture Give me absolute control
Over every living soul
And lie beside me, baby
That's an order Give me crack and anal sex
Take the only tree that's left
And stuff it up the hole
In your culture Give me back the Berlin wall
Give me Stalin and St. Paul
I've seen the future, brother
It is murder Things are going to slide, slide in all directions
Won't be nothing
Nothing you can measure anymore
The blizzard, the blizzard of the world
Has crossed the threshold and it has overturned
The order of the soul When they said repent repent
I wonder what they meant
When they said repent repent
I wonder what they meant
When they said repent repent
I wonder what they meant You don't know me from the wind
You never will, you never did
I'm the little Jew
Who wrote the Bible I've seen the nations rise and fall
I've heard their stories, heard them all
But love's the only engine of survival Your servant here, he has been told
To say it clear, to say it cold
It's over, it ain't going
Any further And now the wheels of heaven stop
You feel the devil's riding crop
Get ready for the future
It is murder Things are going to slide, slide in all directions
Won't be nothing
Nothing you can measure anymore
The blizzard, the blizzard of the world
Has crossed the threshold and it has overturned
The order of the soul When they said repent repent
I wonder what they meant
When they said repent repent
I wonder what they meant
When they said repent repent
I wonder what they meant There'll be the breaking of the ancient western code
Your private life will suddenly explode
There'll be phantoms
There'll be fires on the road
And the white man dancing You'll see a woman hanging upside down
Her features covered by her fallen gown
And all the lousy little poets coming round
Tryin' to sound like Charlie Manson
And the white man dancin' Give me back the Berlin wall
Give me Stalin and St. Paul
Give me Christ
Or give me Hiroshima Destroy another fetus now
We don't like children anyhow
I've seen the future, baby
It is murder Things are going to slide, slide in all directions
Won't be nothing
Nothing you can measure anymore
The blizzard, the blizzard of the world
Has crossed the threshold and it has overturned
The order of the soul When they said repent repent
I wonder what they meant
When they said repent repent
I wonder what they meant
When they said repent repent
I wonder what they meant
When they said repent repent And who by fire, who by water
Who in the sunshine, who in the night time
Who by high ordeal, who by common trial
Who in your merry merry month of may
Who by very slow decay
And who shall I say is calling? And who in her lonely slip, who by barbiturate
Who in these realms of love, who by something blunt
And who by avalanche, who by powder
Who for his greed, who for his hunger
And who shall I say is calling? And who by brave assent, who by accident
Who in solitude, who in this mirror
Who by his lady's command, who by his own hand
Who in mortal chains, who in power
And who shall I say is calling? I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were talkin' so brave and so sweet
Givin' me head on the unmade bed
While the limousines wait in the street Those were the reason an' that was New York
We were runnin' for the money and the flesh
An' that was called love for the workers in song
Probably still is for those of them left Ah, but you got away, didn't you babe
You just turned your back on the crowd
You got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around I remember you well in Chelsea Hotel
You were famous, your heart was a legend
You told me again you preferred handsome men
But for me you would make an exception An' clenching your fist for the ones like us
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
You fixed yourself, you said, "Well, never mind
We are ugly but we have the music" And then you got away, didn't you baby
You just turned your back on the crowd
You got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best
I can't keep track of each fallen robin
I remember you well in Chelsea Hotel
That's all, I don't even think of you that often When they poured across the border
I was cautioned to surrender
This I could not do
I took my gun and vanished I have changed my name so often
I've lost my wife and children
But I have many friends
And some of them are with me An old woman gave us shelter
Kept us hidden in the garret
Then the soldiers came
She died without a whisper There were three of us this morning
I'm the only one this evening
But I must go on
The frontiers are my prison Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing
Through the graves the wind is blowing
Freedom soon will come
Then we'll come from shadow Les allemands e'taient chez moi
Ils me dirent, "signe toi"
Mais je n'ai pas peur
J'ai repris mon âme J'ai change' cent fois de nom
J'ai perdu femme et enfants
Mais j'ai tant d'amis
J'ai la france entie`re Un vieil homme dans un grenier
Pour la nuit nous a cache'
Les allemands l'ont pris
Il est mort sans surprise Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing
Through the graves the wind is blowing
Freedom soon will come
Then we'll come from the shadow I caught the darkness,
It was drinking from your cup.
I caught the darkness,
Drinking from your cup.
I said is this contagious?
You said just drink it up. I got no future,
I know my days are few.
The presence not that pleasant,
Just a lot of things to do.
I thought the past would last me
But the darkness got that too. I should've seen it coming
It was right behind your eyes.
You were young and it was summer
I just had to take a dive. Winin' you was easy, but darkness was the price. I don't smoke no cigarette, I don't drink no alcohol
I ain't had much loving yet
But that's always been your call.
Hey I don't miss it baby
I got no taste for anything at all I used to love the rainbow
And I used to love the view.
Another early morning, I'd pretend that it was you.
But I caught the darkness baby
And I got it worse than you. I caught the darkness,
It was drinking from your cup.
I caught the darkness,
Drinking from your cup.
I said is this contagious?
You said just drink it up. I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were talking so brave and so sweet
Giving me head on the unmade bed
While the Limousines wait in the street Those were the reason and that was New York
We were running for the money and the flesh
And that was called love for the workers in song
Probably still is for those of them left Ah, but you got away, didn't you, babe?
You just turned your back on the crowd
You got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you, I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were famous, your heart was a legend
You told me again you preferred handsome men
But for me you would make an exception And clenching your fist for the ones like us
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
You fixed yourself, you said, "Well never mind

I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best
You got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you, I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best
I can't keep track of each fallen robin
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
That's all, I don't even think of you that often I've seen you change the water into wine
I've seen you change it back to water, too
I sit at your table every night
I try but I just don't get by with you
I wish there was a treaty we could sign
I do not care who takes this bloody hill
I'm angry and I'm tired all the time
I wish there was a treaty,
I wish there was a treaty
Between your love and mine Ah, they're dancing in the street it's jubilee
We sold ourselves for love but now we're free
I'm so sorry for that ghost I made you be
Only one of us was real and that was me I haven't said a word since you been gone
That any liar couldn't say as well
I just can't believe the static coming on
You were my ground, my safe and sound
You were my Ariel Ah, the fields are crying out it's jubilee
We sold ourselves for love but now we're free
I'm so sorry for that ghost I made you be
Only one of us was real and that was me I heard the snake was baffled by his sin
He shed his scales to find the snake within
But born again is born without a skin
The poison enters into everything And I wish there was a treaty we could sign
I do not care who takes this bloody hill
I'm angry and I'm tired all the time
I wish there was a treaty,
I wish there was a treaty
Between your love and mine I'm traveling light
It's au revoir
My once so bright, my fallen star
I'm running late, they'll close the bar
I used to play one mean guitar
I guess I'm just somebody who
Has given up on the me and you
I'm not alone, I've met a few
Traveling light like we used to do Good night, good night, my fallen star
I guess you're right, you always are
I know you're right about the blues
You live some life you'd never choose
I'm just a fool, a dreamer who forgot to dream of the me and you
I'm not alone, I've met a few
Traveling light like we used to do Traveling light
It's au revoir
My once so bright, my fallen star
I'm running late, they'll close the bar
I used to play one mean guitar
I guess I'm just somebody who
Has given up on the me and you
I'm not alone, I've met a few
Traveling light like we used to do But if the road leads back to you
Must I forget the things I knew
When I was friends with one or two
Traveling light like we used to
I'm traveling light Well I stepped into an avalanche,
it covered up my soul;
when I am not this hunchback that you see,
I sleep beneath the golden hills
You who wish to conquer pain,
you must learn, learn to serve me well. You strike my side by accident
as you go down for your gold
The crippled h i that you clothe and feed
is neither starved nor cold
He does not ask for your company,
not at the centre, the centre of the world. When I am on a piedestal,
you did not raise me there.
Your laws do not compel me
to kneel grotesque and bare
I myself am the piedestal
for this ugly hump at which you stare You who wish to conquer pain,
you must learn what makes me kind
the crumbs of love that you offer me,
they're the crumbs I've left behind.
Your pain is no credential here,
it's just the shadow, shadow of my wound I have begun to long for you,
I who have no greed
I have begun to ask for you,
I who have no need
You say you've gone away from me,
but I can feel you when you breathe. Do not dress in those rags for me,
I know you are not poor
you don't love me quite so fiercely now
when you know that you are not sure,
it is your turn, beloved,
it is your flesh that I wear. Well, my friends are gone and my hair is grey
I ache in the places where I used to play
And I'm crazy for love but I'm not comin' on.
I'm just payin' my rent every day in the Tower of Song I said to Hank Williams "How lonely does it get?"
Hank Williams hasn't answered yet
But I hear him coughing all night long
Oh, a hundred floors above me in the Tower of Song I was born like this, I had no choice
I was born with the gift of a golden voice
And twenty-seven angels from the Great Beyond,
They tied me to this table right here in the Tower of Song So you can stick your little pins in that voodoo doll
I'm very sorry, baby, it doesn't look like me at all
I'm standin' by the window where the light is strong
Ah, they don't let a woman kill you, not in the Tower of Song Now, you can say that I've grown bitter but of this you may be sure:
The rich have got their channels in the bedrooms of the poor
And there's a mighty Judgement comin' but I may be wrong
You see, I hear these funny voices in the Tower of Song I see you standin' on the other side
I don't know how the river got so wide
I loved you, baby, way back when...
And all the bridges are burnin' that we might've crossed
But I feel so close to everything that we lost
We'll never, we'll never have to lose it again. Now, I bid you farewell, I don't know when I'll be back
They're movin' us tomorrow to the tower down the track
But you'll be hearin' from me, baby, long after I'm gone
I'll be speakin' to you sweetly from a window in the Tower of Song. Yeah, my friends are gone and my hair is grey
I ache in the places where I used to play
And I'm crazy for love but I'm not comin' on.
I'm just payin' my rent everyday in the Tower of Song. You got me singing
Even though the news is bad
You got me singing
The only song I ever had You got me singing
Ever since the river died
You got me thinking
Of places we could hide You got me singing
(Singing,) even tho the world is gone
You got me thinking
(Thinking) that I'd like to carry on You got me singing
(Signing,) even tho it all looks grim
You got me singing
(Singing) the Hallelujah hymn (Singing that Hallelujah hymn) You got me singing
Like a prisoner in a jail
You got me singing
Like my pardon's in the mail You got me wishing
Our little love would last
You got me thinking
Like those people of the past You got me singing
(Signing,) even tho the world is gone
You got me thinking
(Thinking that) I'd like to carry on You got me singing
(Singing,) even it all went wrong
You got me singing
(Singing) the Hallelujah song O, gather up the brokenness
Bring it to me now
The fragrance of those promises
You never dared to vow The splinters that you carried
The cross you left behind
Come healing of the body
Come healing of the mind And let the heavens hear it
The penitential hymn
Come healing of the spirit
Come healing of the limb Behold the gates of mercy
In arbitrary space
And none of us deserving
Of cruelty or the grace O, solitude of longing
Where love has been confined
Come healing of the body
Come healing of the mind O, see the darkness yielding That tore the light apart
Come healing of the reason
Come healing of the heart O, troubledness concealing
An undivided love
The heart beneath is teaching
To the broken heart above And let the heavens falter
Let the earth proclaim
Come healing of the altar
Come healing of the name O, longing of the branches
To lift the little bud
O, longing of the arteries
To purify the blood And let the heavens hear it
The penitential hymn
Come healing of the spirit
Come healing of the limb O let the heavens hear it
The penitential hymn
Come healing of the spirit
Come healing of the limb If the sun would lose its light
And we lived an endless night
And there was nothing left that you could feel
That's how it would be
What my life would seem to me
If I didn't have your love to make it real If the stars were all unpinned
And a cold and bitter wind
Swallowed up the world without a trace
Ah, well that's where I would be
What my life would seem to me
If I couldn't lift the veil and see your face
And if no leaves were on the tree
And no water in the sea
And the break of day had nothing to reveal
That's how broken I would be
What my life would seem to me
If I didn't have your love to make it real If the sun would lose its light
And we lived in an endless night
And there was nothing left that you could feel
If the sea were sand alone
And the flowers made of stone
And no one that you hurt could ever heal
Well that's how broken I would be
What my life would seem to me
If I didn't have your love to make it real Tell me again when I've been to the river
And I've taken the edge off my thirst
Tell me again we're alone and I'm listening
Listening so hard that it hurts
Tell me again when I'm clean and I'm sober
Tell me again when I've seen through the horror
Tell me again tell me over and over
Tell me that you'll want me then
Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen Tell me again when the victims are singing
And the laws of remorse are restored
Tell me again that you know what I'm thinking
But vengeance belongs to the lord
Tell me again when I'm clean and I'm sober
Tell me again when I've seen through the horror
Tell me again tell me over and over
Tell me that you'll love me then
Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen 
Tell me again when the day has been ransomed
And the night has no right to begin
Try me again when the angels are panting
And scratching at the door to come in
Tell me again when I'm clean and I'm sober
Tell me again when I've seen through the horror
Tell me again tell me over and over
Tell me that you'll leave me then
Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen Tell me again when the filth of the butcher
Is washed in the blood of the lamb
Tell me again when the rest of the culture
Has passed through the eye of the camp
Tell me again when I'm clean and I'm sober
Tell me again when I've seen through the horror
Tell me again tell me over and over
Tell me that you'll love me then
Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen Oh the sisters of mercy
they are not departed or gone
They were waiting for me
when I thought that I just can't go on
And they brought me their comfort
and later they brought me this song
Oh I hope you run into them
you who've been travelling so long Yes you who must leave everything
that you cannot control
it begins with your family
but soon it comes round to your soul
Well, I've been where you're hanging
I think I can see how you're pinned
When you're not feeling holy
your loneliness says that you've sinned They lay down beside me
I made my confession to them
They touched both my eyes
and I touched the dew on their hem
If your life is a leaf
that the seasons tear off and condemn
They will bind you with love
that is graceful and green as a stem When I left they were sleeping
I hope you run into them soon
Don't turn on the lights
you can read their address by the moon
And you won't make me jealous
if I hear that they sweetened your night
We weren't lovers like that
and besides it would still be all right We weren't lovers like that
and besides it would still be all right I loved you for a long, long time
I know this love is real
It don't matter how it all went wrong
That don't change the way I feel
And I can't believe that time's
Gonna heal this wound I'm speaking of
There ain't no cure,
There ain't no cure,
There Ain't No Cure For Love I'm aching for you baby
I can't pretend I'm not
I need to see you naked
In your body and your thought
I've got you like a habit
And I'll never get enough
There ain't no cure,
There ain't no cure,
There Ain't No Cure For Love There Ain't No Cure For Love
There Ain't No Cure For Love
All the rocket ships are climbing through the sky
The holy books are open wide
The doctors working day and night
But they'll never ever find that cure for love
There ain't no drink no drug
(Ah tell them, angels)
There's nothing pure enough to be a cure for love I see you in the subway and I see you on the bus
I see you lying down with me, I see you waking up
I see your hand, I see your hair
Your bracelets and your brush
And I call to you, I call to you
But I don't call soft enough
There ain't no cure,
There ain't no cure,
There Ain't No Cure For Love I walked into this empty church I had no place else to go
When the sweetest voice I ever heard, whispered to my soul
I don't need to be forgiven for loving you so much
It's written in the scriptures
It's written there in blood
I even heard the angels declare it from above
There ain't no cure,
There ain't no cure,
There Ain't No Cure For Love There Ain't No Cure For Love
There Ain't No Cure For Love
All the rocket ships are climbing through the sky
The holy books are open wide
The doctors working day and night
But they'll never ever find that cure,
That cure for love I asked my father
I said, "Father change my name."
The one I'm using now it's covered up
With fear and filth and cowardice and shame Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me He said, "I locked you in this body
I meant it as a kind of trial
You can use it for a weapon
Or to make some woman smile." Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me "Then let me start again," I cried
"Please let me start again
I want a face that's fair this time
I want a spirit that is calm." Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me "I never never turned aside," he said
"I never walked away
It was you who built the temple
It was you who covered up my face." Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me And may the spirit of this song
May it rise up pure and free
May it be a shield for you
A shield against the enemy Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me A wandering Canadian,
Banned from his hearths,
Travelled while crying
In foreign lands.
Travelled while crying
In foreign lands. One day, sad and pensive,
Sitting by the flowing waters,
To the fleeing current
He addressed these words:
To the fleeing current
He addressed these words: If you see my country,
My unhappy country,
Go tell my friends
That I remember them.
Go tell my friends
That I remember them. O days so full of charms,
You have vanished...
And my native land, alas!
I will see it no more.
And my native land, alas!
I will see it no more. (Here It Is)
(Here It Is)
Here is your crown And your seal and rings
Here is your love
For all things
Here is your cart Your cardboard and piss
And here is your love
For all of this
May everyone live And may everyone die
Hello, my love
And my love, goodbye
(Here It Is)
(Here It Is)
Here is your wine And your drunken fall
Here is your love
Your love for it all
Here is your sickness Your bed and your pan
Here is your love
For the woman, the man
May everyone live May everyone die
Hello, my love
And, my love, goodbye
(Here It Is)
(Here It Is)
And here is the night The night has begun
And here is your death
In the heart of your son
And here is the dawn (Until death do us part)
And here is your death
In your daughter's heart
May everyone live And may everyone die
Hello, my love
And, my love, goodbye
And may everyone live May everyone die
Hello, my love
And my love, goodbye
(Here It Is)
(Here It Is)
And here you are hurried And here you are gone
And here is the love
It's all built upon
Here is your cross Your nails and your hill
And here is the love
That lists where it will
May everyone live
And may everyone die
Hello, my love
And my love, goodbye
And may everyone live
May everyone die
Hello, my love
And my love, Goodbye
(Here It Is)

(Here It Is) Say a prayer for the cowboy, his mare's run away
And he'll walk 'til he finds her, his darling, his stray
But the river's in flood and the roads are awash
And the bridges break up in the panic of loss And there's nothing to follow, there's nowhere to go
She's gone like the summer, gone like the snow
And the crickets are breaking his heart with their song
As the day caves in and the night is all wrong Did he dream, was it she who went galloping past?
And bent down the fern, broke open the grass
And printed the mud with the iron and the gold
That he nailed to her feet when he was the lord And although she goes grazing a minute away
He tracks her all night, he tracks her all day
Oh, blind to her presence, except to compare
His injury here with her punishment there Then at home on a branch, in the highest tree
A songbird sings out, so suddenly
Ah, the sun is warm and the soft winds ride
On the willow trees by the river side Oh, the world is sweet, the world is wide
And she's there where the light and the darkness divide
And the steam's coming off her, she's huge and she's shy
And she steps on the moon when she paws at the sky And she comes to his hand but she's not really tame
She longs to be lost, he longs for the same
And she'll bolt and she'll plunge through the first open pass
To roll and to feed in the sweet mountain grass Or she'll make a break for the high plateau
Where there's nothing above and there's nothing below
And it's time for the burden, it's time for the whip
Will she walk through the flame? Can he shoot from the hip? So he binds himself to the galloping mare
And she binds herself to the rider there
And there is no space but there's left and right
And there is no time but there's day and night And he leans on her neck and he whispers low
"Whither thou goest, I will go"
And they turn as one and they head for the plain
No need for the whip, ah, no need for the rein Now the clasp of this union, who fastens it tight?
Who snaps it asunder the very next night?
Some say the rider, some say the mare
Or that love's like the smoke, beyond all repair But my darling says, "Leonard, just let it go by
That old silhouette on the great Western sky?
So I pick out a tune and they move right along
And they're gone like the smoke
And they're gone like this song I stumbled out of bed
I got ready for the struggle
I smoked a cigarette
And I tightened up my gut
I said this can't be me
Must be my double
And I can't forget, I can't forget
I can't forget but I don't remember what I'm burning up the road
I'm heading down to Phoenix
I got this old address
Of someone that I knew
It was high and fine and free
Ah, you should have seen us
And I can't forget, I can't forget
I can't forget but I don't remember who I'll be there today
With a big bouquet of cactus
I got this rig that runs on memories
And I promise, cross my heart,
They'll never catch us
But if they do, just tell them it was me Yeah I loved you all my life
And that's how I want to end it
The summer's almost gone
The winter's tuning up
Yeah, the summer's gone
But a lot goes on forever
And I can't forget, I can't forget
I can't forget but I don't remember what Wither Thou goest - I will go.
Wither Thou lodgest - I will lodge.
Thy people shall be - My people - own.
Wither Thou goest - I will go. Wither Thou goest - I will go.
Wither Thou lodgest - I will lodge.
Thy people shall be - My people - own.
Wither Thou goest - I will go. Sometimes I find I get to thinking of the past.
We swore to each other that our love would surely last.
You kept right on loving, I went on a fast,
now I am too thin and your love is too vast. But I know from your eyes
and I know from your smile
that tonight will be fine,
will be fine, will be fine, will be fine
for a while. And I choose the rooms that I live in with care,
the windows are small and the walls almost bare,
there's only one bed and there's only one prayer,
I listen all night for your step on the stair. But I know from your eyes
and I know from your smile
that tonight will be fine,
will be fine, will be fine, will be fine
for a while. Oh sometimes I see her undressing for me,
she's the soft naked lady love meant her to be
and she's moving her body so brave and so free.
If I have got to remember that's a fine memory. And I know from her eyes
and I know from her smile
that tonight will be fine,
will be fine, will be fine, will be fine
for a while. It's coming through a hole in the air,
from those nights in Tiananmen Square.
It's coming from the feel
that this ain't exactly real,
or it's real, but it ain't exactly there.
From the wars against disorder,
from the sirens night and day,
from the fires of the homeless,
from the ashes of the gay:
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. It's coming through a crack in the wall;
on a visionary flood of alcohol;
from the staggering account
of the Sermon on the Mount
which I don't pretend to understand at all.
It's coming from the silence
on the dock of the bay,
from the brave, the bold, the battered
heart of Chevrolet:
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. It's coming from the sorrow in the street,
the holy places where the races meet;
from the homicidal bitchin'
that goes down in every kitchen
to determine who will serve and who will eat.
From the wells of disappointment
where the women kneel to pray
for the grace of God in the desert here
and the desert far away:
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. Sail on, sail on
O mighty Ship of State!
To the Shores of Need
Past the Reefs of Greed
Through the Squalls of Hate
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on. It's coming to America first,
the cradle of the best and of the worst.
It's here they got the range
and the machinery for change
and it's here they got the spiritual thirst.
It's here the family's broken
and it's here the lonely say
that the heart has got to open
in a fundamental way:
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. It's coming from the women and the men.
O baby, we'll be making love again.
We'll be going down so deep
the river's going to weep,
and the mountain's going to shout Amen!
It's coming like the tidal flood
beneath the lunar sway,
imperial, mysterious,
in amorous array:
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. Sail on, sail on ... I'm sentimental, if you know what I mean
I love the country but I can't stand the scene.
And I'm neither left or right
I'm just staying home tonight,
getting lost in that hopeless little screen.
But I'm stubborn as those garbage bags
that Time cannot decay,
I'm junk but I'm still holding up
this little wild bouquet:
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. I knew that it was wrong
I didn't have a doubt
I was dying to get back home
And you were starting out
I said I'd best be moving on
You said we have all day
You smiled at me like I was young
It took my breath away
Your crazy fragrance all around
Your secrets all in view
My lost, my lost was saying found
My don't was saying do Let's keep it on the level
When I walked away from you
I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel, too
They oughta give my heart a medal
For letting go of you
When I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel, too Now I'm living in this temple
Where they tell you what to do
I'm old and I've had to settle
On a different point of view
I was fighting with temptation
But I didn't want to win
A man like me don't like to see
Temptation caving in Your crazy fragrance all around
Your secrets in my view
My lost, my lost was saying found
My don't was saying do Let's keep it on the level
When I walked away from you
I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel, too They oughta give my heart a medal
For letting go of you
When I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel, too They oughta give my heart a medal
For letting go of you
When I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel, too I believe that you heard your master sing
when I was sick in bed.
I suppose that he told you everything
that I keep locked away in my head.
Your master took you travelling,
well at least that's what you said.
And now do you come back to bring
your prisoner wine and bread? You met him at some temple, where
they take your clothes at the door.
He was just a numberless man in a chair
who'd just come back from the war.
And you wrap up his tired face in your hair
and he hands you the apple core.
Then he touches your lips now so suddenly bare
of all the kisses we put on some time before. And he gave you a German Shepherd to walk
with a collar of leather and nails,
and he never once made you explain or talk
about all of the little details,
such as who had a word and who had a rock,
and who had you through the mails.
Now your love is a secret all over the block,
and it never stops not even when your master fails. And he took you up in his aeroplane,
which he flew without any hands,
and you cruised above the ribbons of rain
that drove the crowd from the stands.
Then he killed the lights in a lonely Lane
and, an ape with angel glands,
erased the final wisps of pain
with the music of rubber bands. And now I hear your master sing,
you kneel for him to come.
His body is a golden string
that your body is hanging from.
His body is a golden string,
my body has grown numb.
Oh now you hear your master sing,
your shirt is all undone. And will you kneel beside this bed
that we polished so long ago,
before your master chose instead
to make my bed of snow?
Your eyes are wild and your knuckles are red
and you're speaking far too low.
No I can't make out what your master said
before he made you go. Then I think you're playing far too rough
for a lady who's been to the moon;
I've lain by this window long enough
to get used to an empty room.
And your love is some dust in an old man's cough
who is tapping his foot to a tune,
and your thighs are a ruin, you want too much,
let's say you came back some time too soon. I loved your master perfectly
I taught him all that he knew.
He was starving in some deep mystery
like a man who is sure what is true.
And I sent you to him with my guarantee
I could teach him something new,
and I taught him how you would long for me
no matter what he said no matter what you'd do. I believe that you heard your master sing
while I was sick in bed,
I'm sure that he told you everything
I must keep locked away in my head.
Your master took you travelling,
well at least that's what you said,
And now do you come back to bring
your prisoner wine and bread? It's not the wind that keeps you up it's not the snow
It's not the moon coming like a headlight through your window
It's not the thumbnail of a screen that scrapes away your dream
It's just a man taking what he needs from the store room It's not the news of burning towns that ruins your mind
Like a spool you turn and you turn but it won't unwind
No these wars you did not start they don't tear your sleep apart
It's just a man taking what he needs from the store room And now this woman by your side well she's asleep
And there's nothing you can give her and there's nothing you want to keep
You don't even try to prove that the noisy neighbour's making love
It's just a man taking what he needs from the store room Well go to sleep and change the locks when you wake up
Share your toast maybe spill some coffee from your cup
There's nothing left to choose and there is so much more to lose
There's this man taking what he needs from the store room It's not the news of burning towns that ruins your mind
Like a spool you turn and you turn but it won't unwind
No these wars you did not stop they don't tear your sleep apart
It's just a man taking what he needs from the store room And now this woman by your side well she's awake
But there's nothing you can give her there's nothing you want to take
You don't even try to prove that the noisy neighbour's making love
It's just a man taking what he needs from the store room Well go to sleep and change the locks when you wake up
Share your toast maybe spill a little coffee from your cup
He's got nothing left to choose and you've got so much more to lose
There's a man taking what he needs from the store room Steer your way past the ruins of the altar and the mall
Steer your way through fables of creation and the fall
Steer your way past the palaces that rise above the rot
Year by year, month by month, day by day
Thought by thought Steer your heart past the truth that you believed in yesterday
Such as fundamental goodness and the wisdom of the way
Steer your heart, precious heart, past the women whom you bought
Year by year, month by month, day by day
Thought by thought
Steer you way through the pain that is far more real than you
That's smashed the cosmic model, that blinded every view
And please don't make me go there, though there be a God or not
Year by year, month by month, day by day
Thought by thought They whisper still, the injured stones
The blunted mountains weep
As he died to make men holy
Let us die to make things cheap
And the Mea Culpa, which you probably forgot
Year by year, month by month, day by day
Thought by thought Steer your way, O my heart, though I have no right to ask
To the one who was never, never equal to the task
Who knows he's been convicted, who knows he will be shot
Year by year, month by month, day by day
Thought by thought They whisper still, the injured stones
The blunted mountains weep
As he died to make men holy
Let us die to make things cheap
And the Mea Culpa, which you gradually forgot
Year by year, month by month, day by day
Thought by thought Did I ever love you
Did I ever need you
Did I ever fight you
Did I ever want you
Did I ever leave you
Was I ever able
Or are we still leaning
Across the old table Did I ever love you
Did I ever need you
Did I ever fight you
Did I ever want you
Did I ever leave you
Was I ever able
Are we still leaning
Across the old table Was it ever settled
Was it ever over
And is it still raining
Back in November
The lemon trees blossom
The almond trees wither
Was I ever someone
Who could love you forever Was it ever settled
Was it ever over
And is it still raining
Back in November
The lemon trees blossom
The almond trees wither
Its spring and its summer
And its winter forever Did I ever love you
Does it really matter
Did I ever fight you
There's no need to answer
Did I ever leave you
Was I ever able
And are we still leaning
Across the old table Did I ever love you
Did I ever need you
Did I ever fight you
Did I ever want you
Did I ever leave you
Was I ever able
Are we still leaning
Across the old table Did I ever love you
Did I ever need you
Did I ever fight you
Did I ever want you
Did I ever leave you
Was I ever able
Are we still leaning
Across the old table Maybe I'm still hurting
I can't turn the other cheek
But you know that I still love you
It's just that I can't speak
I looked for you in everyone
And they called me on that too
I lived alone but I was only
Coming back to you Ah they're shutting down the factory now
Just when all the bills are due
And the fields they're under lock and key
Tho' the rain and the sun come through
And springtime starts but then it stops
In the name of something new
And all the senses rise against this
Coming back to you And they're handing down my sentence now
And I know what I must do
Another mile of silence while I'm
Coming back to you There are many in your life
And many still to be
Since you are a shining light
There's many that you'll see
But I have to deal with envy
When you choose the precious few
Who've left their pride on the other side of
Coming back to you Even in your arms I know
I'll never get it right
Even when you bend to give me
Comfort in the night
I've got to have your word on this
Or none of it is true
And all I've said was just instead of
Coming back to you Ah the man she wanted all her life was hanging by a thread
"I never even knew how much I wanted you," she said
His muscles, they were numbered, and his style was obsolete
"Oh bay, I have come too late."
She knelt beside his feet "I'll never see a face like yours in years of men to come
I'll never see such arms again in wrestling or love."
And all his virtues burning in the smokey holocaust
She took unto herself most everything her lover lost Now the master of this landscape, he was standing at the view
With a sparrow of st. francis that he was preaching to
She beckoned to the sentry of his high religious mood
She said, "I'll make a place between my legs, I'll teach you solitude." He offered her an orgy in a many mirrored room
He promiised her protection for the issue of her womb
She moved her body hard against a sharpened metal spoon
She stopped the bloody rituals of passage to the moon She took his much admired oriental frame of mind
And the heart-of-darkness alibi his money hides behind
She took his blonde madonna and his monastery wine
"This mental space is occupied and everything is mine.2 He tried to make a final stand beside the railway track
She said, "The art of longing's over and it's never coming back."
She took his tavern parliament, his cap, his cocky dance
She mocked his female fashions and his working-class moustache The last time that I saw him he was trying hard to get
A woman's education, but he's not a woman yet
And the last time that I saw her she was living with a boy
Who gives her soul an empty room and gives her body joy So the great affair is over, but whoever would have guessed
It would leave us all so vacant and so deeply unimpressed
It's like our visit to the moon or to that other star
I guess you go for nothing if you really want to go that far O Crown of Light, O Darkened One
I never thought we d meet
You kiss my lips and then it s done
I m back on Boogie Street A sip of wine, a cigarette and then it s time to go
I tidied up the kitchenette, I tuned the old banjo
I m wanted at the traffic-jam, they re saving me a seat
I m what I am, and what I am is back on Boogie Street And O my love, I still recall the pleasures that we knew
The rivers and the waterfall, wherein I bathed with you
Bewildered by your beauty there, I d kneel to dry your feet
By such instructions you prepare a man for Boogie Street O Crown of Light, O Darkened One
I never thought we d meet
You kiss my lips and then it s done
And I m back, back on Boogie Street So come, my friends, be not afraid, we are so lightly here
It is in love that we are made, in love we disappear
Though all the maps of blood and flesh are posted on the door
There s no one who has told us yet what Boogie Street is for O Crown of Light, O Darkened One
I never thought we d meet
You kiss my lips, and then it s done
And I m back, back on Boogie Street A sip of wine, a cigarette and then it s time to go
I tidied up the kitchenette, I tuned the old banjo
I m wanted at the traffic-jam, they re saving me a seat
I m what I am, and what I am is back on Boogie Street Show me the place, where you want your slave to go
Show me the place, I've forgotten I don't know
Show me the place, for my head is bending low
Show me the place, where you want your slave to go Show me the place, help me roll away the stone
Show me the place, I can't move this thing alone
Show me the place where the word became command
Show me the place where the suffering began The troubles came I saved what I could save
A thread of light, a particle away
But there were chains so I hastened to behave
There were chains, so I loved you like a slave Show me the place, where you want your slave to go
Show me the place, I've forgotten I don't know
Show me the place, for my head is bending low
Show me the place, where you want your slave to go The troubles came I saved what I could save
A thread of light, a particle away
But there were chains so I hastened to behave
There were chains so I loved you like a slave Show me the place
Show me the place
Show me the place Show me the place, help me roll away the stone
Show me the place, I can't move this thing alone
Show me the place where the word became command
Show me the place where the suffering began You were the promise at dawn,
I was the morning after.
You were Jesus Christ my Lord,
I was the money lender.
You were the sensitive woman,
I was the very reverend Freud.
You were the manual orgasm,
I was the dirty little boy. And is this what you wanted
To live in a house that is haunted
By the ghost of you and me? Is this what you wanted ...
To live in a house that is haunted
By the ghost of you and me? You were Marlon Brando,
I was Steve McQueen.
You were K.Y. Jelly,
I was Vaseline.
You were the father of modern medicine,
I was Mr. Clean.
You where the whore and the beast of Babylon,
I was Rin Tin Tin.
And is this what you wanted ...
To live in a house that is haunted
By the ghost of you and me?
And is this what you wanted
To live in a house that is haunted
By the ghost of you and me? You got old and wrinkled,
I stayed seventeen.
You lusted after so many,
I lay here with one.
You defied your solitude,
I came through alone.
You said you could never love me,
I undid your gown. And is this what you wanted ...
To live in a house that is haunted
By the ghost of you and me?
And is this what you wanted
To live in a house that is haunted
By the ghost of you and me?
I mean is this what you wanted ...
To live in a house that is haunted
By the ghost of you and me? That's right, is this what you wanted ... Now the Captain called me to his bed
He fumbled for my hand
"Take these silver bars," he said
"I'm giving you command."
"Command of what, there's no one here
There's only you and me --
All the rest are dead or in retreat
Or with the enemy." "Complain, complain, that's all you've done
Ever since we lost
If it's not the Crucifixion
Then it's the Holocaust."
"May Christ have mercy on your soul
For making such a joke
Amid these hearts that burn like coal
And the flesh that rose like smoke." "I know that you have suffered, lad,
But suffer this awhile:
Whatever makes a soldier sad
Will make a killer smile."
"I'm leaving, Captain, I've got to go
There's blood upon your hand
But tell me, Captain, if you know
Of a decent place to stand." "There is no decent place to stand
In a massacre;
But if a woman take your hand
Then go and stand with her."
"I left a wife in Tennessee
And a baby in Saigon --
I risked my life, but not to hear
Some country-western song." "Ah but if you cannot raise your love
To a very high degree,
Then you're just the man I've been thinking of --
So come and stand with me."
"Your standing days are done," I cried,
"You'll rally me no more.
I don't even know what side
We fought on, or what for." "I'm on the side that's always lost
Against the side of Heaven
I'm on the side of Snake-eyes tossed
Against the side of Seven.
And I've read the Bill of Human Rights
And some of it was true
But there wasn't any burden left
So I'm laying it on you." Now the Captain he was dying
But the Captain wasn't hurt
The silver bars were in my hand
Pinned them to my shirt. Seemed the better way
When first I heard him speak
Now it's much to late
To turn the other cheek
Sounded like the truth
Seemed the better way
Sounded like the truth
But it's not the truth today I wonder what it was
I wonder what it meant
First he touched on love
Then he touched on death
Sounded like the truth
Seemed the better way
Sounded like the truth
But it's not the truth today
I better hold my tongue
I better take my place
Lift this glass of blood
Try to say the grace Seemed the better way
When first I heard him speak
But now it's much to late
To turn the other cheek
Sounded like the truth
Seemed the better way
Sounded like the truth
But it's not the truth today I better hold my tongue
I better take my place
Lift this glass of blood
Try to say the grace I said I'd be your lover
You laughed at what I said
I lost my job forever
I was counted with the dead I swept the marble chambers
But you sent me down below
You kept me from believing
Until you let me know That I am not the one who loves
It's love that seizes me
When hatred with his package comes
You forbid delivery And when the hunger for your touch
Rises from the hunger
You whisper, "You have loved enough
Now let me be the lover" And when the hunger for your touch
Rises from the hunger
You whisper, "You have loved enough
Now let me be the lover" I swept the marble chambers
But you sent me down below
You kept me from believing
Until you let me know That I am not the one who loves
It's love that chooses me
When hatred with his package comes
You forbid delivery And when the hunger for your touch
Rises from the hunger
You whisper, "You have loved enough
Now let me be the lover"
... Suddenly the night has grown colder
The god of love preparing to depart
Alexandra hoisted on his shoulder
They slip between the sentries of the heart Upheld by the simplicities of pleasure
They gain the light, they formlessly entwine
And radiant beyond your widest measure
They fall among the voices and the wine It's not a trick, your senses all deceiving
A fitful dream, the morning will exhaust
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this As someone long prepared for this to happen
Go firmly to the window. Drink it in
Exquisite music. Alexandra laughing
Your first commitments tangible again And you who had the honor of her evening
And by that honor had your own restored
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Alexandra leaving with her lord Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this As someone long prepared for the occasion
In full command of every plan you wrecked
Do not choose a coward's explanation
That hides behind the cause and the effect And you who were bewildered by a meaning
Whose code was broken, crucifix uncrossed
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost The light came through the window
Straight from the sun above
And so inside my little room
There plunged the rays of love In streams of light I clearly saw
The dust you seldom see
Out of which the nameless makes
A name for one like me I'll try to say a little more
Love went on and on
Until it reached an open door -
Then love itself
Love itself was gone All busy in the sunlight
The flecks did float and dance
And I was tumbled up with them
In formless circumstance I'll try to say a little more
Love went on and on
Until it reached an open door -
Then love itself
Love itself was gone Then I came back from where I'd been
My room, it looked the same -
But there was nothing left between
The nameless and the name
(Nameless and the name) All busy in the sunlight
The flecks did float and dance
And I was tumbled up with them
In formless circumstance I'll try to say a little more
Love went on and on
Until it reached an open door -
Then love itself
Love itself was gone
Love itself
Love itself was gone Because of a few songs
Wherein I spoke of their mystery,
Women have been
Exceptionally kind
to my old age.
They make a secret place
In their busy lives
And they take me there.
They become naked
In their different ways
and they say,
"Look at me, Leonard
Look at me one last time."
Then they bend over the bed
And cover me up
Like a baby that is shivering. I lit a thin green candle to make you jealous of me.
But the room just filled up with mosquitos
They heard that my body was free.
Then I took the dust of a long sleepless night
And I have put it in your little shoe.
And then I confess that I tortured the dress
That you wore for the world to look through.
I showed my heart to the doctor: he said I just have to quit. Then he wrote himself a prescription
Your name was mentioned in it!
Then he locked himself to a library shelf
With the details of our honeymoon
And I heard from the nurse, that he's gotten much worse
And his practice has fallen into ruin.
And I heard of a saint who'd loved you, and I studied all night in his school.
He taught that the duty of lovers Is to tarnish the golden rule.
And just when I was sure that his teachings were pure
He drowned himself in the pool.
His body is gone, but back here on the lawn
his spirit continues to drool.
An Eskimo showed me a movie, he'd recently taken of you:
The poor man could hardly stop shivering
His lips, his fingers were blue. I suppose he froze when the wind took your cloth
And I guess he just never got warm.
But you stand there so nice, in your blizzard of ice
oh please let me come into the storm. Now why do you stand by the window
Abandoned to beauty and pride
The thorn of the night in your bosom
The spear of the age in your side? Lost in the rages of fragrance
Lost in the rags of remorse
Lost in the waves of the sickness
That loosens the high silver nerves Oh chosen love, oh frozen love
Oh tangle of matter and ghost
Oh darling of angels, demons and saints
And the whole broken-hearted host, gentle this soul And come forth from your cloud of unknowing
And kiss the cheek of the moon
The new Jerusalem glowing
Why tarry all night in this ruin? And leave no word of discomfort
Or leave no observer to mourn
But climb on your tears and be silent
Like the rose on its ladder of thorns Oh chosen love, oh frozen love
Oh tangle of matter and ghost
Oh darling of angels, demons and saints
And the whole broken-hearted host, gentle this soul Then lay your rose on the fire
The fire give up to the sun
The sun give over to splendor
In the arms of the high holy one For the holy one dreams of a letter
Dreams of a letter's death
Bless thee continuous stutter
Of the word being made into flesh Oh chosen love, oh frozen love
Oh tangle of matter and ghost
Oh darling of angels, demons and saints
And the whole broken-hearted host, gentle this soul, gentle this soul Oh chosen love, oh frozen love
Oh tangle of matter and ghost
Oh darling of angels, demons and saints
And the whole broken-hearted host, gentle this soul, gentle this soul I cannot follow you, my love
You cannot follow me
I am the distance you put between
All of the moments that we will be You know who I am
You've stared at the sun
Well I am the one who loves
Changing from nothing to one Sometimes I need you naked
Sometimes I need you wild
I need you to carry my children in
And I need you to kill a child You know who I am
You've stared at the sun
Well I am the one who loves
Changing from nothing to one If you should ever track me down
I will surrender there
And I will leave with you one broken man
Whom I will teach you to repair You know who I am
You've stared at the sun
Well I am the one who loves
Changing from nothing to one I cannot follow you, my love
You cannot follow me
I am the distance you put between
All of the moments that we will be You know who I am
You've stared at the sun
Well I am the one who loves
Changing from nothing to one One by one the guests arrive
The guests are coming through
The open-hearted many
The broken-hearted few And no one knows where the night is going
And no one knows where the wine is flowing
Oh love, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you now And those who dance, begin to dance
Those who weep, begin
And welcome, welcome cries a voice
Let all my guests come in And no one knows where the night is going
And no one knows where the wine is flowing
Oh love, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you now And all go stumbling through that house
In lonely secrecy
Saying, "do reveal yourself"
or "why has thou forsaken me" And no one knows where the night is going
And no one knows where the wine is flowing
Oh love, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you now All at once the torches flare
The inner door flies open
One by one they enter there
In every style of passion And no one knows where the night is going
And no one knows where the wine is flowing
Oh love, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you now And here they take their sweet repast
While house and grounds resolve
And one by one the guests are cast beyond the garden wall And no one knows where the night is going
And no one knows where the wine is flowing
Oh love, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you now For those who dance, begin to dance
Those who weep, begin
Those who earnestly are lost
Are lost, and lost again And no one knows where the night is going
And no one knows where the wine is flowing
Oh love, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you now
One by one the guests arrive
The guests are coming through
The broken-hearted many
The open-hearted few
And no one knows where the night is going
And no one knows where the wine is flowing
Oh love, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
I need you now It? s going to happen very soon
The great event, which will end the horror
Which will end the sorrow
Next Tuesday when the sun goes down I will play the Moonlight Sonata backwards
This will reverse the effects of the world? s mad plunge
Into suffering, for the last 200 million years
What a lovely night that would be What a sigh of relief, as the senile robins
Become bright red again, and the retired nightingales
Pick up their dusty tails, and assert the Majesty of Creation I saw some people starving
There was murder, there was rape
Their villages were burning
They were trying to escape I couldn't meet their glances
I was staring at my shoes
It was acid, it was tragic
It was almost like the blues
It was almost like the blues I have to die a little
between each murderous plot
and when I'm finished thinking
I have to die a lot There's torture, and there's killing
and there's all my bad reviews
The war, the children missing, lord
It's almost like the blues
It's almost like the blues Though I let my heart get frozen
to keep away the rot
my father says I'm chosen
my mother says I'm not I listened to their story
of the gypsies and the Jews
It was good, it wasn't boring
It was almost like the blues
It was almost like the blues There is no God in heaven
There is no hell below
So says the great professor
of all there is to know But I've had the invitation
that a sinner can't refuse
It's almost like salvation
It's almost like the blues
It's almost like the blues Almost like the blues Almost like the blues Almost like the blues

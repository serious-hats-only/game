"I like Lou Reed," she said, sticking her tongue in my ear.
"Let's go, let's sit, let's talk, politics goes so good with beer.

And a comb in her pocket if the wind get blown.
Stripes on her eyes when she walks slow,

This fly, fly, c'mon Your head can go real screw
With saucers chasing you The day since I met her
I - can't believe it's true
She came here from Memphis
Across the ocean sailing
And I saw her
And I pleaded
Why do you come so far?
And she said Trying to get to you
How I tried to get you
Trying to get you I'm sending a letter
I'll - send it right to you
I'll send it to Memphis
I know that someday
Everything I needed
And I wanted
Used to be that my head
Was haunted And all these sirens
They make me mad
And all this violence
It brings me down
I feel strong
I feel lucky Trying to get to you
Said I'm going to get to you
Trying to get to you {This is a song about a superhero named Tony
It's called Tony's theme}
He's got the oil on his [incomprehensible]
For a ride in the rain
No baloney
Ride around on my bicycle like a pony
I'm waving hi, hi, hi
G-g-gimme, a scream
Give me, give me the theme
Of Tony
Tony, Tony, Tony
Tony
[incomprehensible] super bicycle [incomprehensible], I'm racing
Spitfire turn and pop a wheelie, burn evil chasing
I'm waving bye, bye, bye
I got a card in my spokes
I'm practicing my joke, I'm learning
Tony, Tony, Tony
Tony, Tony
{This is a song about a superhero named Tony
It's called Tony's theme}
I can look at the sun if you give me some bad sun glasses
I'm back on the road, I cut my grass like I'm told
After classes

'Less your flying by
Just sitting there square
Baking in the sun
Beneath the sky They're gonna put it down
Right on the strip
They're gonna put it down
On the Vegas strip
They're gonna put it down
And step outside
Into the lights
Right outta that ship
Saying hi! I was driving doing nothing on the shores of Great Salt Lake
When they put it on the air, I put it in the hammer lane
I soon forgot myeslf and I forgot about the brake
I forgot all laws and I forgot about the rain
They were talking on the 9 and all across the army band
Across the road they were turning around and headed south with me It got so crowded on the road, I started driving in the sand
My head was feeling scared but my heart was feeling free
The desert turned to mud it seems that everybody heard
Everybody was remembering to forget they had the chills Then I heard the voices on a broadcast from up on the bird
They were getting interviewed by some goodman whose name was Bill
I'm almost there to Vegas where they're puttin' on a show
They've come so far, I've lived this long, at least I must just go and say
Hello From distant star to this here bar
The me, the you, where are we now?
Hooray the blues of everyone

Keeps a smile around a while
He took no fright and jettisoned

I saw the face of Allison

He tried hard but could not make it
Last night he could not make it On a holiday, for many miles
Looking for a place to stay
Near some friendly star, he found this mote
And now we wonder where we are How could this so great turn so shitty
He ended up in army crates
And photographs in files, his tiny boat
Sparked as he turned to grazed our city I started driving on the motorway
I was feeling down Last night he could not make it
Last night he could not make it
He tried hard but could not make it
Last night he could not make it On a holiday, for many miles

You can often find her kneeling inside of her hole
And I often ask her "Are you looking for the mother lode?"
No, no my child, this is not my desire and then she said "I'm digging for fire
I'm digging for fire
I'm digging for fire
I'm digging for fire" There is this old man who has spent so much of his life sleeping
That he is able to keep awake for the rest of his years
He resides, on a beach, in a town where I am going to live
And I often ask him "Are you looking for the mother lode?"
No, no my child, this is not my desire and then he said "I'm digging for fire
I'm digging for fire

Build high, build high
Build high, build high Hold me up with pride

It's not time for me to go...
It's not time for me to go... My eyes have turned, just the color of diamonds.
Just the color, the frayed color of ice...
My eyes have turned, just the color of diamonds.
Just the color, the frayed color of ice... I'm not together and you know it's true
My bits all wander in the trees
And if I ever seem a little strange
Would you excuse me please I said I'm human but you know I lied
I'm only visiting this shore
I'll soon be leaving in the outbound tide
I pray again we will meet I'm wasting your time just talking to you
Maybe best you go on home
I'll leave you alone, fade from your mind
Slip into the greens and blues I said I'm human but you know I lied
I'm only visiting this shore
I'll soon be leaving in the outbound tide
I pray again we will meet I'm wasting your time just talking to you
Maybe best you go on home
I'll leave you alone, fade from your mind
Slip into the greens and blues Greens and blues

Slip into the greens and blues Greens and blues Ring the bells
Ring the bells
Don't drink coffee
Some call me Shell
Even now
Even now
My heart is empty
There comes the storm(?) I wheel away a mountain
And though I've had some good times
I wouldn't have payed a coin
To see the garden once more I've been up here a long time
And now I see it's high time
To see the gardens once more
To walk with you once more Ring the bells
Ring the bells
Don't drink coffee
Some call me Shell
Even now
Even now
My heart is empty
There comes the storm(?) Ring the bell
Ring the bell
I've been right here a long time
And now I see it's hightime
To see the garden once more To walk with you once more
I've been away a long time
And though it's been a good time
I won't pay the toll to see the garden once more Ring the bells
Ring the bells
Don't drink coffee
Some call me Shell
Even now
Even now
My heart is empty
There comes the storm(?) I was driving doing nothing
On the shores of Great Salt Lake
When they put it on the air
I put it in the hammer lane
I soon forgot myself
And I forgot about the brake
I forgot about all laws
And I forgot about the rain
They were talking on the 9
And all across the amy band
Across the road they were turning around
And headed south with me
It got so crowded on the road
I started driving in the sand
My head was feeling scared
But my heart was feeling free
The desert turned to mud
It seems that everybody heard
Everybody was remembering
To forget they had the chills Then I heard the voices on a broadcast
From up on the bird
They were getting interviewed
By some good man whose name was Bill I'm almost there to Vegas
Where they're puttin' on a show
They've come so far
I've lived this long, at least
I must just go and say hello In this land of strangers
There are dangers
(There are dangers)
There are sorrows
I can't see this lady
It is shady
I am leavin' tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow Even there's a reason
It's silver
It's gone
In this land of strangers
There are dangers
(There are dangers)
There are sorrows
Sorrows
Sorrows
Sorrows 
 As loud as hell, a ringing bell
Behind my smile it shakes my teeth
And all the while, as vampires feed
I bleed, I bleed, I bleed Prithee, my dear, why are we here?
Nobody knows, we go to sleep
As breathing flows, my mind secedes
I bleed, I bleed, I bleed, I bleed, I bleed, I bleed There's a place in the buried west in a cave
With a house in it in the clay
The holes of hands, you can place a hand in hand
I bleed, I bleed, I bleed I'm the hard loser
You'll find me crashing through my mother's door.
I am the ugly lover
You'll find us rolling on the dirty floor. Break my body, hold my bones, hold my bones
Break my body, hold my bones, hold my bones
Break my body, hold my bones, hold my bones I'm a belly dancer
I'll shake forever and I never care.
I'm a building jumper
Roof to roof, you see me flying in the air. Break my body, hold my bones, hold my bones
Break my body, hold my bones, hold my bones
Break my body, hold my bones, hold my bones, bones Somebody got hurt, somebody get hurt, somebody got hurt I waited for you winterlong
You seemed to be where I belong
It's all illusion anyway If things should ever turn out wrong
And all the love we have is gone
It won't be easy on that day Waiting to follow
Through the dream light of your way
Is not so easy for me now After time has passed your way
Things we thought of yesterday
Come back now
Come back now, woah Waiting to follow
Through the dream light of your way
Is not so easy for me now After time has passed your way
Things we thought of yesterday
Come back now
Come back now, woah I waited for you winterlong
You seemed to be where I belong
I waited for you winterlong
You seemed to be where I belong
I waited for you winterlong
You seemed to be where I belong
I waited for you winterlong
You seemed to be where I belong On my way back to one
I fell sleep with a loaded gun
In a room with a light bulb sun
Ain't no place far too high
Add an orgy of rooms and vibes
And the sea of the suicides
Follow me, see my silver trails
Blessed me, when is a snail a tail
I am the silver snail
On my way back to one
On my way back to seventh sun
Then I count to a million
It will awake from his dream
Find his way in these honey mumz
Find a way to the dream of dreams
Silver spoons for my silver snails
Like harpoons for the killer wales
I am the silver snail
On my way back to one
Often sleep with a loaded gun
In a room with a light bulb sun
On my way back to one
Often sleep with a loaded gun
In a room with a light bulb sun One, two, three, four My father lives in Arabia
And I live right here at my school
I took his plane to Colombia
So I could sell at my school It's weird at my school
It's weird at my school
It's weird at my school
It's weird at my school My mother's glad that I am here
So she can visit my school
I can't believe she's so pretty
I'm a son of a bitch at my school Weird at my school
It's weird at my school
It's weird at my school
It's weird at my school And my best friend, my cousin Eleanor
She lives far away from the doors of my school
And often times, you know I fantasize
That I have sex with the nuns at my school It's weird at my school
It's weird at my school
It's weird at my school
It's weird at my school It's weird at my school
It's weird at my school
It's weird at my school
It's weird at my school Upon construction

You wouldn't know that something's even on
And when you're lying on the silver tracks
No difference to me You don't know that you're a sacrifice
All my love has turned back into ice
People, when the sky is turning black
You'll know that it's me Are you saving?
Are you saving it for me?
Are you saving all your precious love for me?
Are you saving?

Make it better for today If I could go to the beginning
I would be another way
Make it better for today

In the lake that's like an ocean
I count about a billion head
All the time, there's a motion Palace of the brine
Palace of the brine I saw the cloning
Of the famous family
I hear the droning
In the shrine of the sea monkey Palace of the brine
Palace of the brine Beneath reflections in the fountain
The starry sky in Utah mountains
They are swimming happily
Can't you see? A life that's so sublime
Palace of the brine With a pet at my side
God in the sky
Snow falling down
Freeze my body to the ground
I can't ride
But one more time
I will ride
All over the world Washed over the side
Top of the sky
Slow diver down
Two feet land on a different fround
You can't live easily
You can't even speak
But all of them speak
All over the world I will meet you over there
I am going to meet you over there
Washed over the side
Top of the sky
Slow diver down
Two feet land on a different ground
You can't live easily
You can't even speak
Fish all of them speak
All over the world A plain with no herd
Not even a bird
When one side is hot
The other side of the moon is not
It's just like a ride
Maybe some time
They'll make it a ride
All over the world I will meet you over there
I am going to meet you over there Time is an arrangement
Time is an arranger
I am a derangement All my thoughts
All I am are my thoughts
All my thoughts
I am all what I'm taught Better call the ranger
Got a train derailment
Better call the ranger What I'm taught
All I am are my thoughts
All my thoughts
All I am are my thoughts
What I'm not I was born in Chicago
1971
I was born in Chicago 1970
What my father told me,
"Son, you'd better get a gun."
My first friend went down
When I was 16 years old
Oh my first friend went down
When I was 16 years old
There's one thing I can say about that boy
He gotta go
My second friend went down
When I was 17 years of age
Oh my second friend went down
When I was 17 years of age
There's one thing I can say about that boy
He gotta pray
Oh life is a lie
If you don't know how to play the game
Oh life is a lie
If you don't know how to play the game
All my friends are going
And everything's gonna stay the same [instrumental] I got a broken face, I got a...
I got a broken face, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, un-huh, ooh...
I got a broken face...
I got a broken face...
I got a broken face... There was this boy who had two children with his sisters,
Who were his daughters, who were his favorite lovers. I got no lips, I got no tongue,
Where there were eyes, there's only space.
I got no lips, I got no tongue. I got a broken face, uh-huh, uh-huh...
I got a broken face... There was this man who snapped his brain in little pieces,
And then they drilled holes, and then they put 'em back in there. I got no lips, I got no tongue,
Where there were eyes, there's only space.
I got no lips, I got no tongue. I got a broken face, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, ooh...
I got a broken face... The little thing who does my laundry speaks no English,
But if you saw her, you'd say, "Isn't she lovely?" I got no lips, I got no tongue,
Where there were eyes, there's only space.
I got no lips, I got no tongue. The drumsticks were his treasure trove
Found in the ashes of The Coconut Grove Hey, man, can you give me something?
Hey, man, did you give me something?
Hey, man, nothing comes from nothing
Hey, man, something came from somewhere Hey, man, it's a tenement song
It's there on the tip of your tongue
Let's play on a tenement song
On and on and on Tenement song
It's a tenement song Tall bottle and one more smoke
Tenement song
She lived through the fire but the piano got broke
It's a tenement song Hey, man, can you give me something?
Hey, man, did you give me something? Hey, man, it's a tenement song
It's there on the tip of your tongue
Let's play on a tenement song
On and on and on Hey, man, it's a tenement song,
It's there on the tip of your tongue,
Let's play on a tenement song
On and on and on
On and on and on

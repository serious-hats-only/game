In Napoli where love is king
When boy meets girl, here's what they say: When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's amore
When the world seems to shine like you've had too much wine, that's amore
Bells will ring ting-a-ling-a-ling, ting-a-ling-a-ling, and you'll sing, "Vita bella"
Hearts will play tippy-tippy-tay, tippy-tippy-tay, like a gay tarantella When the stars make you drool just like a pasta e fazool, that's amore
When you dance down the street with a cloud at your feet, you're in love
When you walk in a dream but you know you're not dreaming signore
Scuzzi me, but you see, back in old Napoli that's amore When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's amore
(That's amore)
When the world seems to shine like you've had too much wine, that's amore
(That's amore) Bells will ring (Ting-a-ling-a-ling), ting-a-ling-a-ling
(And you'll sing "Vita bella") Vita bell, vita bella
Hearts will play (Tippy-tippy-tay, tippy-tippy-tay), like a gay tarantella

When you dance down the street with a cloud at your feet, you're in love When you walk in a dream, but you know you're not dreaming signore
Scusami, but you see, back in old Napoli that's amore (Amore)
That's amore Let me tell ya 'bout the birds and the bees
And the flowers and the trees
And the moon up above
And a thing called 'Love' Let me tell ya 'bout the stars in the sky
And a girl and a guy
And the way they could kiss
On a night like this When I look into your big brown eyes
It's so very plain to see
That it's time you learned about the facts of life
Starting from A to Z Let me tell ya 'bout the birds and the bees
And the flowers and the trees
And the moon up above
And a thing called 'Love'
(Yeah) When I look into your big brown eyes
It's so very plain to see
That it's time you learned about the facts of life

And the flowers and the trees

And the flowers and the trees, 'bout the birds And the bees
And the bees
And the bees
... When marimba rhythms start to play Dance with me, make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more
Like a flower bending in the breeze Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me
Other dancers may be on the floor Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway I go weak
I can hear the sounds of violins Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now
Other dancers may be on the floor Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway I go weak

buona Sera senorina kiss me good night I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air
They fly so high, nearly reach the sky
Then like my dreams they fade and die Fortune's always hiding
I've looked everywhere
I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air I'm f-f-forever b-b-blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air
They f-f-fly so high, nearly reach the sky
Then in my d-d-dreams they fade and d-d-die Fortune's always hiding
I've looked everywhere
I'm f-f-forever b-b-blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles, no more troubles
Pretty bubbles in the air Everybody loves somebody sometime
Everybody falls in love somehow
Something in your kiss just told me
My sometime is now Everybody finds somebody someplace
There's no telling where love may appear
Something in my heart keeps saying
My someplace is here If I had it in my power
I'd arrange for every girl to have your charms
Then every minute, every hour
Every boy would find what I found in your arms Everybody loves somebody sometime
And although my dream was overdue
Your love made it well worth waiting
For someone like you If I had it in my power
I would arrange for every girl to have your charms
Then every minute, every hour
Every boy would find what I found in your arms Everybody loves somebody sometime
And although my dream was overdue
Your love made it well worth waiting
For someone like you
(Everybody loves somebody sometime) (A boy went back to Napoli, because he missed the scenery)
(the native dances and the charming songs, but wait a minute --)

Stretti stretti co 'na pupa bella passeggiar
Sotto'er celo de Roma Down each avenue or via, street or strata
You can see 'em disappearing, two-by-two
On an evening in Roma Do they take 'em for espresso, yeah, I guess so
On each lover's arm a girl I wish I knew
On an evening in Roma Though there's grinning and mandolining in sunny Italy
The beginning has just begun when the sun goes down So please meet me in the plaza near your casa
I am only one, and one is much too few
On an evening in Roma Don't know what the country's coming to
But in Rome do as the Romans do
Will you, on an evening in Roma (Though there's grinning and mandolining in sunny Italy)
(The beginning has just begun when the sun goes down) Come è bello se la luna brilla
Stretti stretti co 'na pupa bella passeggiar
Sotto'er celo de Roma Don't know what the country's coming to
But in Rome do as the Romans do
Will you, on an evening in Roma Sott'er celo de Roma
On an evening in Roma (The sweet, sweet memories you've given me
You can't beat the memories you've given me)
Take one fresh and tender kiss,
Add one stolen night of bliss,
One girl; one boy; some grief; some joy: Memories are made of this. Don't forget a small moonbeam.
Fold it lightly with a dream.
Your lips and mine,
Two sips of wine: Memories are made of this. Then add the wedding bells;
One house where lovers dwell;
Three little kids for the flavor.
Stir carefully through the days ~
See how the flavor stays.
These are the dreams you will savor. With His blessings from above,
Serve it generously with love.
One man, one wife,
One love, through life: Memories are made of this. (X2) How lucky can one guy be?
I kissed her and she kissed me.
Like a fella once said:
"Ain't that a kick in the head?" The room was completely black
I hugged her and she hugged back.
Like the sailor said quote:
"Ain't that a hole in a boat?" My head keeps spinnin'
I go to sleep and keep grinnin'
If this is just the beginnin'
My life is gonna be beautiful. I've sunshine enough to spread
It's just like the fella said.
Tell me quick
ain't love a kick in the head? Like the fella once said:
"Ain't that a kick in the head?" Like the sailor said quote:
"Ain't that a hole in a boat?" My head keeps spinnin'
I go to sleep and keep grinnin'
If this is just the beginnin'
My life is gonna be beautiful. She's telling me we'll be wed
She's picked out a king size bed
I couldn't feel any better or I'd be sick.
Tell me quick
Oh, ain't that a kick...?
Tell me quick
ain't love a kick in the head? Arriverderci, Roma
Goodbye, goodbye to Rome City of a million moonlit faces
City of a million warm embraces
Where I found the one of all the faces
Far from home Arriverderci, Roma
It's time for us to part Save the wedding bells for my returnin'
Keep my lover's arms outstretched and yearnin'
Please be sure the flame of love keeps burnin'
In her heart Arriverderci, Roma
It's time for us to part Save the wedding bells for my returnin'
Keep my lover's arms outstretched and yearnin'
Please be sure the flame of love keeps burnin'
In her heart Goodnight sweetheart
Til we meet tomorrow
Goodnight sweetheart
Sleep will vanish sorrow
Tears and parting may make us forlorn
But with the dawn a new day is born
Goodnight sweetheart
Though I'm not beside you
Goodnight sweetheart
Still my love will guide you
Dreams will enfold you
In each one I'll hold you
Goodnight sweetheart
Dreams will enfold you
In each one I'll hold you

Là lariulà pesce fritt'e baccalà
Uei cumpà
'Na scuppetta c'eggi'accattà (Si bon si bon)
C'est si bon (Si bon si bon)
Lovers say that in France (Si bon si bon)
When they thrill to romance (Si bon si bon)
It means that it's so good Ah c'est si bon (Si bon si bon)
So I say it to you (Si bon si bon)
Like the French people do (Si bon si bon)
Because it's oh so good Every word every sigh every kiss dear
Leads to only one thought and it's this dear
Oh it's on so good (Si bon si bon)
Nothing else can replace (Si bon si bon)
Just your slightest embrace (Si bon si bon)
And if you only would
Would be my own for the rest of my days
I would whisper this phrase
C'est si bon (Si bon si bon)
The river Seine (Si bon si bon)
The Left Bank (Si bon si bon)
The Eiffel Tower (Si bon si bon)
The meatballs, pizzas, school cheating, now that's stuffs pretty good too
(En voyant notre mine ravie)
I have only one thought and it's this dear
Oh it's so good (Si bon si bon)
Nothing else can replace (Si bon si bon)
Just your slightest embrace (Si bon si bon)
And if you only would
Be my own for the rest of my days
I would whisper this phrase
My darling c'est si bon (Si bon si bon)
Gigi si bon (Si bon si bon)
Mimi si bon (Si bon si bon)
And all those mademoiselles that are si bon
In fact you'd be surprised how much good stuff there is around here Frank (Si bon si bon) Heart and soul
I fell in love with you heart and soul
Because you held me tight
And stole a kiss in the night Heart and soul
I begged to be adored
I lost control and tumbled overboard gladly
That magic night we kissed
There in the moon mist
Oh but your lips were thrilling, much to thrilling
Never before were mine so faintly willing
But now I see what one embrace can do
That little kiss you stole
Held all my heart and stole Now I see what one embrace can do
Look at me it's got me loving you madly
That little kiss you stole
Held all my heart and soul Sunlight dances on the sea
Tender thoughts occur to me
I have often seen your eyes
In the nighttime when I dream When I pass a garden fair
And the scent is in the air
In my mind a dream awakes
And my heart begins to break But you said goodbye to me
Now all I can do is grieve
Can it be that you forgot?
Darling forget me not! Please don't say farewell So I can mend houston. well it's lonesome in this old town
everybody puts me down
i'm a face without a name
just walking in the rain
going back to houston, houston, houston
i've got holes in both of my shoes
well i'm a walking case of the blues
saw a dollar yesterday
but the wind blew it away
going back to houston, houston, houston
i haven't eaten in about a week
i'm so hungry when i walk i squeak
nobody calls me friend
it's sad the shape i'm in
going back to houston, houston, houston
i got a girl waiting out for me
well at least she said she'd be
i got a home and a big warm bed
and a feather pillow for my head
going back to houston, houston, houston Trailer for sale or rent rooms to left fifty cents
No phone no pool no pets ain't got no cigarettes
But two hours of pushing broom buys a eight by twelve four bit room
I'm a man of means by no means king of the road Third boxcar midnight train destination Bangor Maine
Old worn out suit and shoes don't pay no union dues
I smoke old stogies I have found short but not too big around
I'm a man of means by no means king of the road Every engineer on every train
And all of the children and all of their names
(And every hand-out in every town)
Every lock that ain't locked when no one's around I sing trailer for sale or rent...
King of the road king of the road It's knowing that your door is always open and your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowing I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried up on some line
That keeps you in the back roads by the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy planted on their columns now that binds me
Or something that somebody said because they thought we fit together walking
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track by the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind Well I dip my cup of soup back from the gurgling crackling caldron in some train yard
My beard a roughening coal pile and a dirty hat pulled low across my face Cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend I hold you to my breast and find that you're waving from the back roads by the river of my memory
Ever smiling ever gentle on my mind (Roy Turk - Jack Smith - Maceo Pinkard) Gimme a little kiss, will ya huh
What are you gonna miss, will ya huh
Gosh oh gee, why do you refuse
I can't see what you've gotta lose. Oh gimme a little squeeze, will ya huh
Why do you wanna make me blue
I wouldn't say a word if I were asking for the world
But what's a little kiss between a fellow and his girl? Oh gimme a little kiss will ya huh
And I'll give it right back to you. --- Instrumental --- Will ya huh? --- Instrumental --- Will ya huh? Once again a plea I'm gonne make
Oh tell me when do I get a break
Oh say when you're givin' in, will ya huh
Anything that you ask I'll do. I'll take you for a little ride
Where we can be alone
And once you kiss me
You will never think of walkin' home. Oh gimme a little kiss, will ya huh
Or I'll steal about ten. Yes, steal about ten for you... In Napoli beside the sea
It happened on a night like this
In Napoli our hearts were free
And we surrendered to a kiss There 'neath the stars I saw heaven in her eyes
There 'neath the stars I knew this was paradise
All through the night in sweet delight
We shared the tenderness of love But with the dawn my love was gone
Just like the fading stars above
My lonely heart cries out, "Please come back to me"
Beside the sea in dear old Napoli There 'neath the stars I saw heaven in her eyes
There 'neath the stars I knew this was paradise
All through the night in sweet delight
We shared the tenderness of love But with the dawn my love was gone
Just like the fading stars above
My lonely heart cries out, "Please come back to me"
Beside the sea in dear old Napoli Every night I sit here by my window
(Window)
Starin' at a lonely avenue
(Avenue)
Watching lovers holding hands and laughin'
(Laughin')
Thinkin' 'bout the things they used to do (Thinkin' 'bout things)
Like a walk in the park
(Things)
Like a kiss in the dark (Things)
Like a sailor boat ride
(Yeah, yeah)
What about the night we cried? Things like a lovers vow
Things that we don't do now
Thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do
(Used to do) Memories are all I have to cling to
(Cling to)
And heartaches are the friends I'm talking
(Talking to)
When I'm not thinking of just how much I loved you
(Loved you)
But I'm thinking 'bout the things we used to do (Thinkin' 'bout things)
Like a walk in the park
(Things)
Like a kiss in the dark (Things)
Like a sailor boat ride
(Yeah, yeah)
What about the night we cried? Things like a lovers vow
Things that we don't do now
Thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do I still can hear the juke-box softly playin'
(Playin')
And the face I see is there belongs to you
(Belongs to you)
No, there's not a single sound and there's nobody else around
Well, I just mean thinkin' 'bout things we used to do (Thinkin' 'bout things)
Like a walk in the park
(Things)
Like a kiss in the dark (Things)
Like a sailor boat ride
(Yeah, yeah)
What about the night we cried? Things like a lovers vow
Things that we don't do now
Thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do And the heartaches are the friends I'm talking to
(Talking to)
You got me thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do
(Used to do)
Thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do
(Never do) With his little mandolino
And a twinkle in his eye
Senorinas he can win
Always for another guy Italians love to sip a cup of cappuccino
And listen to the man who plays the mandolino
You offer him a cigarette a glass of vino
That's how he's paid to serenade your lady fair With his little mandolino
And a twinkle in his eye
Senorinas he can win
Always for another guy He seems like such a happy man
The man who plays the mandolino
He sings a song of sweet romance for all the lovers as they dance
But all he's holding in his arms is just a little mandolino
He has no woman of his own so every night he walks alone With his little mandolino
And a twinkle in his eye
Senorinas he can win
Always for another guy (And while he's strumming songs of love the man who plays the mandolino)
(His eyes are always looking for a senorina to adore)
He drinks a toast to his true love each time he lifts a glass of vino
And so until that lucky day he looks for her along the way With his little mandolino
And a twinkle in his eye
Senorinas he can win
Always for another guy
(Both) The man who plays the mandolino Ev'ry day I
sit and pray I
win you over soon. Say yes, won't you? Do you, don't you want this world in tune? What does it take to persuade you?
And how much more must I serenade you? Listen to me, Sophia,
Have you any idea
How much you mean to me-a?
How much you'll never know! If I'm all agitato,
Ev'ry heart string vibrato,
Ev'ry look passionato,
Who but you made me so? It's love, it's love crescendo,
Never ever diminuenndo. Say the word, sweet Sophia,
Or from earth I resign.
Oh, Sophia, be mine! Listen to me, Sophia,
Have you any idea
How much you mean to me-a?
Ev'ry day more and more! All the others were so-so,
Not a one amoroso,
But with you I'm aglow, so,
Only you I adore. You're sweeter than spumone,
Sweeter even than zabaglione. Say the word, sweet Sophia,
Let our heart's (sic) intertwine.
Oh, Sophia, be mine!
Oh, Sophia, be mine!
Les autres paroles Gigi
Am I a fool without a mind
Or have I merely been too blind to realize
Oh Gigi
Why you've been growing up before my very eyes
Gigi
You're not at all that funny awkward little girl I knew
Oh no
Overnight there's been a breathless change in you
Oh Gigi
While you were trembling on the brink
Oh Gigi
Have I been standing up too close or back too far
When did your sparkle turn to fire
And your warmth become desire
Oh what miracle has made you the way you are Gigi
While you were trembling on the brink
Was I out yonder somewhere blinking at a star
Oh Gigi
Have I been standing up too close or back too far
When did your sparkle turn to fire
And your warmth become desire
Oh what miracle has made you the way you are You've got to give a little, take a little.
And let your poor heart to break a little.
That's the story of.
That's the glory of love. You've got to laugh a little, cry a little.
Until the clouds roll by a little.
That's the story of.
That's the glory of love. As long, as there's the two of us.
We, ve got the world and all it's charms.
And when the world is through with us.
We've got each others arms You've got to win a little, lose a little.
And always have to blues a little.
That's the story of.

That's the glory of love. (Instrumental, fading out). The sun is sinking in the west
The cattle go down to the stream
The redwing settles in the nest
It's time for a cowboy to dream Purple light in the canyons
That's where I long to be
With my three good companions
Just my rifle, pony and me Gonna hang (gonna hang) my sombrero (my sombrero)
On the limb (on the limb) of a tree (of a tree)

Sings a sweet melody
Riding to Amarillo)
Just my rifle, pony and me
No more cows (no more cows) to be ropened (to be ropened)
No more strays will I see
Round the bend (round the bend) she'll be waitin' (she'll be waitin')
For my rifle, pony and me
For my rifle, my pony and me Welcome to my world

Because I'm in love
It always is spring in my heart
With you in my arms The snow is just white blossoms
That fall from above
And here is the reason my dear
Your magical charms The night is cold
The trees are bare
But I can feel the scent of roses in the air
It's June in January
But only because I'm in love with you (The night is cold
The trees are bare)
But I can feel the scent of roses in the air
It's June in January
But only because I'm in love with you See the tree how big it's grown
But friend that hasn't been too long it wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted it was just a twig. And the first snow came and she ran out
To brush the snow away it wouldn't die
Came running in all excited slipped
And almost hurt herself I laughed till I cried. She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart, I loved her so
I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago. It would sure embarrass her
When I came in from working late 'cause I would know
That she'd been sittin' there
And crying over some sad and silly late, late show. And honey, I miss you I'm being good
I'd love to be with you if only I could. She wrecked the car and she was sad
And so afraid that I'd be mad but what the heck 
Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say she saw through me and hugged my neck. I came home unexpectedly
Caught her crying needlessly in the middle of the day
It was in the early spring
When flowers bloom and robins sing, she went away. And honey, I miss you and I'm being good
I'd love to be with you if only I could. Yes, one day while I wasn't at home
When she was there and all alone the angels came
Now all I have is memories of honey
And I wake up nights and call her name. Now my life's an empty stage
Where honey lived and honey played and love grew up
A small cloud passes overhead
And cries down on the flower bed that honey loved. See the tree how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long, it wasn't big
Laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted it was just a twig... When the sun goes down the tide goes out
The people gather round and they all begin to shout
Hey hey Uncle Dud it's a treat to beat your feet on the Mississippi mud
It's a treat to beat your feet on the Mississippi mud What a dance do they do
Lordy how I'm telling you
They don't need no band
They keep time by clapping their hands
Just as happy as a cow chewing on a cud
When the people beat their feet on the Mississippi mud Lordy how they play it
Goodness how they sway it
Uncle Joe, Uncle Jim
How they pound the mire with vigor and vim
Joy the music thrills me
Boy it nearly kills me
What a show when they go
Say they beat up either fast or slow When the sun goes down the tide goes out
The people gather round and they all begin to shout
Say hey Uncle Dud it's a treat to beat your feet on the Mississippi mud
It's a treat to beat your feet on the Mississippi mud What a dance do they do
Lordy how I'm telling you
They don't need no band
They keep time by clapping their hands
Just as happy as a cow chewing on a cud
When the people beat their feet on the Mississippi mud When the sun goes down the tide goes out
The people gather round and they all begin to shout
Hey hey Uncle Dud it's a treat to beat your feet on the Mississippi mud
It's a treat to beat your feet on the Mississippi mud What a dance do they do
Lordy how I'm telling you
They don't need no band
They keep time by clapping their hands
Just as happy as a cow chewing on a cud
When the people beat their feet
When the people beat their feet
When the people beat their feet
On the Mississippi mud I'll be down to get you in a taxi honey
You'd better be ready around half past eight
Ah baby don't be late I want to be there when the band starts honey Well just remember when we get there honey
Two steps gonna handle them all
Dance with both my shoes when they play the jelly roll blues
Tomorrow night at the darktown strutter's ball Well I'll be down to get you in a taxi honey
You'd better be ready around half past eight
Ah baby don't be late I want to be there when the band starts honey Just remember when we get there honey
Two steps and gonna handle them all
Dance off both my shoes when they play the jelly roll blues
Tomorrow night at the darktown strutter's ball I'll be down to get you in a taxi honey
You'd better be ready around half past eight
Ah baby don't be late I want to be there when the band starts honey Just remember when we get there honey
Two steps gonna handle them all
I'm gonna dance off both my shoes when they play the jelly roll blues
Tomorrow night at the darktown strutter's ball I don't know why I love ya like I do
I don't know why I just do

Mio cuore When you're smiling
When you're smiling
The whole world smiles with you When you're laughing
Oh when you're laughing
The sun comes shining through But when you're crying
You bring on the rain
So stop your sighing, be happy again Keep on smiling
'Cause when you're smiling
The whole world smiles with you But when you're crying
You bring on the rain
So stop your sighing, be happy again Keep on smiling
'Cause when you're smiling
The whole world smiles with you Nothing could be finer than to be in Carolina in the morning
No one could be sweeter than my sweetie when I meet her in the morning
Where the morning glories twine around the door
Whispering pretty stories I long to hear once more
Strolling with my girlie where the dew is pearly early in the morning
Butterflies all flutter up and kiss each buttercup at dawning
If I had Aladdin's lamp for only a day
I'd make a wish and here's what I'd say
Nothing could be finer than to be in Carolina in the morning Where the morning glories twine around the door
Whispering pretty stories I long to hear once more
Strolling with my girlie where the dew is pearly early in the morning
Butterflies all flutter up and kiss each buttercup at dawning
If I had Aladdin's lamp for only a day
I'd make a wish and here's what I'd say
Nothing could be finer than to be in Carolina in the AM
Carolina in the morning If our lips should meet in Innamorata
Kiss me kiss me sweet in Innamorata
Hold me close and say you're mine
I heaven's door in Innamorata
Want you more and more in Innamorata
You're a symphony the very beautiful sonanta my in Innamorata
Say that you're my sweetheart, my love You're a symphony the very beautiful sonanta my in Innamorata
Say that you're my sweetheart, my one and only sweetheart
Say you're my sweetheart, my love Volare, oh oh
Cantare, oh oh oh oh
Let's fly way up to the clouds
Away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like bird of a feather, a rainbow together we'll find
Volare, oh oh
E contare, oh oh oh oh
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
Penso che un sogno cosi non ritorni mai piu
Mi dipingevo le mani e la faccia di blu
Poi d'improvviso venivo dal vento rapito
E incominciavo a volare nel cielo infinito
Volare, oh oh
E contare, oh oh oh oh
Nel blu, dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lassu
E volavo, volavo felice piu in alto del sole ed ancora piu su
Mentre il mondo pian piano spariva lontano laggiu
Una musica dolce suonava soltanto per me
Volare, oh oh
E cantare, oh oh oh oh
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
Nel blu, dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lassu I'm Sitting On Top Of The World I'm sitting on top of the world,
Just rolling along, just rolling along.
I'm quitting the blues of the world,
Just singing a song, just singing a song. Glory, hallelujah, I just phoned the parson,
"Hey, Par, get ready to call!"
Just like humpty dumpty,
I'm ready to fall. I'm sitting on top of the world,
Just rolling along, just rolling along.
I'm quitting the blues of the world,
Just singing a song, just singing a song The faucet it is dripping and the fence is falling down
My pocket needs some money so I can't go in to town
My brother he ain't working and my sister doesn't care
The car it needs a motor so I can't go anywhere Manana Manana
Manana is soon enough for me Once I had some money but I gave it to a friend
He said he'd pay me double he was only for a lend
But he said a little later that the horse it was so slow
Why he gave the horse my money is something I don't know Manana Manana
Manana is good enough for me My brother took his suitcase and he went away to school
My father said he only learned to be a silly fool
My father said that I should learn to make a chili pot
But then I burned the house down the chili was too hot Manana Manana
Manana is soon enough for me The window it is busted and the rain is coming in
If someone doesn't fix it I'll be soaking to my skin
But if we wait a day or two the rain may go away
And we don't need a window on such a lovely day
Manana manana manana is soon enough for me
Manana manana manana is soon enough for me Five foot two, eyes of blue
But oh what those five foot could do
Has anyone seen my gal Turned up nose and turned down hose
Never had another beau
Has anyone seen my gal Now if you run into five foot two covered with fur
Diamond ring and all those things
Bet your life it isn't hers
Could she love could she woo
Could she love could she coo
Has anyone seen my gal Five foot two, eyes of blue but oh what those five foot could do
Has anyone seen my gal
Now if you run into five foot two covered with fur
Diamond ring and all those things
Bet your life that it wasn't her Could she loving could she coo
Could she could she woo
Has anyone seen my gal Watch the sunrise on a tropic isle
See the pyramids along the Nile
Just remember darlin', all the while
You belong to me See the market place in old Algiers
Send me photographs and souvenirs
Just remember when a dream appears
You belong to me I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too and blue Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember til you're home again
You belong to me Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember til you're home again
You belong to me Amor amor amor
This word so sweet that I repeat
Means I have adored you
Amor amor my love
Will you deny this heart that I have placed before you I can't find another word with meaning so clear
My lips try to whisper sweeter things in your ear
Somehow or other nothing sounds quite so dear
As this soft caressing word I know Amor amor my love
When you're away there is no day and nights are lonely
Amor amor my love
Make my life divine say you'll be mine and love me only I can't find another word with meaning so clear
My lips try to whisper sweeter things in your ear
Somehow or other nothing sounds quite so dear
As this soft caressing word I know Amor amor my love
When you're away there is no day and nights are lonely
Amor amor my love
Make my life divine say you'll be mine and love me only
Make my life divine say you'll be mine and love me only
Make my life divine say you'll be mine and love me only You are always in my heart
Even though you're far away
I can hear the music of the song I sang to you
You are always in my heart
And when skies above are gray
I remember that you care and then and there the sun breaks through
Just before I go to sleep
There's a rendezvous I keep
And the dreams I always meet help me forget we're far apart
I don't know exactly when dear
But I'm sure we'll meet again dear
And my darling 'til we do
You are always in my heart And the dreams I always meet help me forget were far apart
I don't know exactly when dear
But I'm sure we'll meet again dear
And my darling 'til we do
You are always in my heart I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
I'm gonna write words oh, so sweet
They're gonna knock me off my feet
A lot of kisses on the bottom
I'll be glad I got 'em. I'm gonna smile and say I hope you're feeling better
And sign with love the way you do
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you. I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
I'm gonna write words oh so sweet
They're gonna knock me off my feet
A lot of kisses on the bottom
I'll be glad I got 'em. I'm gonna smile and say I hope you're feeling better
And sign with love the way you do
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you... Just in time, I found you just in time
Before you came my time was running low
I was lost, the losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed, no where to go Now you're here, now I know just where I'm going
No more doubt or fears I've found my way
For love came just in time, you found me just in time
And changed my lonely life that lucky day Now you're here, now I know just where I'm going
No more doubt or fears I've found my way
For love came just in time, you found me just in time
And changed my lonely life that lucky day (I don't know what I'm doing more than half of the time) When the party is over and the laughter is through
And the last song stops playing I'll be thinking of you
For there's such a sweet mem'ry when you're crossing my mind
I don't know what I'm doing more than half of the time I don't know what I'm doing with this drink in my hand
Guess I just gone to pieces like a ship on the sand
Your sweet name I keep calling while you jumble my mind
I don't know what I'm doing more than half of the time
(I don't know what I'm doing more than half of the time) I may never find sunshine if I'd never find you
So I'll search all the places where the lights burning blue
Oh you just might be lonesome when I'm fooling my mind
I don't know what I'm doing more than half of the time
I don't know what I'm doing more than half of the time (background chorus) (Peanut do bop do bop)
(Peanut do bop do bop)
In Cuba each merry maid wakes up with this seranade
Peanuts (they're nice and hot)
Peanuts (he sells a lot)
Peanuts
If you haven't got bananas don't be blue
Peanuts in a little bag are calling you
Don't waste them (no tummy ache)
You'll taste them (when you're awake)
For at the very break of day
The peanut vendor's on his way
At dawning the whistle blows
(through every city, town and country lane
you hear him sing his plantive little strain)
And as he goes by to you he'll say
(Big jumbos) big jumbo ones
(Come buy those) peanuts roasted today
(Come buy those freshly roasted today) If you're looking for a moral to this song
50 million monkeys can't be wrong
(Peanuts do bop do bop)
(Peanuts do bop do bop)
(Peanuts do bop do bop) (In Cuba his smiling face is welcome most anyplace)
(Peanuts they hear him cry)
(Peanuts they all reply)
(If you're looking for an early morning treat)
(Get some double jointed peanuts good to eat)
For breakfast (or dinnertime)
For supper (most anytime)
The merry twinkle in his eye
He's got a way that makes you buy
(Each morning) that whistle blows
(Are you more than I sell) If an apple keeps the doctor from your door
Peanuts ought to keep him from you even more
(Peanuts) we'll meet again
This street again
We'll eat again
You Peanut Man, that peanut man's gone

Oh carry my loved one home safely to me She sailed with the dawning all day I've been blue
Red sails in the sunset I'm trusting in you Swift wings you must borrow make straight for the shore
We'll marry tomorrow and she'll go sailing no more Red sails in the sunset way out on the sea
Oh carry my loved one home safely to me (Swift wings you must borrow make straight for the shore)
We'll marry tomorrow and she'll go sailing no more Red sails in the sunset way out on the sea
Oh carry my loved one home safely to me We' Marie, we' Marie

got my roll on my shoulder
I'm as free as a breeze
an' do as I please,
just a bummin' around . . . Gotta million friends,
I don't feel any older
I've got nothin' to lose
not even the blues,
just a bummin' around . . . Whenever worries start
to botherin' me (start botherin' me!)
I grab my coat, my ol' slouch hat,
hit the trail again,
you see . . . I ain't got a dime, 
don't care where I'm goin'
I'm as free as a breeze
an' do as I please,
just a bummin' around! [ instrumental break ] I hit the trail again,
you see . . . I ain't got a dime,
don't care where I'm goin'
I'm as free as a breeze
an' do as I please,
just a bummin' around . . . just a bummin' around . . .
just a bummin' around . . .
just a bummin' around . . . Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money
Maybe we're ragged and funny
But we'll travel along singing a song
Side by side. Don't know what's coming tomorrow
Maybe it's trouble and sorrow
But we'll travel the road sharin' our load
Side by side. Through all kind of weather
What if the sky should fall
As long as we're together
It doesn't matter at all. When they've all had their quarrels and parted
We'll be the same as we started
Just to travel along singing a song
Side by side. 
When they've all had their quarrels and parted
We'll be the same as we started
Just to travel along singing a song
Side by side. (Side by side...) The whole wide world is wild about Marina

I'm yours alone Perhaps I hold your heart too tightly
But who am I to say
If I should hold it lightly
It might slip away I love you much too much
You've never really known
I love you oh so much
I'm yours alone The bells are ringing for me and my gal
Oh the birds are singing for me and my gal
Well everyone's been knowlin' to a wedding there goin'
And for weeks they've been sewing every Susie and Sal They're congregatin' for me and my gal
While the parson's waitin' for me and my gal
And sometime I'm gonna build a little home for two three or four or more
In love land for me and my gal And sometime I'm gonna build a little home for two three or four or more
In love land for me and my gal Up in the mornin', out on the job
I work like the devil for my pay
I know that lucky old sun
Has nothin' to do
But to roll around heaven all day
I fuss with my woman and I toy with my kids
I sweat til I'm wrinkled and gray
I know that lucky old sun
Has nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day.
Yea, Lord above don't you see I'm pinin'
I got tears all in my eyes
Why don't you send down that cloud
With the silver linin'
Lift me up to paradise.
Show me that river
Why don't you take me across
And wash all my troubles away
I know that lucky old sun
He's got nothin' to do
But just roll around heaven all day.
Send down that cloud
With the silver linin'
Lift me up to paradise
Show me that river
And take me across
Wash all my troubles away
And I know the lucky old sun
He's got nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day.
Yes sir, he got nothin'
But roll around heaven all day.
I say he just roll around heaven all day.
Now you say it...
(with chorus)
Roll around heaven all day.
(Solo speaking) Yes Lord... (with Line Renaud) [Both]Here we are out of cigarettes
[LR] Holding hands and yawning
[DM] Look how late it gets
[Both]Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
[Both]And too much in love to say goodnight [LR] Here we are in the cozy chair
[LR] Picking on a wishbone from the frigidaire
[Both]Two sleepy people with nothing to say
[Both]And too much in love to break away [DM] Do you remember the nights we used to linger in the hall
[LR] Father didn't like you at all
[LR] Do you remember the reason why we marries in the fall
[DM] To rent this little nest and get a bit of rest [Both]Well here we are just above the Seine
[LR] Foggy little fella, [DM] drowsy little dame
[Both]Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
[Both]And too much in love to say goodnight (Do you remember the nights we used to linger in the hall)
[LR] Father didn't like you at all

[LR] Bon soir [DM] Bon nuit (You'll aways be the one I love
You'll always be the one I love)
Every hour every day every year
You'll always be the one I love
Through each smile through each sigh through each tear
My heart will feel the same old glow
Even though the stars may fade from above
Well I promise there will be no other arms for me
You'll always be the one I love (You'll aways be the one I love
You'll always be the one I love) My heart will feel the same old glow
Even though the stars may fade from above
I promise there will be no other arms for me
You'll always be the one I love
You'll always be the one I love Hands that are strong, but wrinkled
Doin' work that never gets done
Hair that's lost some of the beauty
By too many hours in the sun Eyes that show some disappointment
And there's been quite a lot in her life
She's the foundation I lean on
My woman, my woman, my wife Everyday has been uphill
Oh, we've climbed, but we can't reach the top
I'm weak and I'm easily discouraged
She just smiles when I want to stop Lips that are weary but tender
With love that strengthens my life
A Saint in a dress made of gingham
My woman, my woman, my wife Two little babies were born in the Spring
But died when the Winter was new
I lost control of my mind and my soul
But my woman's faith carried us through When she reaches that river
Lord, you know what she's worth
Give her that mansion up yonder
'Cause she's been through hell here on Earth Lord, give her my share of Heaven
If I've earned any here in this life
'Cause, God, I believe she deserves it
My woman, my woman, my wife Peg o' my heart
I'll love you don't let us part
I love you I always knew it would be you
Since I heard your lilting laughter
It's your Irish heart I'm after. Peg o' my heart
Your glances make my heart say
How's chances come be my own
Come make your home in my heart...

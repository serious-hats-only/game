Rosemary
Heaven restores you in life
You're coming with me
Through the aging, the fear and the strife
It's the smiling on the package
It's the faces in the sand
It's the thought that moves you upwards
Embracing me with two hands
Right will take you places
Yeah maybe to the beach
When your friends they do come crying
Tell them now your pleasure's set upon slow-release Hey wait
Great smile
sensitive to fate,
Not denial
But hey who's on trial? It took a lifespan with no cellmate
The long way back
Saying, "Hey, why can't we look the other way?" we speaks about travel
Yeah, we think about the land
We smart like all people
Feeling real tan
I could take you places
Do you need a new man?
Wipe the pollen from the faces
Make revision to a dream while you wait in the van Hey wait
Great smile
sensitive to fate,
Not denial
But hey who's on trial? It took a lifespan with no cellmate
To find a long way back
Saying, "Hey, why can't we look the other way?"
You're weightless, you are exotic
You need something for which to care
Saying, "Hey, why can't we look the other way?" Leave some shards under the belly
Lay some grease inside my hand
It's a sentimental jury
And the makings of a good plan
You've come to love me lightly
Yeah you've come to hold me tight
Is this motion everlasting
Or do shutters pass in the night? Rosemary
Oh heaven restores you in life
I spent a lifespan with no cellmate
The long way back
Saying, "Hey, why can't we look the other way?"
You're weightless, semi-erotic
You need someone to take you there
Saying, "Hey, why can't we look the other way?"
Why can't we just play the other game?
Why can't we just look the other way?  Yeah but nobody searches
Nobody cares somehow
When the loving that you've wasted
Comes raining from a hapless cloud
And I might stop and look upon your face
Disappear in the sweet sweet gaze
See the living that surrounds me
Dissipate in a violet place Can't you see what you've done to my heart and soul?
This is a wasteland now
We spies
We slow hands
You put the weights all around yourself
We spies oh yeah we slow hands You put the weights all around yourself now
I submit my incentive is romance
I watched the pole dance of the stars
We rejoice because the hurting is so painless
From the distance of passing cars
But I am married to your charms and grace
I just feel crazy like the good old days
You make me want to pick up a guitar And celebrate the myriad ways that I love you
Can't you see what you've done to my heart and soul?
This is a wasteland now
We spies yeah we slow hands
You put the weights all around yourself
We spies oh yeah we slow hands Killer for hire you know not yourself
We spies
We slow hands
You put the weights all around yourself
We spies oh yeah we slow hands
We retire like nobody else
We spies intimate slow hands
Killer for hire you know not yourself
We spies intimate slow hands
You let the face slap around herself I did not take to analysis
So I had to make up my mind
And hold it for a while I would not just leave you without a kiss
But I guess there must come a time
When there's no more tears to cry Thieves and snakes need homes
Need homes, barricade It starts to feel like a barricade
To keep us away, to keep us away
It kind of does
It starts to feel like a barricade
To keep us away, keep us away I could not lean on the politics
'Cause I didn't want to train my eye
To hold so short a time Oh so high, just don't know
Where the blind could lead the sightless
But I still like to witness Thieves and snakes need homes
Need homes, barricade It starts to feel like a barricade
To keep us away, to keep us away
It kind of does
It starts to feel like a barricade
To keep us away, keep us away Full speed, half blind
Full tilt, decline
We turn to past times
Full speed, half blind You know us
You know us
And we said
I'm sorry
Say, I'm sorry Sometimes it feels like a barricade
To keep us away, keep us away
It kind of does
How much fear can you fabricate
To keep us away, keep us away
You know us
Full speed, half blind
Full tilt, decline
We turn to past times
Full speed, half blind
Full speed, half blind
Full tilt, decline
On to old times
Full speed, half blind Yours is the only version of my desertion
That I could ever subscribe to
That is all that I can do
You are a past dinner, the last winner I'm raping all around me
Until the last drop is behind you
You're so cute when you're frustrated, dear
Yeah, you're so cute when you're sedated, dear Oh yes, dear
Sleep tight, grim rite
We have two hundred couches where you can
Sleep tight, grim rite
We have two hundred couches where you can Sleep tight, grim rite
We have two hundred couches where you can
Sleep tonight
Sleep tonight
Sleep tonight
Sleep tonight
You are the only person who's completely certain
There's nothing here to be into That is all that you can do
You are a past sinner, the last winner
And everything we've come to
That makes you, you But you cannot safely say
That while I will be away
That you will not consider sadly
How you helped me to stray And you will not reach me I am
Resenting a position that's past resentment
And now I can't consider
And now there is this distance, so Sleep tight, grim rite
We have two hundred couches where you can
Sleep tight, grim rite
We have two hundred couches where you can Sleep tight, grim rite
We have two hundred couches where you can
Sleep tonight
Sleep tonight

When there's nothing to do I wish I could live free
I hope it's not beyond me
Settling down, it takes time
One day we'll live together
And life will be better
I have it here, yeah, in my mind
Baby, you know someday you'll slow
And baby, my heart's been breaking 'Cause I gave a lot to you
I take a lot from you, too
You slave a lot for me
Guess you could say I gave you my edge But I can't pretend
I need to defend
Some part of me from you
I know I've spent some time lying
I can't pretend
I don't need to defend
Some part of me from you
I know I've spent some time lying How am I doing? You're looking all right tonight
I think we should go I haven't slept for two days
I've bathed in nothing but sweat
And I've made hallways
Scenes for things to regret
My friends, they come
And the lines, they go by
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry I live my life in cocaine
Just some rage and three kinds of yes
And I've made stairways
Such scenes for things that I regret
Oh, those days in the sun
They bring a tear to my eye
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry But you're so young
You're so young
You look in my eyes
You're so young
So sweet so suprised Saw a sign, it says "okay"
Gotta take a ride just recline
In the faraway
Got to take some time to realize
That my friends, they come
And the lines, they go by
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry But you're so young
You're so young
You look in my eyes
You look so young
So sweet, so suprised
You look so young
Like a daisy in my lazy eye
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry When she wept that love come over my head about
Oh, the feelings
And she wept, hold me again, I made no sound
Oh, the beating
And she swore love is never done
So easily
And we went over again, my head about
Oh, the feeling She said you don't need time
Be tame, you won't need your maid inside
My faith won't lie
He said you don't need mine
Behave, you want to leave my lady lovers
Of my eighteen summers alone
She said, you don't read minds
Be patient, you won't leave me shakin'
Leave me shaking I keep falling, maybe half the time, maybe half the time
I keep falling, maybe half the time, maybe half the time
But it's all the rage back home
It's all the rage back home When she said, love come over my head about
Oh, what feeling
She said, you wanna reply?
Be paid, you're gonna see my face in lights
My faith won't lie
But my sweet, you don't need mine to come away
Just say you'll love me, just say you'll love me alone
She said you don't read minds
Be patient, you won't see me shakin'
You have been mistaken I keep falling, maybe half the time, maybe half the time
I keep falling, maybe half the time, maybe half the time
But it's all the rage back home
It's all the rage back home All the rage back home
All the rage back home
All the rage back...
I keep falling, maybe half the time, maybe half the time
It's all the rage back home
I keep falling, maybe half the time, maybe half the time
It's all the rage back home I wish I could eat the salt
Off of your lost faded lips
We can cap the old times
Make playing only logical harm
We can cap the old lines
Make playing that nothing else will change But she can read, she can read, she can read
She can read she's bad
She can read, she can read
She can read she's bad
Oh, she's bad But it's different now that I'm poor and aging
I'll never see this face again
You go stabbing yourself in the neck And we could find new ways of living
Make playing only logical harm
And we could top the old times
Clay-making that nothing else will change But she can read, she can read, she can read
She can read she's bad
She can read, she can read
She can read she's bad
Oh, she's bad It's different now that I'm poor and aging
I'll never see this place again
You go stabbing yourself in the neck
But it's different now that I'm poor and aging
I'll never see this place again
And you'll go stabbing yourself in the neck It's in the way that she poses
It's in the things that she puts in my hair
Her stories are boring and stuff
She's always calling my bluff
She puts it, she puts the weights into my little heart
And she gets in my room and she takes it apart
She puts the weights into my little heart
I said she puts the weights into my little heart
She packs it away
It's in the way that she walks
Her heaven is never enough
She puts the weights in my heart
She puts it, she puts the weights into my little heart Precipitate Good bad, Saturn makes your mind break in pieces
Good bad, so you cannot find the dimensions
and it will be around these spots that I've given to you
you will know that you breathe my vapours every time that you pass through this room
pass through this room
walk through my gloom Daphne you find me Daphne, when you find me let the blood drive and come alive with me Daphne,
symmetry you can't help but admire or rejoice from this sister
be bad, Saturn makes your mind break in pieces Good bad, so you cannot find the conventions
it will be around these spots that I've given to you
you will know that you breathe my vapours every time that you pass through this room
pass through this room
walk through my gloom Daphne you find me Daphne you find me to put you were inside you fight for my memory Daphne symmetry you can't help but admire or rejoice for this, seems to be
Daphne come as on display will you find a way to draw the curtains of damp around your blushing ambition blushing ambition... I found you inside my mind
I lost you inside my mind
I found you inside my mind
I lost you inside my mind I was a child I was a vice a coyote, conditions occasions facts
I was a child I was a vice a coyote, conditions occasions facts erase them all perhaps
erase them all
erase them all perhaps
my own thing, my own thing now you're all that I have here
now we can't remember
but you could fall back on lust when you've learnt to wait
they can be like the friends and neighbours you will get to appreciate them I have inside me some strange glow
still enjoying this that's why I made a mess
still enjoying this that's why I made a mess
that's why I made a mess Touch your thighs, I'm the lonely one
Remember that last swipe 'cause that was the right one
Oh, all your mysteries are moving in the sun
And show some love and respect
Wanna get some love and respect Baby you can see that the gazing eye won't lie
Don't give up your lover tonight
'Cause it's just you, me and this wire, alright
Let's tend to the engine tonight She found a lonely sound
She keeps on waitin' for time out there
Oh love, can you love me babe?
Love, is this loving babe?
Is time turning around? Feast your eyes, I'm the only one
Control me, console me
'Cause that's just how it should be done
Oh, your history's like fire from a busted gun
Now show some love and respect
Don't wanna get a life of regret But Baby, you can see that the gazing eye won't lie
Don't give up your lover tonight She found a lonely sound
She keeps on waitin' for time out there
Oh love, can you love me babe?
Love, is this loving babe?
Is time turning around? He slips into the bedroom
And you know he misses alright
Old names, we'll make some
Will sustain us through the night
Inside my bedroom, baby
Touch me, oh tonight
Promises, we'll make some
Will reveal our sense of right
You should be in my space
You should be in my life
You should be in my space
You should be in my life
You could be in my space Through the storms and the light
Baby you stood by my side
And life is wine
But there are days in this life When you see the teeth marks of time
Two lovers divide Sound meets sound babe
Her echoes, they surround And all that we need is one thing
Now what is there to allow
Babe it's time we gave
Something new a try Oh alone we may fight
So just let us be three And baby tonight
I see your lips are on fire And life is wine
Now the windows are open
The moon is so bright
No one can tell us What love brings for you and I
Sound meets sound babe
The echoes, they surround
And all that we need is one thing Now what is there to allow
Babe it's time we give
Something new a try
Oh alone we may fight
So just let us be three
Tonight
Through the storms and the light
Baby you stood by my side
And life is wine
You feel the sweet breath of time
It's whispering its truth, not mine
There's no I
In threesome
And I am all for it
Babe it's time we give
Something new a try
Oh alone we may fight
And feathers bend like trees
In the moonlight
Babe its time we give
Something new a try
Oh alone we may fight
So just let us be three
Tonight I'm timeless like a broken watch
I make money like Fred Astaire
I see that you've come to resist me, I'm a pitbull in time
Your pretense is not what restricts me
It's the circles inside
The anatomy of kisses and a teacher who tries
Who knows how we'll disappear?
Would you like to be my missus and in future with child?
You know we can't get back from here
But we can get away Baby don't you try to find me
Baby don't you try to fight
Baby don't you try to find me
Baby it will be alright Along the way tears drown in the wake of delight
There's nothing like this built today
You'll never see a finer ship in your life
We sail today, tears drown in the wake of delight
There's nothing like this built today
You'll never see a finer ship or receive a better tip in your life I am the scavenger between the sheets of union
Lately I can't tell for sure whether machines turn anyone
I am the scavenger between the sheets of union
Lately I can't tell for sure whether machines turn anyone Lady don't you try to find me
Lady there is no need to fight
Lady don't you try to find me
Lady it will be alright We sail today, tears will drown in your wake of delight
There's nothing like this built today
You'll never see a finer ship in your life
Along the way the sea will crowd us with lovers at night
There's nothing like this built today
You'll never see a finer ship or receive a better tip in your life I see that you've come to resist me, I'm a pit bull in time White Goddess, Red Goddess, Black Temptress of the sea you treat me right
Black Goddess, Red Goddess, White Temptress of the sea you treat me right
Oh my love, we're sailing to Norway
Oh my love, we're sailing tonight
Oh my love, we're sailing to Norway
Oh my love, we're leaving tonight It's way too late to be this locked inside ourselves
The trouble is that you're in love with someone else
It should be me
Oh, it should be me Sacred parts, your get aways
You come along on summer days
Tenderly, tastefully
And so may
We make time, try and find somebody else
This place is mine Set the day, you know exactly how I feel
I had my doubts, little girl
I'm in love with something real It could be me, that's changing
And so may
We make time to try and find somebody else
Who has a line
Now season with health
Two lovers walk a lakeside mile Try pleasing with stealth, rodeo
See what stands long ending fast
Oh, how I love you Oh, In the evenings when we are sleeping
We are sleeping
Oh, we are sleeping
And so may
we make time, we try and find somebody else
Who has a line
Now season with health
Two lovers walk a lakeside mile
Try pleasing with stealth, rodeo
See what stands long oh, ending fast You can't hold it too tight
These matters of security
You don't have to be wound so tight
Smoking on the balcony But it's like sleaze in the park
You women, you have no self-control
The angels remark outside
You are known for insatiable needs
I don't know a thing I've seen love
And I follow the speeding of starlight
I've seen love
And I follow the speeding of starswept night Yeah, pace is the trick
And to all the destruction in man Well I see you as you take your pride
My lioness
Your defenses seem wise
I can impress
And detentions are demised
My lioness
Can't you hurt it some?
Think I hurt it I've seen love
And I follow the speeding of starlight
I've seen love
And I follow the speeding of starswept night And now I select you
Slow down I let you
See how I stun
See how I stun And now I select you
Slow down I beg you
See how I stun
See how I stun And to all the destruction in man
And to all the corruption in my hand And now I select you
Slow down I let you
See how I stun
See how I stun And now I select you
Slow down I beg you
See how I stun
See how I stun And now I select you (I've seen love)
Slow down I let you
See how I stun
See how I stun And now I select you (I've seen love)
Slow down I beg you
I always follow the speeding of starswept night You don't hold a candle
You don't hold a candle
You don't hold a candle The fevered plastics that seal your body
They won't stop this rain, hey, hey
I was your eye in the night when the prophets fell
I said it looks like you summer well I want to stay magical
I want to stay yearning
(Nobody told you, nobody told you)
I want to feel up on your life
I miss you, but it looks like you summered well All the while all the protests that shined the same
But you will never notice
It's alright
I rely on the process, don't mind the frame
They will never take this dream from me It's alright
(I'll make it back)
It's alright
(It's all the way behind us)
It's alright I miss you, babe
I want you back
The signs we gave
Weren't those signs supposed to last? The rainy days
The Summer's back
The signs we gave
So what was that? You know we have ways
To make the seasons touch these ones
So let me take this, cover your eyes
Look away until it fades All the while all the protests that shined the same
But you will never notice
It's alright
I rely on the process, don't mind the frame
They will never take this dream from me It's alright
(Dream from me)
It's alright
(You sent me)
It's alright
(You sent me)
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
(You sent me) Be my desire
I'm a frustrated man
Summon us for peace
We do what we can
Feel my desire
Favor the bold
Some of us fall to the Earth
These others roam
Besieged by desire Come on baby, you played me out
You play me out
That looked like your chance to me
Come on, baby, you play me out
So I gave you up
It's time for a change of heart See my desire
No solemn moods
All of us are teammates
We stick to the rules
It's a real life desire Come on baby
You play me out
You lay me out
That looked like your chance to me
You play me out
So I gave you up
It's time for a change of heart I've been there
I've been here
Erased Be my desire
I'm a frustrated man
Some of us fall to the Earth
These others ran
They flee my desire Come on baby
You play me out
Oh, You played me out
So it's time for a change of heart
You played me out
So I have gave you up
You won't find no scars on me I've been there
I've been nere
Erased I've been there
I've been near
Erased She says it helps with the lights out
Her rabid glow is like Braille to the night
She swears I'm a slave to the details
But if your life is such a big fucking joke, why should I care? The clock is set for nine
But you know you're gonna make it eight
That you two can take some time
Teach each other to reciprocate She feels that my sentimental side should be held with kid's gloves
But she doesn't know that I left my urge in the icebox
She swears I'm just prey for the female
Well, then me up and throw me, babycakes, 'cause I like to get hooked The clock is set for nine
But you know you're gonna make it eight
All the people that you've loved
They're all bound to leave some keepsakes
I've been swinging all the time
Think it's time I learned your way
Picture you and me together in the jungle
It will be okay I'll bring you when my lifeboat sails through the night
That is, supposing that you don't sleep tonight It's like learning a new language
Helps me catch up on my mime
If you don't bring up those lonely parts
This could be a good time
It's like learning a new language
You come here to me
We'll collect those lonely parts and set them down
You come here to me She says brief things
Her love's a phony
My love's subliminal I'll lay down my glasses,
I'll lay down in houses,
If things come alive I'll subtract pain by ounces
Yeah, I will start painting houses
If things come alive I promise to commit no acts of violence
Be it physical or otherwise
If things come alive I'll say it now
I'll say it now
I'll say it now
Oh, I'll say it now
'Cuz I want it now When personality is scar tissue
We travel south with disuse
I'm subtle like a lion's cage
Such a cautious display
Remember take hold of, your time here
Give some meanings to the means
To your end
Not even jail We marshal in new days of longing
We tremble like anyone's children
And wink towards (wait to watch?) the fire I'm erring on this side of caution
Betraying no other symptom
But girl, you shake it right I will bounce you on the lap of silence
We will freeload to the beats of science
And girl, you shake it right I'll say it now Oh, but hold it still, darling, your hair's so pretty
Can't you feel the warmth of my sincerity?
You make motion when you cry
You're making people's lives feel less private
And don't take time away
You make motion when you cry
We all hold hands
Can we all hold hands
When we make new plans (friends?) I pretend like no one else
to try control myself
I'm subtle like a lion's cage
Such a cautious display
Remember take hold of, your time here
Give some meanings to the means
To your end
Not even jail I had seven faces
Thought I knew which one to wear
But I'm sick of spending these lonely nights
Training myself not to care Subway is a porno
The pavements they are a mess
I know you've supported me for a long time
Somehow I'm not impressed The New York cares
(Got to be some more change in my life)
New York cares
(Got to be some more change in my life) New York cares
(Got to be some more change in my life)
New York cares
(Got to be some more change in my life) Subway, she is a porno
And the pavements they are a mess
I know you've supported me for a long time
Somehow I'm not impressed It's up to me now turn on the bright lights
Oh it's up to me now turn on the bright lights New York cares
(Got to be some more change in my life)
New York cares
(Got to be some more change in my life) New York cares
(Got to be some more change in my life)
New York cares
(Got to be some more change in my life) It's up to me now turn on the bright lights
(Got to be some more change in my life)
(Got to be some more change in my life)
Oh, it's up to me now turn on the bright lights
(Got to be some more change in my life)
(Got to be some more change in my life) I want your silent parts
The parts the birds love
I know there's such a place
I had my back turned
You didn't realize
I'm lonely
You lack the things
To which I relate
But I see no harm
Come wait, come wait, come wait
It's over
One
Two
Three
Do me
When I'm feeling lazy, it's probably because
I'm saving all my energy to pick up when you move into my airspace
You move into my airspace
And something's coming over me, I see you in the doorway
I can't control the part of me that swells up when you move into my airspace
You move into my airspace
But each night
I bury my love around you
Oh each night
I bury my love around you
You're linked to my innocence
This is a concept
This is a bracelet
This isn't no intervention
This is a concept
This is a bracelet
This isn't no intervention
This isn't you yet
What you thought was such a conquest
Your hair is so pretty and red
Baby, baby you're really the best
Can I get there this way?
I think so
Can I get there this way?
I think so
Can I get there this way?
Can I get there this way?
Can I get there this way?
Can I get there this way?
We should take a trip now to see new places
I'm sick of this town
I see my face has changed
We should take a trip now to see new places
I'm sick of this town
I see my face has changed
Say hello
Say hello
To the angels
Say hello
Say hello
To the angels When she walks down the street
She knows there's people watching
The building fronts are just fronts
To hide the people watching her She once fell through the street
Down a manhole in that bad way
The underground drip
Was just like her scuba day Days
Daze
Days
Daze
Days She was all right 'cause the sea was so airtight, she broke away
She was all right 'cause the sea was so airtight, she broke away
She was all right but she can't come out tonight, she broke away
She was all right, 'cause the sea was so tight
Airtight She broke away, broke away
She broke away, broke away
She broke away, broke away
She broke away She hides in no place
She hides in no where At the bottom of the ocean she dwells
At the bottom of the ocean she dwells
Her caresses caressed by fingers
And fat blue serpent swells Stella
Stella
Oh, Stella
Stella I love you
Stella I love you
Stella I love you She was all right 'cause the sea was so airtight, she broke away
She was all right 'cause the sea was so airtight, she broke away
She was all right but she can't come out tonight, she broke away
She was all right, yeah the sea was so tight
Airtight She broke away, broke away
She broke away, broke away
She broke away, broke away
She broke away Well, she was my catatonic sex-toy-love-joy-diver
Well, she was my catatonic sex-toy-love-drug-diver
She went down down down there into the sea
And she went down down down there, down there for me, right on Oh yeah, right on, it's so good
Oh yeah, right on, it's so good
Oh yeah There's something that's invisible
There's some things you can't hide
Try to detect you when I'm sleeping
In a wave you say goodbye Heinrich Maneuver
How are things on the west coast?
I hear you're moving real fine
You wear those shoes like a dove
Now strut those shoes we go roaming in the night
Well how are things on the west coast?
You keep it moving to your soul's delight
Now I've tried the brakes
I tried but you know it's a lonely ride
How are things the west coast?
Oh I'd move heaven behind those eyes Today my heart swings
Yeah today my heart swings
But I don't want to take your heart
And I don't want a piece of history
No, I don't want to read your thoughts anymore
My god
'Cause today my heart swings
Yeah today my heart swings How are things on the west coast?
Hear you're moving real fine tonight
You wear those shoes side to side
Ah, strut those shoes
We'll go roaming in the night
Well how are things on the west coast?
Yeah but you're an actress
I don't identify Today my heart swings
Yeah today my heart swings
Say it
But I don't want to play the part
And I don't want a taste of victory
No, I don't want to read your thoughts anymore,
My God
'Cause today my heart swings

Let it come.
Well I've got a chance for a sweet sane life

Well I've got a plan with forward in my eyes But today my heart swings Surprise sometimes
Will come around
Surprise sometimes
Will come around I will surprise you sometime
I'll come around
I will surprise you sometime
I'll come around when you're down Show me the dirt pile
And I will pray that the soul can take
Three stowaways Vanish with no guile
And I will not pay
But the soul can wait
The soul can wait It is still pretty
What with all these leaves
We'll be fine
We'll be fine But if it's still pretty
What with all these leaves
We'll be fine, oh
And supervise Show me the dirt pile
And I will pray that the soul can take
Three stowaways Then you vanish with no guile
And I will not pay
But the soul can wait
I felt you so much today I know you try
You try straight into my heart
You fly straight into my heart
Girl, I know you try
You fly straight into my heart
You fly straight into my heart
But here comes the fall So much for make believe, I'm not sold
So much of dreams, deceit, I'm not prepared to know
Your heart makes me feel
Your heart makes me bold
For always and ever, I'll never let go
Always concealed
Safe and inside, alive
Show me the dirt pile
And I will pray that the soul can take
Three stowaways
In a passion it broke, I pull the black from the grey
But the soul can wait
I felt you so much today All that I see
Show me your ways
Teach me to meet my desires
With some grace All that I fear, don't turn away
And leave me to plead
In this hole of a place
What if I never break
Estuary won't you take me
Far away, far away All that I seek
Please police me
I want you to police me
But keep it clean Now that you meet my day
Now let's take them away
(That's why I hold you)
Strong as you've seen Old as you behave
(That's why I hold you)
You will always obey
(That's why I hold you) All that I feel, capital ways
Teach me to grieve and conspire
With my age All that I can see
A gold mystic spree
A seething routine
I could never navigate
Maybe I like to stray No harm it seems to be less so free, not today
It's like you want it that way All that I see
Is peaceful eyes drawn away from me
Drawn away from me We would like to take the sights
(That's why I hold you)
And bring silence in disguise
(That's why I hold you, dear) We would like to meet the buyer
(That's why I hold you)
That is on your life That's why I hold you
That's why I hold you
That is why I hold you
That's why I hold you
That is why I hold you, dear That's why I hold you
That's why I hold you, dear
That's why I hold you
That's why I hold you, dear That's why I hold you
That is why I hold you, dear
That's why I hold you
That is why I hold you, dear That's why I hold you
That is why I hold you, dear
That's why I hold you
That is why I hold you, dear That's why I hold you
That is why I hold you, dear
That's why I hold you I need the sunlight

And you're spelling out your love
You shouldn't be alone in there

If you're frustrated then go
If you're frustrated then go
Honey bee, you should be through with this,
your packaged eyes, your vicious lips,
You could be young, but you're out of touch
If this love's been done, then what's your rush? I'm a specialist in hope and I'm registered to vote
Why don't you come into my barrio
We'll see if we can float
I'm a specialist in hope and I'm registered to vote
Why don't you come into my barrio
We'll see if you can float Truly, truly, truly here Enter the override, how we run the day
Sleeker and cheaper, the wind changed
Following deeper, they do what I say
Spectral incentives, have paved the way Everything is wrong, wrong,
Everything is wrong
I guess we open time, what is now is overcome Truly, truly, truly I think I know why, I say what I say
Inverse achievements, I rule the daze
Am I more soulful? Am I coming down now?
Can we start over as agents of peace? Everything is wrong, wrong, everything is wrong
All we have is time, but my heart is going wrong
We're taking a part of both of us, but nobody likes to wait
Everything is wrong, truly wrong, everything is wrong
Everything is wrong Truly, truly, truly Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on We made our home, without begging a pardon
We made our home, with time alone
It's taking apart the best of us, and nobody likes to wait Everything is wrong, truly wrong, everything is wrong I'm gonna pull you in close
Gonna wrap you up tight
Gonna play with the braids
That you came here with tonight
I'm gonna hold your face
And toast the snow that fell
Because friends don't waste wine
When there's words to sell I feel like love is in the kitchen
with a culinary eye
I think he's making something special
and I'm smart enough to try
If you don't trust yourself
For at least one minute each day
Well you should trust in this, girl
'Cause loving is coming our way If you can fix me up, girl
We'll go a long way (Take my love in real small doses)
I'll stand by all this drinking if it helps me through these days
It takes a long time just to get this all straight
I'll showcase on Route 7 when I find the right place
It takes a long time just to get this all straight
In my mind
This is my free-time Because friends don't waste wine
When there's words to sell If you can fix me up, girl
We'll go a long way (Take my love in real small doses)
I'll stand by all this drinking if it helps me through these days
I spent a long time corresponding in my own way
I'll showcase on Route 7 when I find the right place
It takes a long time just to get this all straight
In my mind
This is my free-time
To let it all away Spend it all today It took time
Then I found you Will you put my hands away?
Will you be my man?
Serve it up, don't wait
Let's see about this ham Oh, what happened? Home spun desperation's knowing
Inside your cover's always blown Saw you from the urchin's side, from under the boat
Saw you making knots, saw you get the rope
The boy appearing on the deck and making it lurch
And bubble of your interests ready to burst He whistles and he runs Saw you in distraction, a sleeping slow despair
Rehearsing interaction, he wasn't even there
A creature is a creature though you wish you were the wind
The boat will not stop moving if you tie him up until the end He whistles and he runs so hold him fast
Breathe the burn, you want to let it last
He might succumb to what you haven't seen
He has a keen eye for what you used to be When the cadaverous mob saves its doors for the dead men
You cannot leave This could be destiny, oh sweetheart
I've had no sense of time since we started
I've got friends in need, oh sweetheart
I'd grown lengths and lengths and lengths of love since we started this thing out Combat salacious removal There is a bitter breed, oh sweetheart
They will be watching you sometimes with their bitter hearts
But we are through with these
Oh, we're shifting the heartache
We want strong summer love, the most robust of blood
Just to stay awake Combat salacious removal If time is my vessel
Then learning to love might be my way back to sea
The flying, the metal, the turning above
These are just ways to be seen
We all get paid
Yeah some get faith before they die
Then through stars we will navigate
Through the holes in your eyes How many days will it take to land
How many ways to reach abandon
Abandon Oh, so swoon, baby, starry nights
May our bodies remain
You move with me, I'll treat you right, baby
May our bodies remain There is love to be made
So just stay here for this while
Perhaps heartstrings resuscitate
The fading sounds of your life How many days will it take to land
How many ways to reach abandon
Oh, abandon So swoon, baby, starry nights
May our bodies remain
As deep we move I'll feed you light, baby
May our bodies remain
Oh yeah, in history I'll treat you right, baby
I'm honest that way, hey Swoon, baby, starry nights
May our bodies remain We ain't going to the town
We're going to the city
Gonna trek this shit around
And make this place a heart to be a part of We ain't going to the town
We're going to the city
Gonna trek this shit around
And make this place a heart to be a part of again We're going
We're going
We're going
And we're gone
We're going
We're going
We're going
And we're gone So baby make it with me
In preparation for tonight
We've got so much to leave
But that's not what makes this right
We've been building up steam
Ignited by this fight
So do this thing with me instead of
Tying on a tight one tonight We're going
We're going
We're going
And we're gone We ain't going to the town
We're going to the city
Gonna trek this shit around
And make this place a heart to be a part of again Day by day, we watch the gold ball.
Save the feeling, see you when you're going for,
you're truly at the door
of some great admiration. Oh, what a sweet serenade,
and the night is still young.
Oh, there's a flood coming soon,
and it rushes me just like a... Last Friday, I see you in the photo booth
You changed your name,
the screen really takes to you.
Will you really make it through
on some great accolades? Oh, what a sweet serenade,
and the night is still young for a...
there's a flood coming soon,
and it rushes me just like a tidal wave,
a tidal wave, a tidal wave, a tidal wave. Oh, there's a flood coming soon,
and the night is still young for a...
Feel the tug of the moon,
completely gone on a tidal wave,
a tidal wave, a tidal wave, a tidal wave (Completely gone on a) tidal wave,
a tidal wave,
(Completely gone on a) tidal wave,
a tidal wave,
(Completely gone on a) tidal wave,
a tidal wave,
(Completely gone on a) tidal wave,
a tidal wave,
(Completely gone on a)... Yours is the only version of my desertion
That I could ever subscribe to
That is all that I can do
You are a past sinner the last winner
I'm raping all around me
Until the last drop is behind you But you're so cute when you're frustrated, dear
Yeah, you're so cute when you're sedated, dear
I'm resting Sleep tight, dream right, we have two hundred couches where you can
Sleep tight, dream right, we have two hundred couches where you can
Sleep tight, dream right, we have two hundred couches where you can
Sleep tonight, sleep tonight, sleep tonight, sleep tonight You are the only person who's completely certain
There's nothing here to be into
That is all that you can do
You are a past sinner, the last winner
And everything we've come to
Makes you you But you cannot safely say
While I will be away but you will not consider sadly
How you helped me to stray
You will not reach me I am, resenting a position
That is past resentment and now I can consider
And now there is this distance so Sleep tight, grim right, we have two hundred couches where you can
Sleep tight, grim right, we have two hundred couches where you can
Sleep tight, grim right, we have two hundred couches where you can
Sleep tonight, sleep tonight, sleep tonight, sleep tonight Something to say
Something to do
Nothing to say
When there's nothing to do Shh
C'mon, c'mon My best friend's a butcher, he has sixteen knives
He carries them all over the town at least he tries.
Oh look it stopped snowing.
My best friend's from Poland and, um, he has a beard.
But they caught him with his case in that public place
That is what we had feared He severed segments secretly you like that
He always took the time to speak with me
I liked him for that
He severed segments so secretly you liked that
He always took the time, he always took the time C'mon now, pussycat My friend's a butcher, he has sixteen knives

What safety can you find
If the sea was that strong
Maybe we had, maybe we had to fly Was a good try
I'm a good guy As high as the day
I read the papers
Before crime will pay
I'll learn to bury most beliefs I have succeeded
I won't believe for long
I'm not supposed to show you
I've got two secrets
But I only told you one Dreams of long life
What safety can you buy
If the sea was that strong
Maybe we had, maybe we had to fly Somebody make me say no no

And it raised me Suele tener
Me suelto
Me suelto en el deshacer
Al puro perder el ganar no compara
Al puro perder el ganar no compara Please, please
The place we're in now
Please I will wait We saw you from the ocean's side, from under the boat
We saw you making knots, we saw you get the rope
The boy's appearing on the deck and making it lurch
And the bubble of your interests ready to burst He whistles and he runs We saw you in distraction: a sleeping, slow despair
Rehearsing interaction, he wasn't even there
A creature is a creature though you wish you were the wind
A boat will not stop moving if you tie him up until the end He whistles and he runs so hold him fast
Breathe the burn, you want to let it last
He might succumb to what you haven't seen
He has a keen eye for what you used to be When the cadaverous mob
Saves its doors for the dead men
You cannot leave. Spare me the suspense

So cold in the pitch night
Alone you can't make amends
No, I won't let you sit by

A taste
A taste
And it's time But I won't let you sit by
So cold in the pitch night
Alone you can't make amends
No, I won't let you sit by
So cold in the pitch night
It's enough with this fucking incense Just spare me the suspense There are seven ancient pawn shops along the road
Oh, I know seven aging daddies you may want to know
When you played your heart out
It made me turn around Oh, right on Wait and you froze in the night
You're late

No haste
No lesson, no lie
Got a taste
That I can't deny

I'm a specialist in hope and I'm registered to vote
Why don't you come into my barrio we'll see if you can float I'm not the hero out the gates
So much to feel, so much to gain
My higher reason will take aim
I'll be okay, I've got my shapes
We are not alone we share our stake
I think the winter will be wonderful I am safe without it
I am safe without it
I am safe without
I am safe without it
I am safe without it
I am safe without Go alone, we'll skip the chase
It's go the road or drop the weight
There's no allegiance left to take
As great big sheets disintegrate
In the water, in the water I am safe without it
I am safe without it
I am safe without
I am safe without it
I am safe without it
I am safe without I am safe without it
I am safe without it
I am safe without I am safe without it
I am safe without it
I am safe without
But I feel this way
Feel this way I steal, I heal and I do it again
Over and over and over and over I have a sequin for an eye
Pick a rose and hide my face
This is the bandit's life
It comes and goes and them's the breaks
Under a molten sky, beyond the road, we lie in wait
You think they know us now?
Wait 'til the stars come out
You see that
Well, I made you and now I take you back
It's too late but today I can define the lack
I made you and now I take you back Sun, you sleep in clouds of fire
That's all and that's right
My sun, you sleep in clouds of fire
That's all and that's right I can still feel it when you lie
Pick a rose just to hide my face
Well, if there's something I should know
I seek no science when there is no shape
Under a molten sky, let the days collide
Well, I made you and now I take you back Sun, you sleep in clouds of fire
That's all and that's right
My sun, you sleep in clouds of fire
That's all and that's right Can it be true?
Nobody warned you.
Nobody told you,
to make up your mind. Nobody told you,
That I could just waltz through
And shake up your style. I'm inside
Like a wrecking ball through your eyes
And I change it all from inside. Strange and far
All this hardware
Sum of time
And night one's for me Go inside
Going somewhere
Hopeless tag time
No one's for me
Open wide
Yard like new year Nobody warned you
Nobody told you
To make up your mind Nobody told you
That I could just walk through
And shake up your style Strange and far
All this hardware
Stroke of time
And no one's for me Go inside
Going somewhere
Hopeless tag time
And no one's for me
Open wide
Yard like new year Stay and fight
Stay and fight
Stay and fight you can't sit up
you fell too fast
you come at the right time
you come too fast
you bloom in spring
you move the sky
you've come in singing

the love the hate the things that separate
forcing conscious to conscious every small attack
it takes a small man to notice but not to act up
confrontation complication needs a foundation
I'm calm baby, I'm calm you were like a cloud

start again butterfly
start again butterfly
start again butterfly
start again, start again dear Oh
Fuck the ancient ways
They are heretofore
Show no claim Oh
Got the time, won't seek
They are oh still coming to beat the street
(At the station) The city feeds us all like babes
And we've taken a bow (At the station) Oh
Shape the fight of sound
Become beautifully bound
To pound Oh
Fuck the ancient ways
They are ringing doorbells that let in my waste
(At the station) The city needs us and all our rage
And surprise in your eyes (At the station) What we need, this empire grows
Every stage we'll find (At the station) To be beaten by the weight of it
They are to be beaten by the weight (At the station) Come in people and enjoy the glow
Every change we allow (At the station) The city sees us all like babes
And we've taken a bow (At the station) To be beaten by the weight of it
They are beaten by the weight (At the station) Should we seek them for the sake of it?
Nay, we greet them right away I'm gonna pull you in close
Gonna wrap you up tight
Gonna play with the braids
That you came here with tonight
I'm gonna hold your face
And toast the snow that fell
Because friends don't waste wine
When there's words to sell I feel like love is in the kitchen
with a culinary eye
I think he's making something special
and I'm smart enough to try
If you don't trust yourself
For at least one minute each day
Well you should trust in this, girl
'Cause loving is coming our way If you can fix me up, girl
We'll go a long way
If you can fix me up, girl
We'll go a long way I'll stand by all this drinking if it helps me through these days (Take my love in real small doses)
It takes a long time just to get this all straight (Take my love in real small doses)
I'll showcase on Route 7 when I find the right place (Take my love in real small doses)
It takes a long time just to get this all straight (Take my love in real small doses)
In my mind
This is my free-time Because friends don't waste wine
When there's words to sell If you can fix me up, girl
We'll go a long way I'll stand by all this drinking if it helps me through these days (Take my love in real small doses)
I spent a long time corresponding in my own way (Take my love in real small doses)
I'll showcase on Route 7 when I find the right place (Take my love in real small doses)
It takes a long time just to get this all straight (Take my love in real small doses)
In my mind
This is my free-time
To let it all away Spend it all today It took time
Then I found you It would be so nice to take you
I only ever try to make you smile
No matter what
We're gonna keep you occupied
But only at your place
Only at your place It would be no price to pay
I only ever lie to make you smile
All kinds of dust
Are gonna keep me satisfied
But only at your place
Only at your place Tonight a special memory serves me
And I'll wait to find the wrong way
Tonight a special memory serves me
And I'll wait to find It's over, it's over
Feels like, the feeling is like
It's over
Why is it so hard to stay away? Tonight a special memory serves me
And I'll wait to find that I'm gray
Tonight is special
I only memorize those things I deny
And I forget why it'll sing, seize the day Don't have to say that you'd love to
But they'd be pleased that you want to
Someday It would be no price to pay
It would be no price to pay Don't have to say that you'd love to
But they'd be pleased that you want to
Someday Don't have to say that you'd love to
But they'd be pleased that you want to
Someday You don't have to say that you'd love to
But they'd be pleased that you want to
Someday I had seven faces
Thought I knew which one to wear
But I'm sick of spending these lonely nights

Gonna rain again today
There's a devil at your side
But an angel on her way Someone hit the light
'Cause there's more here to be seen
When you caught my eye
I saw everywhere I'd be
And wanna go to You came on your own
That's how you'll leave
With hope in your hands
And air to breathe I won't disappoint you
As you fall apart
Some things should be simple
Even an end has a start Someone hit the light
'Cause there's more here to be seen
When you caught my eye
I saw everywhere I'd be
And wanna go to You came on your own
That's how you'll leave
With hope in your hands
And air to breathe
You lose everything
By the end
Still my broken limbs
You find time to mend More and more people I
Know are getting ill
Pull something good from the
Ashes now be still You came on your own
That's how you'll leave
With hope in your hands
And air to breathe
You lose everything

That's how you'll leave
You came on your own
That's how you'll leave You came on your own

So your eyes cant see
Now run as fast as you can
Through this field of trees Say goodbye to everyone
You have ever known
You are not gonna see them ever again I cant shake this feeling Ive got
My dirty hands, have I been in the wars?
The saddest thing that Id ever seen
Were smokers outside the hospital doors Someone turn me around
Can I start this again? How can we wear our smiles
With our mouths wide shut
Cause you stopped us from singin I cant shake this feeling Ive got
My dirty hands, have I been in the wars?
The saddest thing that Id ever seen
Were smokers outside the hospital doors Someone turn me around
Can I start this again?
Now someone turn us around
Can we start this again? Weve all been changed
From what we were
Our broken parts
Left smashed off the floor I cant believe you
If I cant hear you

If I cant hear you Weve all been changed
From what we were
Our broken parts
Smashed off the floor Weve all been changed
From what we were
Our broken parts

Can I start this again?
(Our broken parts smashed off the floor)
Now someone turn us around
(Weve all been changed from what we were)

(Our broken parts smashed off the floor) This pace is set to break
It's just too safe for me outside tonight
And I want that
I face the storms at the time from the lighthouse And I want that
And waste the storm and the night, oh What do the waves have to say now?
What do the waves have to say now, now? Slow down
And let the waves have their way now, now
Slow
And let the waves have their day And I want that Here I've been living and losing from sin
I pulled it out now, begin, begin
Here I've been losing and living within
Inwardly urgent and sinking again
The lighthouse I will still be up by fall
I'll still be up by fall either way
Still be up by fall
I'll be still to hear the call either way Street of thought
In all your bones
Hold your place and
Save your throne
Lie awake supine and golden
Wait for grace
It's time Mind over time
Mind over time Sleight of fate
And borrowed clothes
Songs of places
No one knows
Draped in lace we all lean over
To greet the great
It's time Mind over time
Mind over time Street of thought
In all your bones
Hold your place
And save your throne
Lie awake supine and golden
Greet the great its time Mind over time
Mind over time
It's mind over time
It's your mind over time I dream of you draped in wires
And leaning on the breaks
As I leave you with restless liars and dealers on the take
And I can read you like a gun
She watched this meeting hall, sweat and shake!
I'll take you on
I'll take you on
I'll take you on
I'll take you all on
I'll take you on
Oh, I'll take you on
I'll take you on
I'll take you on I will stride you with desire of fault line
No crutch, no stall.
And I can bind you with no ties and leash and watch you fall You see I've got this soul, it's all fired up
This soul, I've got this soul, it's all fired up
This soul, it's all fired up
It's all fired up
It's all fired up
It's all fired up I teach you of death's desires
Reflecting in lakes
As I lead you in a fearful file
To a precipice of fate
And I welcome you
I welcome your sweethearts that bleed and break!
I'll take you on
I'll take you on
I'll take you on
I'll take you all on
I'll take you on when your, your will is gone
I'll take you on
I'll take you on I will strike you with desire of fault lines
No crutch, no stall.
And I can bind you with no ties and lease time and watch you fall See, I've got this soul, it's all fired up
This soul, I've got this soul, it's all fired up
This soul, it's all fired up
It's all fired up
It's all fired up
It's all fired up
You're all mine You're all mine
You're all mine
You're all mine
You're all mine
You're all mine I wish I could live free
I hope it's not beyond me
Settling down, it takes time
One day we'll live together
And life will be better
I have it here, yeah, in my mind
Baby, you know someday you'll slow
And baby, my heart's been breaking I gave a lot to you
I take a lot from you, too
You slave a lot for me
Guess you could say I gave you my edge I can't pretend
I need to defend
Some part of me from you
I know I've spent some time lying
I can't pretend
I don't need to defend
Some part of me from you
I know I've spent some time lying 
How am I doing? You're looking all right tonight
I think we should go
You're looking all right tonight
I think we should go Always you need me, lover
For always release me, lover I want to give you the lowdown
I want to give you the face to face
Always is all I can give
Isn't quite what you take me for I'll act in a certain way
I control what I can
That's the man I am
Well, it pains me to say
And I do what I can
That's the man I am Always, always, always
Always release me, lover
I want to give you the face to face (Won't let you go)
(Won't let you go)
(What'll you do?)
I want to miss some more I'll relax in a certain way
I control what I can
That's the man I am
(Clearing out of the shade) Well, it pains me to say
And I do what I can
(Coming out of the rain)
That's the man I am
(Clearing out of the shade)
That's the man I am Coming out of the rain
Clearing out of the shade All that you've known
Be as it may
All that you've shown
Reach in and try all day
(Coming out of the rain)
I wanna try all day
(Clearing out of the shade) All that I've known is you'll be okay
Follow your soul and it tells you to fly away
(Coming out of the rain)
I wanna fly all day
(Clearing out of the shade) All that you've known
Be as it may
All that you've shone
Reach in and shine all day
(Coming out of the rain)
I wanna shine all day
(Clearing out of the shade) Slow decay
I won't stop fighting yet Who do you think that is there?
I came to fight
I am in the air
I know you follow the body
Let go now
To the coast of hypnotic we go I only call them
When I know
I don't see them Who do you think that is there?
I show beyond
So beyond compare
I always fall in these fights
I know why
Always fall in these fights
I know why
Controlling the agents takes a toll on my brain
Now who do you think that is there? Only call them
When I know
I don't see them
I only call them
When I know
I don't see them Slow decay
I won't Who do you think that is there?
By interest strike
Leading out of despair
I know you follow the body
Let go now
To the coast of hypnotic
That won't stop now
If making a taste for me
You're making your own way
Now who do you think
I said, who do you think now? Oh, how I pass the days
You know how much I care
Oh, through the wax and waning
You know I will be there
Oh, at your faded grace
I know now not to swear Slow decay
I won't stop fighting yet Who do you think that is there?
I came to fight
I am in the air
I always fall in these fights
I know why
And from the birth strings of life
I go right
But controlling the agents takes a toll on my brain
Now who do you think that is there? Only call them
When I know
I don't see them
I only call them
When I know
I don't see them Will you put my hands away?
Will you be my man?
Serve it up, don't wait
Let's see about this ham Oh, what happened? Home spun desperation's knowing
Inside your cover's always blown Surprise sometimes
Will come around
Surprise sometimes
Will come around I will surprise you sometime
I'll come around
I will surprise you sometime
I'll come around when you're down Saw you from the ocean side
From under the boat
We saw you making knots
We saw you get the rope The boy appearing on the deck
And making it lurch
The bubble of your interest
Ready to burst He whistles and he runs We saw you in distraction
A sleeping slow despair
Rehearsing interaction
He wasn't even there A creature is a creature
Though you wish you were the wind
A boat will not stop moving
If you tie him up until the end He whistles and he runs so hold him fast
Breathe the burn, you want to let it last
He might succumb to what you haven't seen
He has a keen eye for what you used to be When the cadaverous mob
Saves its doors for the dead man
You cannot leave When the cadaverous mob
Saves its doors for the dead man
You cannot leave When the cadaverous mob
Saves its doors for the dead man
You cannot leave Tell me you're mine
Tell me you're mine to break the ice Does he make you smile?
Does he fully embrace the way
Does he leave you to the flames
That you like, who is this guy? This twee neophyte
Does he know that I'll wait for all time
Does he make you right
Does he say that he'd like to know you
Does he say that he wants to know All of the ways
You will make it up
Make it up for me
Make it up for me Tell me you're fine
Tell me it's hard to fake it time after time
Who is this guy
Does he say that he'd like to know you
Does he say that he wants to know
Does he say that he wants to know All of the ways
You will make it up
Make it up for me
Make it up for me All of the ways

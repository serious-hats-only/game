I dream of the Euromillions, I dreamed I scoop the lot
And I have two words for my boss and the second one is off.
But I had fifty lucky dips (Can't work out what he says here)
Which one of you's allowed to stamp my passport out of here. Shine
Shine the light of luck on me tonight.
I want you to shine, shine the light of luck on me tonight (Let's go) I have already spent it ten times over in my head,
I'd swap this Fiat Punto for a yacht down on the Med.
Of course I'd see my mother (can't work out what he says here)
But I'd see my fair weathered friends more than I'd go for Mums Shine
Shine the light of luck on me tonight.
I want you to shine, shine the light of luck on me tonight I've spent eight gas bills with change on big thunderballs.
But none of my numbers have come up at all.
Life is a lottery, we play if we like and old lady luck might be shining her light. Shine a light
Shine a light
Shine a light
Shine a light
Shine
Shine the light of luck on me tonight.
Shine
Shine the light of luck on me tonight.
Shine a light (Repeats) I dream of the Euromillions, I dreamed I scoop the lot
And I have two words for my boss and the second one is off.
But I had fifty lucky dips (Can't work out what he says here)
Which one of you's allowed to stamp my passport out of here. Shine

Shine a light (Repeats) Your girls got you wrapped around her finger
And your girl is the reason you don't ring us
All your excuses leave us no doubt
You've sacked us off
And you don't wanna come out
Because we know what it is that really stops you
You don't go but you'll be sorry when she drops you
Your girl is the one who wears the trousers
And your girl's got you trapped inside the house and
You're a two headed monster, you talk as a we
We'll all be out you'll be watching TV
Cos you're girl is the one who wears the trousers We've took to calling you the pilot light
Because you won't be going out tonight
You'll be with your girl Tell me what are we doing here?
You control all my strings
Like a puppeteer
I'm a ship lost at sea
But I'm yours to steer
An actor in your play Tell me what do you want from me
I'm at your disposal as you can see
I'm but a leaf blowing in your breeze
A pawn in your game I'd do anything for you
Pussycat what's new?
I'd even spy for you
I spy for you Hit me sudden like a heart attack
I'm in too deep
And there's no turning back
No one I know ever understands
The lengths we go to just to please a woman You are the cause
I'm a consequence
Yours to control from this moment hence
I won't blink in the sunlight of your gaze
Those who won't bend
Will be certain to break I'd do anything for you
Pussycat what's new?
I'd even spy for you
I spy for you Hit me sudden like a heart attack
I'm in too deep
And there's no turning back
No one I know ever understands
The lengths we go to just to please a woman I'll be the beach and you be the sea, I want you to wash all over me
I'll be the beach and you'll be the sea, I want you to wash all over me
I'll be the beach and you be the sea, I want you to wash all over me
I'll be the beach and you'll be the sea, I want you to wash all over me
I'll be the branches while you be the breeze, bend and shape me anyway you please.
I'll be the beach and you be the sea, I want you to wash all over me
I'll be the beach and you'll be the sea, I want you to wash all over me
All over me
All over me
All over me. Send me postcards from the coast, my friend
Let's cartwheel down memory lane
One thousand words describing way back when
I wonder if you still remember Send me postcards of the coast, my friend
Think of me from time to time
If I think on, I might respond in kind
With something that you might remember You keep harping on while I'm your strings
To bend, contort, hold down and everything
When I'm no longer of use to you
You'll pack me in for someone new You keep harping on, while I get played
Though pointless we maintain this masquerade
My replacements waiting in the wings
But you're my harp and I'm your strings I want you to play me
Like you did before
Why don't you play me?
Play me like you used to do before You seem to want to bend me 'til I break
I'm dragged behind you, trailing in your wake
Though old and battered, worn and bruised
I'll still play my song for you If you'd just play me
Like you did before
Why don't you play me?
Play me like you used to do before Why don't you play me
Like you did before?
If you'd just play me
Play me like you used to do before I want you to make me feel like I'm the only one, the only one
I want you to make me feel like I'm the only one, the only one I may not be your first
But I wanna be your last
I wrote the chapter and the verse
On being haunted by the past
And I'mma slay that green-eyed monster as soon as I can
If I could kick the feeling I got that you're my brand new secondhand I want you to make me feel like I'm the only one, the only one
I want you to make me feel like I'm the only one, the only one About to go headlong into forging the future
But we know that we can't carry on with suspicious minds
And I'mma slay that green-eyed monster as soon as I can
You know in each and every way
You know in each and every way I want you to make me feel like I'm the only one, the only one
I want you to make me feel like I'm the only one, the only one I want you to make me feel like I'm the only one, the only one
I want you to make me feel like I'm the only one, the only one
I want you to make me feel like I'm the only one, the only one
I want you to make me feel like I'm the only one, the only one Rain'll fall, breeze'll blow
Everyone'll complain but it coulda been snow
All in all well you coulda got more
But you could got less
Don't let me hear you moan no more The sun might shine
The sky might be blue
Even the brightest day might still look grey to you Why do you flip? Why do you fight?
Why do you trip? Why do you bite?
Oh why when you could've been happy You're not sick you've got a life
You're alright you still wanna cry
Oh why when you could've been happy Some are gonna make stars
Some are gonna just try
And what did you expect
Don't act like you're surprised The sun might shine
The sky might be blue
Even the brightest day might still look grey to you Why do you flip? Why do you fight?
Why do you trip? Why do you bite?
Oh why when you could've been happy You're not sick you've got a life
You're alright you still wanna cry
Oh why when you could've been happy Emboldened by
A state of inebriation brought by a bottle of wine
But the feeling's fine
She's gyrating hips and all, when she stays that night Forgotten in a week
She remembered it in six She says, "I'm old enough to know better"
He says, "I'm cool enough not to care" And he became ensnared
When the meetings and the business trips gonna God knows where
Landed him right there
Backside on the bar stool now, will he take her upstairs? Forgotten in a week
She remembered him in six He says, "I'm old enough to know better"
She says, "I'm cool enough not to care" "I'm old enough to know better"
She says, "I'm cool enough not to care" "It's love" were the words that I heard her say
But love for another, not yours anyway
And the rumors start flyin' and you've been left cryin'
'Cause you were the last to know "It's not you, love, it's me", what a terrible way
To tell someone hurting that you're going away
And now you're realizing that she's just been lyin'
And you were the last to know Take a step back in time and look in from the outside
You'll see it's true
When they say that the world doesn't turn without reason
Though it's hard when you're the last to know And now you're realizing that she's just been lyin'
And you were the last to know
Yes, you were the last to know If the truth's to be told, it's just you best fit the mold
That she formed long ago
It's all a part of a plan, obtain the house then the man
Before she gets too old She's gonna swallow you whole
'Cause she's a black widow Guess you've been wondering how, if we were younger than now
Would your world be a stage
Or does the slumber that comes from living under her thumbs
Render it all a cage She's gonna swallow you whole
'Cause she's a black widow There's only one prognosis, anybody coming to
She got you via hypnosis, she got the claws in you
There's only one prognosis, anybody coming to
She got you via hypnosis, she got the claws in you I needed
I needed
Yeah, I needed
I needed somebody to lay me down You should have a warning
You should be certified
'Cause you're a want inside, in the night
The Lord knows that I've tried You should have a black mask
Striped jersey and all
I guess you should have a bag full of swag
It's a fact I can't help it at all I needed
I needed
I needed
I needed somebody to lay me down
I needed somebody to lay me down I called you in the morning
I had the feeling inside
Content to lay flat on my back
Knowing that might last me 'til the night And I called you in the night time
When my feeling was high
It's half three, but can't you see?
'Cause I need you to leave on your light I needed
Yeah, I needed
I needed
I needed somebody to lay me down
I just needed somebody to lay me down You understate ya
Bit of a taste for
Everything's lowest common denominator
Oh but you're a waiter
A calculator
There must be some way
I can hit your detonator
Your detonator... You're no agitator
More a spectator
Compare the two and maybe
Tell me what's the greater
So whatd'ya say to
Little bit later
I'll take you somewhere
We can hit your detonator
Your detonator... We all love a little nostalgia
It isn't what it used to be
Tamagotchi, Trolls and Crocodile Dundee
We're mad for a little nostalgia
They say there's money in this
What fool would want to forge the future now? Lala lala lala lala lala lala la

There's a four-letter word that'd better describe
How I feel and I might just fade away Save me
Save me
Save me from myself There's a trip you can take for a brief holiday in the mind
You should know we can go on a carpet ride
And I feel that I might just fade away Save me
Save me
Save me from myself You're a visitor if time is just a place
It's positively pointless if it goes to waste
Nelson will get his eye back though
Before we see you change
A lifetime spent sat sitting on the sideline Don't you wanna go outside in the sunshine sometimes Time waits for no man
It's the last bus home at night
Don't wake up old
And fight against the dimming of the lights
All our ships are sinking
But they take a while to go down
Don't spend your life sat sitting on the sideline Don't you wanna go outside in the sunshine sometimes Not all that you seek will prove itself to be
Paler than the promise of your wildest hopes and dreams You know that you're a visitor if time is just a place
Don't stand there in the shadows
With that look upon your face
In the furnace of the future
Lies the embers of the past
But you won't see that sat sitting on the sideline Don't you wanna go outside in the sunshine sometimes Is it the feeling or its absence really makes me blue
I can't reverse this curse brought on by the photographs of you
Though I cut you out of a Polaroid in an attempt to forget you
Declare all romance null and void, it seems you just won't let me We're two years over the time
When I should even bear you in mind
It's obvious to anyone I really must be stuck on you Like a leaf that might well fall forsaken by the spring
I'm the bird who summer left and might neglect to sing
As I brush you off, try and paint the town
Red to react with a rebound
I'm aware my eyes just let me down
I wonder where you could be now We're two years over the time
When I should even bear you in mind
It's obvious to anyone I really must be stuck on you
So obvious to anyone I really must be stuck on you Well, we're two years over the time
When I should even bear you in mind
It's obvious to anyone I really must be stuck on you
So obvious to anyone I really must be stuck on you Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah Laughter is infectious
You might be the cure In a haystack you would find the needle
To help burst our balloon
You're a dark cloud I pray for sunshine soon Mister Glassalfempty
Mister Under the Moon
Mister Melancholy
Sing me something new
Mister Glassalfempty
Mister Glassalfempty Yeah
Yeah There could be porcine aviation
You'd stay underwhelmed 'Cause you're a wet weekend in a month of Sundays
A listless source of gloom
You're a dark cloud I pray for sunshine soon Mister Glassalfempty
Mister Under the Moon
Mister Melancholy
Sing me something new
Mister Glassalfempty
Mister Glassalfempty And he saw her going out to the cinema tonight
When she told him she'd be probably staying in again to revise
Was it the warm of a hand on the cold of a gun?
The lick of the clip disturbed the air tonight June was wed to Steve, planned to get rid of him, they claim
It's clear the jury think the doubt is minimal, she's to blame
Was it a passionate crime, a rush to the head?
Or did she plot to shoot him down in flames? 'Cause I've killed Kennedys, Kings and Tsars
I did for Lennon, did for Hitler, did for Lee Oswald
And if your number's up, I don't care who you are
If my bang bang bang's coming
Ah, get running For Stu to get his dues on his inheritance, he conspired
To plan his Gran would soon get her deliverance, it transpires
That placing his hand on the gun would empty the funds
He plans to run to Timbuktu tonight 'Cause I've killed Kennedys, Kings and Tsars
I did for Gandhi, did for Hitler, did for Lee Oswald
And if your number's up, I don't care who you are
If my bang bang bang's coming
Ah, get running The sun that sets may also scorch
Like the weapon of choice for vengeful thoughts
When the Sundance Kid met his end, of course
It was me, who else could it be?
Who blasted him and Cassidy If you wanna know how to get there
(I know the way, I know the way, I know the way)
Like the back of my hand Everyone I know is making babies
So what about us?
What about us?
Everyone I know is making love, sweet love
What about us?
What about us? If you wanna surf the horizon
(Run away, I'll run away, I'll run away)
And we can leave here tonight Everyone I know is making babies
So what about us?
What about us?
Everyone I know is making love, sweet love
What about us?
What about us? Everyone I know is making babies
So what about us?
What about us?

You got me all subdued, deep in the darkest doom
I'm blue, and I'm in that mood
So blue, you know it's true
When I find you, I'll make it so that you'll be blue too Friends say I never dream or want to
Truth or lie, I maybe just switched on to
Every kind of different shade of blue
There's nowt I can do 'Cause I'm blue, I'm blue, I'm blue

When I find you, I'll make it so that you'll be blue too Why, why oh why
Do rumours rankle round? A moment alone spent
Far from a maddening crowd
A girl with a secret
Imparts to a friend out loud
The contents of a letter
Another lover's written down
Once gossip starts it shall recieve no end Why, why oh why
Do rumours rankle round? Armed with a secret
Jennifer couldn't keep quiet
And blabbed to her boyfriend
Who told all his mates that night
Dispense with the intrigue now
Somebody should let 'em know
Gossip is the Devil's Radio Why, why oh why
Do rumours rankle round? Weird looks in the local
Just serves to show
Gossip is the Devil's Radio
In the supermarket
At the school where your kids go
Gossip is the Devil's Radio Why, why oh why
Do rumours rankle round?

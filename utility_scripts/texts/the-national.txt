I am good, I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
I can't get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I need my girl
I need my girl Remember when you lost your shit and
Drove the car into the garden
And you got out and said I'm sorry
To the vines and no one saw it
I need my girl
I need my girl I'm under the gun again
I know I was the 45% of then
I know I was a lot of things
But I am good, I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
I can't get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I need my girl
I need my girl There's some things that I should never
Laugh about in front of family
In a week we'll be together
Try to call you when I'm landed
I need my girl
I need my girl Remember when you said I'm sorry
To the vines and no one saw it
I'll try to call you from the party
It's full of punks and cannonballers
I need my girl
I need my girl I'm under the gun again
I know I was the 45% of then
I know I was a lot of things
But I am good, I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
I can't get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I need my girl
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I need my girl
I keep feeling smaller and smaller It's a terrible love that I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love that I'm walking in
It's a terrible love that I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love that I'm walking in
It's quiet company, it's quiet company It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love that I'm walking in
It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love that I'm walking in
It's quiet company, it's quiet company
It's quiet company And I can't fall asleep
Without a little help
It takes awhile to settle down
My ship of hopes
Wait til the past? It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break Company
It's quite company
It's quiet company But I won't follow you into the rabbit hole
Last night I woke but then I saw
The ship of woes but didn't want me to It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love that I'm walking in
It's a terrible love that I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love that I'm walking in It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break Today
You were far away
And I
Didn't ask you why
What could I say
I was far away
You just walked away
And I just watched you
What could I say How close am I
To losing you Tonight
You just close your eyes
And I just watch you
Slip away How close am I
To losing you Hey, are you awake
Yeah I'm right here
Well can I ask you
About today How close am I
To losing you How close am I
To losing I was drifting, crying
I was looking for an island
I was slipping under
I'll pull the devil down with me one way or another I'm out of my mind; think you can wait?
I'm way off the line; think you can wait? We've been running a sleepless run
Been away from the baby way too long
We've been holding a good night gone
We've been losing our exits one by one I'm out of my mind; think you can wait?
I'm way off the line; think you can wait? Did I?
(all I have is all)
Think you can wait?
Did I?
(all I have is all)
Think you can wait? What I'm thinking is simple
I'll sell apples and ice water at the temple
I won't make trouble
I'll pull the devil down with me one way or another We've been running a sleepless run
Been away from the baby way too long
We've been holding a good night gone
We've been losing our exits one by one I'll try.
I'll try, but I couldn't be better.
(all I have is all)
I'll try, but I couldn't be better.

(all I have is all) I think the kids are in trouble
Do not know what all the troubles are for
Give them ice for their fevers
You're the only thing I ever want anymore
Live on coffee and flowers
Try not to worry what the weather will be
I figured out what we're missing
I tell you miserable things after you are asleep Now we'll leave the silver city 'cause all the silver girls
Gave us black dreams
Leave the silver city cause all the silver girls
Everything means everything It's a Hollywood summer
You never believe the shitty thoughts I think
Meet our friends out for dinner
When I said what I said I didn't mean anything
We belong in a movie
Try to hold it together 'til our friends are gone
We should swim in a fountain
Do not want to disappoint anyone Now we'll leave the silver city cause all the silver girls
Gave us black dreams
Leave the silver city to all the silver girls
Everything means everything I was afraid, I'd eat your brains
I was afraid, I'd eat your brains
Cause I'm evil
Cause I'm evil I'm a confident liar
Had my head in the oven so you'd know where I'll be
I'll try to be more romantic
I want to believe in everything you believe
But I was less than amazing
Do not know what all the troubles are for
Fall asleep in your branches
You're the only thing I ever want anymore Now we'll leave the silver city cause all the silver girls
Gave us black dreams
Leave the silver city to all the silver girls
Everything means everything I was afraid, I'd eat your brains
I was afraid, I'd eat your brains
Cause I'm evil
Cause I'm evil
Cause I'm evil I couldn't find quiet
I went out in the rain
I was just soakin' my head to unrattle my brain
Somebody said you disappeared in a crowd
I didn't understand then
I don't understand now Am I the one you think about when you're
Sitting in your faintin' chair drinking pink rabbits?
Am I the one you think about when you're
Sitting in your faintin' chair drinking pink rabbits? And everybody was gone
You were standin' in the street 'cause you were tryin' not to crack up
It wasn't like a rain it was more like a sea
I didn't ask for this pain it just came over me
I love a storm, but I don't love lightning
All the waters coming up so fast, that's right Am I the one you think about when you're
Sitting in your faintin' chair drinking pink rabbits?
Am I the one you think about when you're
Sitting in your faintin' chair drinking pink rabbits? And everybody was gone
I was standing in the street 'cause I was trying not to crack I was solid gold
I was in the fight
I was coming back from what seemed like a ruin
I couldn't see you coming so far
I just turn around and there you are I'm so surprised you want to dance with me now
I was just getting used to living life without you around
I'm so surprised you want to dance with me now
You always said I held you way too high off the ground You didn't see me I was falling apart
I was a white girl in a crowd of white girls in the park
You didn't see me I was falling apart
I was a television version of a person with a broken heart
You didn't see me I was falling apart
I was a white girl in a crowd of white girls in a park
You didn't see me I was falling apart
I was a television version of a person with a broken heart And everybody was gone
You were standin' in the street
Cause you were trying not to crack up
Now I only think about los angeles when the sun kicks out
Now I only think about los angeles when the sun kicks out You said it would be painless
The needle in the dark
You said it would be painless
It wasn't that at all
You said it would be painless
The needle in the dark
You said it would be painless
It wasn't that at all (when the sun kicks out) You said it would be painless
The needle in the dark (when the sun kicks out)
You said it would be painless
It wasn't that at all And who are you, the proud lord said
That I must bow so low?
Only a cat of a different coat
That's all the truth I know
In a coat of gold or a coat of red
A lion still has claws
And mine are long and sharp, my lord
As long and sharp as yours And so he spoke, and so he spoke
That lord of Castamere,
But now the rains weep o'er his hall
With no one there to hear
Yes, now the rains weep o'er his hall
And not a soul to hear And so he spoke, and so he spoke
That lord of Castamere
But now the rains weep o'er his hall
With no one there to hear
Yes, now the rains weep o'er his hall
And not a soul to hear Sorrow found me when I was young,
Sorrow waited, sorrow won.
Sorrow that put me on the pills,
It's in my honey it's in my milk.
It's only about half a heart alone
On the water,
Cover me in rag and bones, sympathy.
'Cause I don't wanna get over you.
I don't wanna get over you. Sorrows my body on the waves
Sorrows a girl inside my cage
I live in a city sorrow built
It's in my honey, it's in my milk.
It's only my half of heart alone,
On the water,
Cover me in rag and bones, sympathy.
'Cause I don't wanna get over you.
I don't wanna get over you. It's only my half of heart alone,
On the water,
Cover me in rag and bones, sympathy. 'Cause I don't wanna get over you. Stay out super late tonight
Picking apples, making pies
Put a little something in our lemonade
And take it with us We're half awake in a fake empire
We're half awake in a fake empire Tiptoe through our shiny city
With our diamond slippers on
Do our gay ballet on ice
Bluebirds on our shoulders We're half awake in a fake empire
We're half awake in a fake empire Turn the light out, say goodnight
No thinking for a little while
Let's not try to figure out everything at once
It's hard to keep track of you falling through the sky We're half awake in a fake empire
We're half awake in a fake empire We expected something, something better than before
We expected something more Do you really think you can just put it in a safe
Behind a painting, lock it up and leave?
Do you really think you can just put it in a safe
Behind a painting, lock it up and leave?
Walk away now and you're gonna start a war Whatever went away, I?ll get it over now
I?ll get money, I?ll get funny again
Whatever went away, I?ll get it over now
I?ll get money, I?ll get funny again
Walk away now and you're gonna start a war We expected something, something better than before
We expected something more You were always weird but I never had to hold you
By the edges, like I do now
We were always weird but I never had to hold you
By the edges, like I do now
Walk away now and you're gonna start a war Whatever went away, I?ll get it over now
I?ll get money, I?ll get funny again
Whatever went away, I?ll get it over now
I?ll get money, I?ll get funny again
Walk away now and you're gonna start a war
Walk away now and you're gonna start a war There's no saving anything
Now we're swallowing the shine of the sun
There's no saving anything
How we swallow the sun But I won't be no runaway
Cause I won't run
No, I won't be no runaway What makes you think I'm enjoying being led to the flood?
We've got another thing coming undone
And it's taking us over We don't bleed when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead, throw your arms in the air tonight
We don't bleed when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead, lose our shirts in the fire tonight What makes you think I'm enjoying being led to the flood?
We got another thing coming undone But I won't be no runaway
Cause I won't run
No, I won't be no runaway
Cause I won't run
No, I won't be no runaway What makes you think I'm enjoying being led to the flood?

Go ahead, go ahead, lose our shirts in the fire tonight But what makes you think I'm enjoying being led to the flood?
We got another thing coming undone
We got another thing coming undone
And it's taking forever I'll go braving everything
With you swallowing the shine of the sun
I'll go braving everything
Through the shine of the sun But I won't be no runaway
Cause I won't run
No, I won't be no runaway
Cause I won't run
No, I won't be no runaway What makes you think I'm enjoying being led to the flood?
We've got another thing coming undone

Go ahead, go ahead, lose our shirts in the fire tonight But what makes you think I'm enjoying being led to the flood?
We got another thing coming undone
We got another thing coming undone
And it's taking us over
And it's taking forever Then I'm radio and then I'm television
I'm afraid of everyone, I'm afraid of everyone
Lay the young blue bodies, with the old red violets
I'm afraid of everyone, I'm afraid of everyone
With my kid on my shoulders I try
Not to hurt anybody I like
But I don't have the drugs to sort,
I don't have the drugs to sort it out, sort it out I defend my family with my orange umbrella
I'm afraid of everyone, I'm afraid of everyone
With my shiny new star spangled tennis shoes on
I'm afraid of everyone, I'm afraid of everyone
With my kid on my shoulders I try
Not to hurt anybody I like
But I don't have the drugs to sort,
I don't have the drugs to sort it out, sort it out
I don't have the drugs to sort it, sort it out, sort it out Your voice has stolen my soul, soul, soul
Your voice has stolen my soul, soul, soul
Your voice has stolen my soul, soul, soul

Soul soul soul soul soul
Your voice has stolen my soul, soul, soul
Soul soul soul soul soul Oh, when I lift you up
You feel like a hundred times yourself
I wish everybody knew
What's so great about you Oh, but your love is such a swamp
You don't think before you jump
And I said I wouldn't get sucked in
I This is the last time Oh, don't tell anyone I'm here
I've got time and no one near
I was thinking that you'd call somebody
Closer to you Oh, but your love is such a swamp
You're the only thing I want
And I said I wouldn't cry about it
I This is the last time
This is the last time We were so under the brine
We were so vacant and kind
We were so under the brine
We were so vacant We were so under the brine
We were so out of our minds
We were so under the brine
We were so vacant Oh, when I lift you up
You feel like a hundred times yourself
I wish everybody knew
What's so great about you Oh, but your love is such a swamp
You don't think before you jump
And I said I wouldn't get sucked in
I I won't be vacant anymore
I won't be waitin' anymore
I won't be vacant anymore
I won't be waitin' anymore
I won't be vacant anymore
I won't be waitin' anymore
I won't be vacant anymore
I won't be waitin' anymore Jenny, I am in trouble
Can't get these thoughts out of me
Jenny, I'm seeing double
I know this changes everything Jenny, I am in trouble
Can't get these thoughts out of me
Jenny, I'm seeing double
I know this changes everything Standing at the punch table, swallowing punch
Can't pay attention to the sound of anyone
A little more stupid, a little more scared
Every minute, more unprepared I made a mistake in my life today
Everything I love gets lost in the drawers
I want to start over, I want to be winning
Way out of sync from the beginning I wanna hurry home to you
Put on a slow, dumb show for you and crack you up
So you can put a blue ribbon on my brain
God, I'm very, very frightened, I?ll overdo it Looking for somewhere to stand and stay
I leaned on the wall and the wall leaned away
Can I get a minute of not being nervous
And not thinking of my dick? My leg is sparkles, my leg is pins
I better get my shit together, better gather my shit in
You could drive a car through my head in five minutes
From one side of it to the other I wanna hurry home to you
Put on a slow, dumb show for you and crack you up
So you can put a blue ribbon on my brain
God, I'm very, very frightened, I?ll overdo it You know I dreamed about you
For twenty-nine years before I saw you
You know I dreamed about you
I missed you for, for twenty-nine years You know I dreamed about you
For twenty-nine years before I saw you
You know I dreamed about you
I missed you for, for twenty-nine years Exile. It takes your mind...again.
Exile. It takes your mind...again. You got sucker's luck...
Have you given up?
Does it feel like a trial?
Does it trouble your mind the way, you trouble mine. Exile. It takes your mind...again.
Exile. It takes your mind...again. Oh, you meant so much...
Have you given up?
Does it feel like a trial?
Does it trouble your mind the way, you trouble mine.
Does it feel like a trial?
Now, you're thinkin' too fast you're like, marbles on glass. Vilify. Don't even try.
Vilify. Don't even try. You got sucker's luck...
Have you given up?
Does it feel like a trial?
Does it trouble your mind the way you trouble mine.
Does it feel like a trial?
Did you fall far for the same empty answers again? Vilify. Don't even try.
Vilify. Don't even try. Vilify. Don't even try.
Vilify. Don't even try. Vilify. Can someone send a runner
Through the weather that I'm under
For the feeling I lost today? Can someone send a runner
For the feeling that I lost today? Can someone send a runner
Through the weather that I'm under
For the feeling I lost today? Can someone send a runner
For the feeling I lost today? You must be somewhere in London
You must be lovin' your life in the rain
You must be somewhere in London
Walking Abbey Lane I don't even think to make
I don't even think to make
I don't even think to make corrections Famous angels never come through England
England gets the ones you never need
I'm in a Los Angeles Cathedral
Minor singin' airheads sing for me Put an ocean and a river between everybody else
Between everything, yourself and home
Put and ocean and a river
Between everything, yourself and home You must be somewhere in London
You must be lovin' your life in the rain
You must be somewhere in London
Walking Abbey Lane I don't even think to make
I don't even think to make
I don't even think to make corrections Famous angels never come through England
England gets the ones you never need
I'm in a Los Angeles Cathedral
Minor singin' airheads sing for me Afraid of the house, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the house, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the house, 'cause they're desperate to entertain Afraid of the house, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the house, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the house, 'cause they're desperate to entertain Afraid of the house, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the house, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the house, 'cause they're desperate to entertain Pull out breaks behind the houses
I don't see what's strange about this
Tiny bubbles hang above me
It's a sign that someone loves me
I can hardly stand upright
Hit my head up on the light
I have faith but don't believe you
This love ain't enough to leave you Everything I love is on the table
Everything I love is out to sea I have only two emotions
Careful fear and dead devotion
I can't get the balance right
Throw my marbles in the fight
I see all the ones I wept for
All the things I had it in for
I won't cry until I hear
'Cause I was not supposed to be here Everything I love is on the table
Everything I love is out to sea
I'm not alone
I'll never be
Into the bone
I'll never grieve I'm tired, I'm freezing, I'm dumb
When it gets so late I forget everyone
I need somewhere to stay
Don't think anybody I know is awake
Calm down, it's alright
Keep my arms the rest of the night
When they ask what do I see
I see a bright white beautiful heaven hangin' over me I'm not alone
I'll never be
Into the bone
I'll never grieve
And if you want, (too seriously)
To see me cry. (don't swallow the cap)
Play Let It Be (pat yourself on the back)
Or Nevermind, (too seriously) There's a time to leave, there's a time to think about
What I wanna say to the girls at the door
I need somewhere to be
But I can't get around the river in front of me
Come down, it's alright
Lead my arms the rest of the night
When they ask what do I see
I see a bright white beautiful heaven hangin' over me I'm not alone, (too seriously)
I'll never be, (don't swallow the cap)
Into the bone, (pat yourself on the back)
I'll never grieve (too seriously)
And if you want, (too seriously)
To see me cry, (don't swallow the cap)
Play Let It Be, (pat yourself on the back)
Or Nevermind, (too seriously) Graceless
Is there a powder to erase this?
Is it dissolvable and tasteless?
You can't imagine how I hate this
Graceless I'm trying, but I'm graceless
Don't have the sunny side to face this
I am invisible and weightless
You can't imagine how I hate this
Graceless I'm trying, but I've gone
Through the glass again
Just come and find me
God loves everybody, don't remind me
I took the medicine when I went missing
Just let me hear your voice, just let me listen Graceless
I figured out how to be faithless
But it will be a sheme to waste this
You can't imagine how I hate this
Graceless I'm trying, but I've gone
Through the glass again
Just come and find me
God loves everybody, don't remind me
I took the medicine and I went missing
Just let me hear your voice, just let me listen All of my thoughts of you
Bullets through rotten fruit
Come apart at the seams
Now I know what dying means I am not my rosy self
Left my roses on my shelf
Take the wild ones, they're my favorites
It's the side effects that save us Grace
Put the flowers you find in a vase
If you're dead in the mind it will brighten the place
Don't let them die on the vine, it's a waste
Grace There's a science to walking through windows
There's a science to walking through windows
There's a science to walking through windows
There's a science to walking through windows without you All of my thoughts of you
Bullets through rotten fruit
Come apart at the seams
Now I know what dying means I am not my rosy self
Left my roses on my shelf
Take the wild ones, they're my favorites
It's the side effects that save us Grace
Put the flowers you find in a vase
If you're dead in the mind it will brighten the base
Don't let them die on the vine, it's a waste
Grace Grace
Put the flowers you find in a vase
If you're dead in the mind it will brighten the base
Don't let them die on the vine, it's a waste
Grace Don't make me read your mind
You should know me better than that
It takes me too much time
You should know me better than that
You're not that much like me
You should know me better than that
We have different enemies
You should know me better than that I should leave it alone but you're not right
I should leave it alone but you're not right Can't you write it on the wall?
You should know me better than that
There's no room to write it all
You should know me better than that
Can you turn the TV down?
You should know me better than that
There's too much crying in the sound
I should know you better than that I should leave it alone but you're not right
I should leave it alone but you're not right
I should live in salt for leaving you behind
Behind Think about something so much
You should know me better than that
Start to slide out of touch
You should know me better than that
Tell yourself it's all you know
You should know me better than that
Learn to appreciate the void
You should know me better than that I should live in salt for leaving you behind
Behind
I should live in salt for leaving you behind
Behind
I should live in salt for leaving you behind
Behind I don't worry anymore, nothing like I did before
I don't worry, I just watch them rolling back
I don't worry anymore 'Cause it's alright, alright to see a ghost
And I wanna see 'em go down in the river where they go
And I wanna see 'em rolling, rolling back
And I wanna see 'em go 'cause it's alright, alright to see a ghost I'm gonna run to the river, kiss my hand and wave
Gonna run to the river, gonna throw a blue bouquet
'Cause they're gonna be cool, happy, genius heroes
I'm gonna miss 'em so much I will settle in and dream of a slow and funny scene
I will settle in and watch 'em rolling by
I will settle in and dream 'Cause it's alright, alright to see a ghost
And I wanna see 'em go down in the river where they go
And I wanna see 'em rolling, rolling by I'm gonna run to the river, kiss my hand and wave
Gonna run to the river, gonna throw a blue bouquet
'Cause they're gonna be cool, happy, genius heroes
I'm gonna miss them so much I'm gonna run to the river, kiss my hand and wave
Gonna run to the river, gonna send 'em on their way
'Cause they're gonna be cool, happy, genius heroes
I'm gonna miss them so much
Yeah, they're gonna be cool, happy, genius heroes
I'm gonna miss 'em so much You have to do it running
But you do everything that they ask you to
'Cause you don't mind seeing yourself in a picture
As long as you look faraway, as long as you look removed Showered and blue-blazered, fill yourself with quarters
Showered and blue-blazered, fill yourself with quarters You get mistaken for strangers by your own friends
When you pass them at night
Under the silvery, silvery Citibank lights
Arm in arm in arm and eyes and eyes, glazing under Oh, you wouldn't want an angel watching over
Surprise, surprise, they wouldn't wanna watch
Another un-innocent, elegant fall
Into the un-magnificent lives of adults Make up something to believe in your heart of hearts
So you have something to wear on your sleeve of sleeves
So you swear, you just saw a feathery woman
Carry a blindfolded man through the trees Showered and blue-blazered, fill yourself with quarters
Showered and blue-blazered, fill yourself with quarters You get mistaken for strangers by your own friends
When you pass them at night
Under the silvery, silvery Citibank lights
Arm in arm in arm and eyes and eyes, glazing under Oh, you wouldn't want an angel watching over
Surprise, surprise, they wouldn't wanna watch
Another un-innocent, elegant fall
Into the un-magnificent lives of adults You get mistaken for strangers by your own friends
When you pass them at night
Under the silvery, silvery Citibank lights
Arm in arm in arm and eyes and eyes, glazing under Oh, you wouldn't want an angel watching over
Surprise, surprise, they wouldn't wanna watch
Another un-innocent, elegant fall
Into the un-magnificent lives of adults You keep my secrets
And I keep none
Wish I could go back
And keep some It's fireproof
Nothing breaks your heart
It's fireproof
It's just the way you are You tell me you're waiting
To find someone
Who isn't so hopeless
But there's no one You're fireproof
Nothing breaks your heart
You're fireproof
How'd you get so far You're the needle in the hay
The water at the door
You're a million miles away
Doesn't matter anymore Jennifer you are not the only reason
My head is boiling and my hands are freezing
Jennifer you are not the only one
That sit awake until the wild feelings leave Nothing breaks your heart
It's fireproof
It's just the way you are
You're fireproof That's what you always say
You're fireproof
I wish was that way And who are you, the proud lord said,
That i must bow so low?
Only a cat of a different coat,
Thats all the truth i know. In a coat of gold or a coat of red,
A lion still has claws,
And mine are long and sharp, my lord,
As long and sharp as yours. And so he spoke, and so he spoke,
That lord of Castamere,
But now the rains weep oer his hall,
With no one there to hear. Yes now the rains weep oer his hall,
And not a soul to hear. Every time, you get a drink
And every time, you go to sleep
Are those dreams inside your head
Is there sunlight on your bed And every time, you're drivin' home
Way outside your safety zone
Wherever you will ever be
You're never getting rid of me You own me
There's nothing you can do
You own me You could've made a safer bet
But what you break is what you get
You wake up in the bed, you make
I think you made a big mistake You own me
There's nothing you can do
You own me You own me
Lucky you You own me
There's nothing you can do You clean yourself to meet
The man who isn't me
You're puttin' on a shirt
A shirt I'll never see The letter's in your coat
But no one's in your head
'Cause you're too smart to remember
You're too smart Lucky you
Lucky you
Lucky you Stand up straight at the foot of your love
I lift my shirt up
Stand up straight at the foot of your love
I lift my shirt up I was carried to Ohio in a swarm of bees
I'll never marry but Ohio don't remember me Lay my head on the hood of your car
I'll take it too far
Lay my head on the hood of your car
I'll take it too far I still owe money to the money to the money I owe
I never thought about love when I thought about home
I still owe money to the money to the money I owe
The floors are falling out from everybody I know I'm on a bloodbuzz
Yes I am

I'm on a bloodbuzz
God I am
I'm on a blood, buzz I was carried to Ohio in a swarm of bees
I never married but Ohio don't remember me I still owe money to the money to the money I owe

God I am

How am I supposed to know?
When you go under the waste
What am I supposed to say? I see people on the floor
They're slidin' to the sea
Can't stay here anymore
We're turning into thieves If I stay here trouble will find me
If I stay here I'll never leave
If I stay here trouble will find me
I believe Jo I'll always think of you
As the kind of child who knew
This was never gonna last
Oh Jo you fell so fast Hey Jo sorry I hurt you, but they say love is a virtue don't they?
Hey Jo sorry I hurt you, but they say love is a virtue don't they?
Hey Jo sorry I hurt you, but they say love is a virtue don't they?
Hey Jo sorry I hurt you, but they say love is a virtue don't they? I see people on the floor
They're slidin' to the sea

Alone with the flu
Find out from friends
That wasn't true
Go out at night with your headphones on, again
And walk through the Manhattan valleys of, the dead Didn't want to be your ghost
Didn't want to be anyone's ghost
Didn't want to be your ghost
Didn't want to be anyone's ghost
But I don't want anybody else
I don't want anybody else You said I came close
As anyone has come
To live underwater
For more than a month
You said it was not inside my heart, it was
You said it should tear a kid apart, it does Didn't want to be your ghost
Didn't want to be anyone's ghost
Didn't want to be your ghost
Didn't want to be anyone's ghost
But I don't want anybody else
I don't want anybody else

I don't want anybody else I had a hole in the middle where the lightning went through it
Told my friends not to worry
I had a hole in the middle someone's sideshow to do
I told my friends not to worry Didn't want to be your ghost
Didn't want to be anyone's ghost
Didn't want to be your ghost
Didn't want to be anyone's ghost I've been draggin' around
From the end of your coat for two weeks, ahh
Everywhere you go is swirlin'
Everything you say has water under it, ahh You know, I keep your fingerprints
In a pink folder in the middle of my table
You're the tall kingdom I surround
Think I'd better follow you around You might need me more
Than you think you will
Come home in the car you love
Brainy, brainy, brainy I've been draggin' around
From the end of your coat for two weeks, ahh
You keep changing your fancy, fancy mind
Every time I decide to let go I was up all night again
Boning up and reading the American Dictionary
You'll never believe me, what I found
Think I'd better follow you around You might need me more
Than you think you will
Come home in the car you love
Brainy, brainy, brainy You might need me more
Than you think you will
Come home in the car you love
Brainy, brainy, brainy I got two armfuls of magazines for you, I'll bring 'em over
So hang your holiday rainbow lights in the garden
Hang your holiday rainbow lights in the garden
And I'll, I'll bring a nice icy drink to you Let me come over, I can waste your time, I'm bored
Invite me to the war, every night of the summer
And we'll play G.I. blood, G.I. blood
We'll stand by the pool, we'll throw out our golden arms Darlin', can you tie my string?
Killers are callin' on me

I think they're onto me
Didn't anybody, didn't anybody tell you
Didn't anybody tell you how to gracefully disappear in a room
I know you put in the hours to keep me in sunglasses, I know And so and now I'm sorry I missed you
I had a secret meeting in the basement of my brain
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
And now I'm sorry I missed you
I had a secret meeting in the basement of my brain I think this place is full of spies
I think I'm ruined
Didn't anybody, didn't anybody tell you
Didn't anybody tell you, this river's full of lost sharks
I know you put in the hours to keep me in sunglasses, I know And so and now I'm sorry I missed you
I had a secret meeting in the basement of my brain
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way Leave your home
Change your name
Live alone
Eat your cake Vanderlyle, crybaby, cry
Though the waters are risin'
Still no surprisin' you
Vanderlyle, crybaby, cry
Man its all been forgiven
Swans are a swimmin'
I'll explain everything to the geeks All the very best of us
String ourselves up for love
All the very best of us

String ourselves up for love Vanderlyle, crybaby, cry
Though the waters are risin'

Vanderlyle, crybaby, cry
Man its all been forgiven
Swans are a swimmin'
I'll explain everything to the geeks I'll explain everything to the geeks
I'll explain everything to the geeks When I think of you in the city
The sight of you among the sites
I get this sudden sinking feeling
Of a man about to fly
Never kept me up before
Now I've been awake for days
I can't fight it anymore
I'm going through an awkward phase
I am secretly in love with
Everyone that I grew up with
Do my crying underwater
I can't get down any farther
All my drowning friends can see
Now there is no running from it
It's become the crux of me
I wish that I could rise above it But I stay down
With my demons
I stay down
With my demons Passing buzzards in the sky
Alligators in the sewers
I don't even wonder why
Hide among the under views
Huddle with them all night long
The worried talk to god goes on
I sincerely tried to love it
Wish that I could rise above it But I stay down
With my demons
I stay down
With my demons
I stay down
With my demons
I stay down
With my demons Can I stay here? I can sleep
On the floor
Paint the blood and hang the palms
On the door
Do not think I'm going places anymore
Wanna see the sun come up above New York
Oh, everyday I start so great
Then the sunlight dims
Less I've learned
The more I see the pythons and the limbs
Do not know what's wrong with me
Sours in the cup
When I walk into a room
I do not light it up
Fuck So I stay down
With my demons
I stay down
With my demons
I stay down
With my demons
I stay down
With my demons Ada, don't talk about reasons
Why you don't want to talk about reasons
Why you don't wanna talk
Now that you got everybody you consider sharp
All alone, all together, all together in the dark Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air Ada, put the sounds of your house in a song
Try to be speechless for a minute
If you think you're gonna faint, go out in the hallway
Let them all have your neck Ada, don't stay in the lake too long
It lives alone and it barely knows you
It'll have a nervous breakdown and fall
Into a thousand pieces around you Stand inside an empty Tuxedo
With grapes in my mouth, waiting for Ada
Ada, hold onto yourself by the sleeves
I think everything counts a little more than we think Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air, yeah Ada, Ada, Ada
Ada, I can hear the sound of your laugh through the wall Ada, don't talk about reasons
Why you don't want to talk about reasons
Why you don't wanna talk
Now that you got everybody you consider sharp
All alone, all together, all together in the dark Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air Ada, Ada, Ada
Ada, I can hear the sound of your laugh through the wall
Ada, Ada, Ada
Ada, I've been hoping you know your way around Falling out of touch with all
My friends are somewhere, getting wasted
Hope they're staying glued together
I have arms for them Take another sip of them
It floats around and takes me over
Like a little drop of ink
In a glass of water Get inside their clothes with my green gloves
Watch their videos in their chairs
Get inside their beds with my green gloves
Get inside their heads, love their loves Cinderella through the room
I glide and swan
'Cause I'm the best slow dancer
In the universe Falling out of touch with all
My friends are somewhere, getting wasted
Hope they're staying glued together
I have arms for them Get inside their clothes with my green gloves
Watch their videos in their chairs
Get inside their beds with my green gloves
Get inside their heads, love their loves Now I hardly know them
And I'll take my time
I'll carry them over
And I'll make them mine Get inside their clothes with my green gloves
Watch their videos in their chairs
Get inside their beds with my green gloves
Get inside their heads, love their loves Give my jewels to the army, my silverware and jeans
Give my love to your family, tell them anything
Give yourself to anyone, give yourself away
Don't be a nightingale for anyone's space to fill If I could, I'd be your star again
Fall across your falling sky It takes a lot of little rain to make you feel like nothing
Anything, anything you can do, do to me
For everything I did for you nothing
I didn't try to take your love away
I just never knew I had it There is nothing you can say to ever make me want you
American
There is nothing you can say to ever make me leave you
American
American Mary If you kiss me, kiss me with your silver eyes
Don't look at me like someone you don't recognize
I didn't try to do this
Your arms around my shoulder blades are useless There is nothing you can say to ever make me want you
American
There is nothing you can say to ever make me leave you
American
American Mary I was in a fog, I didn't notice everything
Was coming all apart inside of me
There wasn't anyway for anyone to settle in
You made a slow disaster out of me
There's a radiant darkness upon us
I don't want you to worry
I was careful but nothing is harmless
Baby, you better hurry You were a kindness when I was a stranger
But I wouldn't ask for what I didn't need
Everything's weird and we're always in danger
Why would you shatter somebody like me? It doesn't work that way
Wanting not to want you won't make it so
It doesn't work that way
Don't leave me here alone I'll do what I can to be a confident wreck
Can't feel this way forever, I mean
There wasn't any way for anyone to settle in
You made a slow disaster out of me
There's a radiant darkness upon us
But I don't want you to worry
I was careful but nothing is harmless
Baby, you better hurry You were a kindness when I was a stranger
But I wouldn't ask for what didn't need
everythings weird and we're always in danger
why would you shatter somebody like It doesn't work that way
Wanting not to want you doesn't make it so
It doesn't work that way
Don't leave me here alone
It doesn't work that way
Wanting not to want you doesn't make it so
It doesn't work that way
Don't leave me here alone Ten years older than I was
When I brought you down to see
What I thought would make you fall in love
Where an old canal would dream
"Someday, man, I'm gonna be no different than the other rivers."
I tried to look at you but I couldn't break the ice
We stood out there for an hour and were freezing
You put your hand around my back
I guess you thought I needed that I never try to find you
I hope you don't remember me
But I hope you're not alone You wanted me to take you home
You said you'd rather be alone
I never thought of that
The car was warm and we had wine
But I couldn't find the perfect song
Now I own furniture, a 401, and crow's feet
And I can't even remember the car
Sometimes I can feel your weight when I close my eyes
Seven times I was under you I never try to find you
I hope you don't remember me
But I hope you're not alone
And I don't wanna know what you're thinking
I'm looking out the window
Just drinking and drinking and drinking Shallow frame and shaky sticks but I know there's a river in me
Shallow-minded adult tricks but I know there's a river in me I never try to find you
I hope you don't remember me
But I hope you're not alone
And I don't wanna know what you're thinking
I'm looking out the window
Just sitting there
Sitting down and fucking drinking no nobody wants to be
no no one's lover
no matter what they say
lovers know they are the ones
who one day have to go trophy wives
I know they wander
and find a young young man
trophy wives
I know they wander one time you were a good rabbit
to all the girls
and all their lovely mothers
you tried a piece of everything
now nothing turns you on trophy wives
I know they wander
and find a young young man
trophy wives
I know they wander run run baby I don't feel alive
but I'm pretty and I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna be alright to drive
to new jack city for a younger man
with a better brain I fell in love with you
no matter what you say
but you were right about the reasons
I don't want to be
what I'm becoming your trophy wife
I know they wander
and find a young young man
you trophy wife
I know they wander
and find a young man
your trophy wife
I know they wander Little faith, follow me
I set a fire in a blackberry field
Make us laugh, or nothing will
I set a fire just to see what it kills Now I'm stuck in New York
And the rain's coming down
I don't feel like we'll go anywhere
Stuck in New York
And the rain's coming down
Still in line for the vanity fair Leave our excellent souls
Head for the coast
Leave our excellent souls
Everything goes All our lonely kicks are getting harder to find
We'll play nuns versus priests until somebody cries
All our lonely kicks that make us saintly and thin
We'll play nuns versus priests until somebody wins Awesome prince, get your sleep
Lose your heart in history
Make us laugh or nothing will
I set a fire just to see what it kills Don't be bitter, Anna
I know how you think
You're waiting for Radio City to sink
You'll find commiseration in everyone's eyes
The storm will suck the pretty girls into the sky All our lonely kicks are getting harder to find
We'll play nuns versus priests until somebody cries
All our lonely kicks that make us saintly and thin
We'll play nuns versus priests until somebody wins Leave our excellent souls
Head for the coast
Leave our excellent souls
Everything goes I can see the glowing lights
I can see them every night
Really not that far away
I could be there in a day I wonder if you live there still
I kinda think you always will
If I tried you'd probably be
Hard to find What I feel now about you then
I'm just glad I can explain
You're beautiful and close and young
In those ways we were the same There's a lot I've not forgotten
I let go of other things
If I tried they'd probably be
Hard to find They can all
Just kiss off into the air
They can all
Just kiss off into the air I don't know why we had to lose
The ones who took so little space
They're still waiting for the east
To cover what we can't erase I'm not holding out for you
I'm still watching for the signs
If I tried you'd probably be
Hard to find They can all
Just kiss off into the air
They can all
Just kiss off into the air This is nothing like it was in my room
In my best clothes
Trying to think of you
This is nothing like it was in my room
In my best clothes The English are waiting
And I don't know what to do
In my best clothes
This is when I need you The English are waiting
And I don't know what to do
In my best clothes I'm the new blue blood, I'm the great white hope
I'm the new blue blood I won't fuck us over, I'm Mr. November
I'm Mr. November, I won't fuck us over
[repeat] I wish that I believed in fate
I wish I didn't sleep so late
I used to be carried in the arms of cheerleaders
[repeat] I'm the new blue blood, I'm the great white hope
I'm the new blue blood I won't fuck us over, I'm Mr. November
I'm Mr. November, I won't fuck us over
[repeat] I wish that I believed in fate
I wish I didn't sleep so late
I used to be carried in the arms of cheerleaders
[repeat] I'm the new blue blood, I'm the great white hope
I'm the new blue blood
I won't fuck us over, I'm Mr. November
I'm Mr. November, I won't fuck us over I have your good clothes in the car
So cut your hair so no one knows
I have your dreams and your teeth marks
And all my fingernails are painted I'm here to take you now You were right about the end
It didn't make a difference
Everything I can remember
I remember wrong How can anybody know
How they got to be this way
You must have known I'd do this someday
Break my arms around the one I love
And be forgiven by the time my lover comes
Break my arms around my love Break my arms around the one I love
And be forgiven by the time my lover comes
Break my arms around my love I don't have any questions
I don't think it's gonna rain
You were right about the end
It didn't make a difference I'm here to take you now Out among the missing sons and daughters of the SoHo riots
Out among the missing sons and daughters of the SoHo riots I'm here to take you now How can anybody know
how they got to be this way
You must have known I'd do this someday

And be forgiven by the time my lover comes

When I fell off the chair and cracked open my head
Bees flew out and they flew up their skirts

Give me a reason to get out of the city
See you inside watching swarms on TV
Livin' or dyin' in New York it means nothing to me
I gave my heart to the Army
The only sentimental thing I could think of
With cousins and colors and somewhere overseas
But it'll take a better war to kill a college man like me I'm too tired to drive anyway, anyway right now
Do you care if I stayed?
You can put on your bathing suits
And I'll try to find somethin' on this thing that means nothin' enough
Losin' my breath, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Losin' my breath, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo This pricey stuff makes me dizzy
I guess I've always been a delicate man
Takes me a day to remember a day
I didn't mean to let it get so far out of hand
I was a comfortable kid
But I don't think about it much anymore
Lay me on the table, put flowers in my mouth
And we can say that we invented a summer lovin' torture party I'm too tired to drive anyway, anyway right now
Do you care if I stayed?
You can put on your bathing suits
And I'll try to find something on this thing that means nothin' enough You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo Losin' my breath
Doo doo doo doo doo doo Tina lies on the ground
She lies there forever
She likes the sun
Tina knows the devil Tina loves the violence
Of living in the country
She likes that it's so far from me Tina has her story down
I really thought I knew it
And it changed around
When I was almost through it Sunshine on my back is
The only kind I like
Sunshine in my brain is
Sunshine in my brain is the lonely kind of pain
It's the sunshine of a lonely mind (?) She says "After today there is nothing (?) you owe me"
And I'm so glad that you came, I needed someone who loves me
But just don't try to talk yourself into this love
And sleep like a baby while I'm staying home
It's as much what you say, as it is what you do
You can't try to stay you either will or you won't Sunshine on my back is
The only kind I like
Sunshine in my brain is
Sunshine in my brain is the lonely kind of pain
It's the sunshine of a lonely mind (?) Where crybabies cry
In the united states
Bright white on both sides
Like a plate
Nobody listens
Nobody should
It'd be a waste of attention Not enough money
To buy a PC
So I come in this weekend
Asleep on my feet
And if I forget you
Ill have nobody left to forget
I guess thats what assholes get Traded my day light
For a career But I need you to disprove
My theory of the crows Pouring my fingers across the keys
Will someone review my salary please?
Im selling my time to the man who sells style
That time should be mine to waste on you Ill suck off investors
Ill suck off VCs Im losing my posture from time on my knees
They treat me so well
Cause I'll do anything
Its in my nature of service But ill need you to disprove
My theory of the crows Kids of the wealthy are raised by the poor
You send daughters to los angelos and new york
I need mine to see me
When I wake up
I need mine to know
That im what they come to When they come home Underline everything
I'm a professional in my beloved white shirt
Underline everything
I'm a professional in my beloved white shirt I'm going down among the saints Raise our heavenly glasses to the heavens
Squalor Victoria
Squalor Victoria
Raise our heavenly glasses to the heavens
Squalor Victoria
Squalor Victoria Out of my league, I have birds in my sleeves
And I wanna rush in with the fools
Out of my league, I have birds in my sleeves
And I wanna rush in with the fools Raise our heavenly glasses to the heavens
Squalor Victoria
Squalor Victoria
Raise our heavenly glasses to the heavens
Squalor Victoria
Squalor Victoria I'm going down among the saints 3:30 in the last night for you to save this
You're zoning out, zoning out, zoning out, zoning out
3:30 in the last night for you to save this
You're zoning out, zoning out, zoning out, zoning out This isn't working, you, my middlebrow fuck up I survived the dinner
And the air went thinner
I retired to the briars by the pool
It gets so loud If I die this instant
Taken from a distance
They would probably list it down
Among other things 'round town Got my rings around me
I got baby to pound me
I see stars and go weak
My baby cries and lays me down In the skies over black Venice
I see eyes of a white menace
The surprise of the week
Is that I never heard the sound All the L.A. women
Fall asleep while swimmin'
I got paid to fish 'em out
And then one day I lost the job And I cried a little
I got fried a little
Then she laid her eyes on mine
And she said, "Babe, you're better off" I got my rings around me
I got baby to pound me
I see stars and go weak
My baby cries and lays me down In the skies over black Venice
I see eyes of a white menace
The surprise of the week
Is that I never heard the sound Tunnel vision lights my way
Lead a little life today As the free-fall advances
I'm the moron who dances
Ah
I was teething on roses
I was in guns and noses
Ah Under the withering white skies of humiliation
Under the withering white skies of humiliation Tunnel vision lights my way
Lead a little life today
Tunnel vision lights my way
Lead a little life today She wore blue velvet
Said she can't help it
She wore blue velvet
Said she can't help it
She wore blue velvet
Said she can't help it I think I saw you riding in a car,
You looked happy for a woman
Black fingers in your mouth and a white,
And a white pearl choker. My head plays it over and over,
Don't interrupt me.
I think I saw you reaching for a glass,
With your lanky white arms,
Nothing else moves that way, are you kidding me?
My head plays it over and over,
Don't interrupt me. All dolled-up in straps, all colored in
Now, love, where have you been?
Dolled-up in straps, all colored in
Now, love, where have you been?
Where have you been? I think I saw you walking in the city,
Hips like boy's,
The sun fell behind you and never stood up.
My head plays it over and over.
I think I heard you singing,
'Oh poor sky, don't cry on me
Did somebody break your heart again?
Oh poor sky, don't cry on me
Are you gonna fall apart again?'
My head plays it over and over. All dolled-up in straps, all colored in
Now, love, where have you been?
Dolled-up in straps, all colored in
Now, love, where have you been?
Where have you been? Oh poor sky, don't cry on me
Did somebody break your heart again?
Oh poor sky, don't cry on me
Did somebody break your heart again?
Oh poor sky, don't cry on me
Are you gonna fall apart again?
Oh poor sky, don't cry on me
Are you gonna fall apart again? Bottle eyes, glassy blue
I watch the rain come out of you
Sky is white with the flu, I'm terrified of losing you
If I go to the sea, I'll bring you down, down with me
If I go to the rain, you'll never see me again You've got cold girl fever I promised to leave if you ever went cold
Then leave when I'm sleeping, you told me
Put your spine in your back and your arms in your coat
Don't hold on to me when there's nothing to hold You've got cold girl fever It's not what you said but that's what you meant
I'm losing my baby on promises kept
What are you for?
What are you for now that I have hard cold? You've got cold girl fever We look younger than we feel
And older than we are
Now nobody's funny
No God, they took our fashion week
That's a real bad thing
'Cause we have scars to cover Now I forget how to think
So crack my skull
Rearrange me Lover put me in your beautiful bed
And cover me
Lover put me in your beautiful bed Nothing made a sound in Williamstown that night
And all the air was empty
Then what to my wondering eyes should appear
Nothing, cause nothing ever happens here Now I forget how to think
So crack my skull
Rearrange me Lover put me in your beautiful bed
And cover me
Lover put me in your beautiful bed Nothing ever happened here
Nothing ever happened here
Bad things never happen to the beautiful I could walk out, but I won't
In my mind I am in your arms
I wish someone would take my place
Can't face heaven all heavenfaced
No one's careful all the time
If you lose me, I'm gonna die How completely high was I
I was off by a thousand miles
Hit the ceiling, then you fall
Things are tougher than we are
I could walk out, but I won't
In my mind I am in your arms
I wish someone would take my place
Can't face heaven all heavenfaced Let's go wait out in the fields with the ones we love
Let's go wait out in the fields with the ones we love
Let's go wait out in the fields with the ones we love
Let's go wait out in the fields with the ones we love She's a griever, my believer
It's not a fever, it's a freezer
I believe her, I`m a griever now
She's a griever, my believer
It's not a fever, it's a freezer
I believe her, I`m a griever now I'm put together beautifully
Big wet bottle in my fist, big wet rose in my teeth
I'm perfect piece of ass
Like every Californian
So tall I take over the street, with high beams shining on my back
A wingspan unbelievable
I'm a festival, I'm a parade And all the wine is all for me
And all the wine is all for me
And all the wine is all for me I'm a birthday candle in a circle of black girls
God is on my side
'Cause I'm the child bride
I'm so sorry but the motorcade will have to go around me this time
'Cause God is on my side
And I'm the child bride And all the wine is all for me
And all the wine is all for me
And all the wine is all for me I carry the dollhouse, safe on my shoulders
Through the black city, night lights are on in the corners
And everyone's sleeping upstairs
All safe and sound
All safe and sound, I won't the let psychos around
All safe and sound, I won't let the psychos around I'm in a state, I'm in a state
Nothing can touch us my love
I'm in a state, I'm in a state
Nothing can touch us my love You stand now, on yourself
A little moon is coming in the room
You stand there still
Like you were in the arms of
Everyone you ever wanted I was watching you well I won't stop you, I won't speak
The water on your cheek is the only thing smooth and
I'm ashamed that I'm ashamed of you
Standing in my room, lest more water overtake you And I was watching you, watching you well Why won't you leave me quicker?
Why won't you leave me? I'm ashamed that I'm ashamed of you
For standing in my room, lest more water overtake you I won't stop you
And I won't speak Why won't you leave me quicker?
Why won't you leave me? Could you tell the enchantment I said goodbye
I met a girl called disillusionment
Could you tell her I made the headlines
This boy drawed wings on everything Could you tell her to check the headlines
This boy burns angels in the river
You know I dreamed about you
For 29 years before
I saw you You know I dreamed about you
I missed you for 29 years
Bird that flys out of order
Underneath the sky I run up to the rainbow, girl
Just to pass it by
I'll never have a change of heart
I swore I'd never sing I have no heart this one is gone
And now I wear the wings
You know I dreamed about you
For 29 years before
I saw you You know I dreamed about you
I missed you for 29 years
You know I dreamed about you
For 29 years before
I saw you You know I dreamed about you
I missed you for 29 years
You know I dreamed about you
For 29 years before

[repeat] You're cussing a storm in a cocktail dress your mother wore when she was young
Red sun saint around your neck
A wet martini in a paper cup
You're a wasp nest, you're a wasp nest. Your eyes are broken bottles
And I'm afraid to ask
And all your wrath and cutting beauty
You're poison in the pretty glass
You're a wasp nest, you're a wasp nest You're all humming live wires under your killing clothes.
Get over here, I wanna kiss your skinny throat
You're a wasp nest, you're a wasp nest I'm in the city you hated

Counting the clicks with the living dead
My eyes are red I'm in the crush and I hate it
My eyes are fallen

But I will not spill my guts out I don't need any help to be breakable, believe me
I know nobody else who can laugh along to any kind of joke
I won't need any help to be lonely when you leave me It'll be easy to cover
Gather my skeletons far inside
It'll be summer in Dallas
Before I realize I don't want you to grieve
But I want you to sympathize (alright)
I can't blame you for losing
Your mind for a little while (so did I)
I don't want you to change
But I want you to recognize (that I) It'll be easy to cover
Gather your skeletons far inside
It'll be summer in Dallas
Before you realize That I'll never be

I wanted to ask you, if you could stay
But you were on something, with your friends around
There was nothing I could say But I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me The next time I saw you, you were breaking down
Other than that, you were the same
You looked right at me and I just turned around
There was still nothing I could say But I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me
I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me I have dreams of anonymous castrati

The air is thin around your beautiful head
You're saying things with your mouth to me
That I don't recognize, you're aware of yourself lately Redefining yourself, designing yourself
You haven't looked at me forever
Got a diagram of your associations
A strategy, you're weighing your options What would you trade me for?
You're measuring me lately
And I can tell and I can tell I'm losing weight
You're measuring me lately, you're dressing me Do not tell me I've changed
You're just raising your standards
Do not give me away
I am the same, I am the same Have you found him?
Have you told him everything?
Does he say he feels bad about all this?
You've shown tenderness for me
Tenderness for me, to him Do not tell me I've changed
You're just raising your standards
Do not give me away
I am the same, I am the same You're pink, you're young, you're middle-class
They say it doesn't matter
Fifteen blue shirts and womanly hands
You're shooting up the ladder Your mind is racing like a pro now
Oh my God, it doesn't mean a lot to you
One time, you were a glowing young ruffian
Oh my God, it was a million years ago Sometimes you get up and bake a cake or something
Sometimes you stay in bed
Sometimes you go, la, di, da, di, da, di, da, da
Till your eyes roll back into your head Your mind is racing like a pro now
Oh my God, it doesn't mean a lot to you
One time, you were a glowing young ruffian
Oh my God, it was a million years ago you're dumbstruck, baby
You're dumbstruck, baby, now you know
You're dumbstruck, baby
You're dumbstruck, baby, now you know Your mind is racing like a pro now
Oh my God, it doesn't mean a lot to you
One time, you were a glowing young ruffian
Oh my God, it was a million years ago you're dumbstruck, baby
You're dumbstruck, baby, now you know
You're dumbstruck, baby
You're dumbstruck, baby, now you know
You're dumbstruck, baby All night I lay on my pillow and pray
For my boss to stop me in the hallway
Lay my head on his shoulder and say
Son, I've been hearing good things I wake up without warning and go flying around the house
In my sauvignon fierce, freaking out
Take a forty-five minute shower and kiss the mirror
And say, look at me
Baby, we'll be fine
All we gotta do is be brave and be kind I put on an argyle sweater and put on a smile
I don't know how to do this
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything Baby, come over, I need entertaining
I had a stilted, pretending day
Lay me down and say something pretty
Lay me back down where I wanted to stay
Just say something perfect, something I can steal
Say, look at me
Baby, we'll be fine
All we've gotta do is be brave and be kind All night I lay on my pillow and pray
For my boss to stop me in the hallway
Lay my head on his shoulder and say
Son, I've been hearing good things I wake up without warning and go flying around the house
In my sauvignon fierce, freaking out
Take a forty-five minute shower and kiss the mirror
And say, look at me
Baby, we'll be fine

Say, look at me
Baby, we'll be fine
All we've gotta do is be brave and be kind You had fun, but you couldn't get him out of the car
I guess mamma's boys only go so far
You went in and put a record on
To make it sound like someone was home
And thanked yourself for pouring yourself a drink Try to figure out and laugh yourself to the showers
Burn yourself alive and join the monster squad
They say in this place you can reinvent yourself Well you've done it again, Virginia
Made another masterpiece while I was dreaming
How does it feel to feel like you?
Brilliant sugar, brilliant sugar, brilliant sugar, turn over A cool, tall, drink of water
is all you ever wanted to be
And if you had another wish to wish
you'd be fun and moving But you can't talk to people, right?
You can't tell a story
You're tall, long legged
and your heart's full of liquor
And me and everybody are just ice in a glass Try to figure out and laugh yourself to the showers
Burn yourself alive and join the monster squad
They say in this place you can reinvent yourself Well you've done it again, Virginia
Made another masterpiece while I was dreaming
How does it feel to feel like you?
Brilliant sugar, brilliant sugar, brilliant sugar, turn over Be still for a second while I try and try to pin your flowers on
La, la, la, la, la
Can you carry my drink, I have everything else
I can tie my tie all by myself
I'm getting tied, I'm forgetting why Oh, we're so disarming, darling, everything we did believe
Is diving, diving, diving, diving off the balcony
Tired and wired, we ruin too easy
Sleep in our clothes and wait for winter to leave Hold ourselves together
With our arms around the stereo for hours
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
While it sings to itself or whatever it does
When it sings to itself of its long lost loves
I'm getting tied, I'm forgetting why Tired and wired, we ruin too easy
Sleep in our clothes and wait for winter to leave
And I'll be with you, behind the couch
When they come on a different day, just like this one We'll stay inside till somebody finds us
Do whatever the TV tells us
Stay inside our rosy-minded fuzz for days
We'll stay inside till somebody finds us
Do whatever the TV tells us
Stay inside our rosy-minded fuzz So worry not, all things are well
We'll be alright, we have our looks and perfume Stay inside till somebody finds us
Do whatever the TV tells us
Stay inside our rosy-minded fuzz So worry not, all things are well
We'll be alright, we have our looks and perfume on Everybody needs a prayer and needs a friend
Everybody knows the world's about to end
Everybody wants to know what the end will be
Everybody wants to look before they leap
Everybody wants a sip of wine to drink
Everybody wants a little more time to think
Everybody needs a reason why they run
Everybody wants to know what they're running from And I can see your fever's on the rise
I can see the waters in your eyes
And I can see the way the water leads
Love will lead us all to smithereens
Dying is easy, I believe my love, and my love relieves me
Dying is easy, I believe my love, and my love relieves me
You said it was everything Everybody takes forever to fall asleep,
Everybody's got a love they don't want to keep
Everybody needs a prayer, needs a friend
Everybody knows the world's about to end And I can see your fever's on the rise
I can see the waters in your eyes
And I can see the way the water leads
Love will lead us to smithereens
Dying is easy, I believe my love and my love relieves me
Dying is easy, I believe my love and my love relieves me
You said it was everything
And I'm gonna let it in Oh, well I just don't know
How you could go without permission
Cause where (well?) if you're not there
Well I just don't care for this omission Every moment brings me down when you're not around
But all I'm asking for is come back for just one day So where did you go
And do you now know how to be happy
Cause here well it's pretty clear
When you're not near me I am unhappy Every moment brings me down when you're not around
But all I'm asking for is come back for just one day
And make it worth the while just to see your smile
That's all I'm asking for Oh I've come to know
You had to go without permission
Cause it was how, how I wore you down
And how I dragged you round my sole ambition Every moment brings me down when you're not around
But all I'm asking for is come back for just one day
And make it worth the while just to see your smile
That's all I'm asking for, my dear On my feet I stand tonight
Stand and step up to the light
An extraordinary man
Unbroken in a breaking light Forever after days
Stand and make myself a crown
To the table I step alone
Hold my own above the ground Take my shot under the light
Heroes come the common way
Pull myself into the sky
Wrap me in the banner I made On my feet I stand tonight
Stand alone inside the air
An extraordinary man
Everything stops and holds me there Forever after days
Stand and make myself a crown
To the table I step alone
And hold my own above the ground Take my shot under the light
Heroes come the common way
Pull myself into the sky
Wrap me in the banner I made Forever after days
Stand and make myself a crown
To the table I step alone
And hold my own above the ground Take my shot under the light
Heroes come the common way
Pull myself into the sky
Wrap me in the banner I made


I was surprised, I was happy for a day in 1975
I was puzzled by a dream, stayed with me all day in 1995 
My brother had confessed that he was gay
It took the heat off me for a while
He stood up with a sailor friend
Made it known upon my sisters wedding day 

I got married in a rush to save a kid from being deported
Now she's in love
I was so touched, I was moved to kick the crutches
From my crippled friend
She was not impressed that I cured her on the Sabbath
So I went to confess
When she saw the funny side, we introduced my child bride
To whisky and gin

The priest in the booth had a photographic memory
For all he had heard
He took all of my sins and he wrote a pocket novel called
"The State I Am In"
So I gave myself to God
There was a pregnant pause before he said ok
Now I spend my day turning tables round In Marks & Spencer's
They don't seem to mind

I gave myself to sin
I gave myself to Providence
And I've been there and back again
The state that I am in

Oh love of mine, would you condescend to help me
Cause I am stupid and blind
And desperation is the Devil's work, it is the folly of a boy's empty mind
Now I'm feeling dangerous, riding on city buses for a hobby is sad
Lead me to a living end
I promised that I'd entertain my crippled friend
My crippled friend

I gave myself to sin
I gave myself to Providence
And I've been there and back again
The state that I am in
[x4]

I gave myself to sin
And I've been there and back again
Oh yeah


Monday morning wake up knowing that you've got to go to school
Tell your mum what to expect, she says it's right out of the blue
Do you want to work in Debenham's, because that's what they expect
Start in Lingerie, and Doris is your supervisor

And the head said that you always were a queer one from the start
For careers you say you went to be remembered for your art
Your obsession gets you known throughout the school for being strange
Making life-size models of the Velvet Underground in clay

In the queue for lunch they take the piss, you've got no appetite
And the rumour is you never go with boys and you are tight
So they jab you with a fork, you drop the tray and go berserk
While your cleaning up the mess the teacher's looking up your skirt

Hey, you've been used
Are you calm? Settle down
Write a song, I'll sing along 
Soon you will know that you are sane
You're on top of the world again

Monday morning wake up knowing that you've got to go to school
Tell your mum what to expect, she says it's right out of the blue
Do you went to work in C&A, 'cause that's what they expect
Move to laundry and take a feel off Joe the Storeman

Tell Veronica the secret of the boy you never kissed 
She's got everything to gain 'cause she's a fat girl with a lisp
She sticks up for you when you get aggravation from the snobs
'Cause you can't afford a blazer girl you're always wearing clogs

At the interval you lock yourself away inside a room 
Head of English gets you, asks you, "What the Hell do you think you're doing?"
"Do you think you're better then the other kids? Well get outside."
You've got permission, but you've got to make the bastard think he's right 

Hey, you've been used
Write a song, I'll sing along
Are you calm? Settle down
Soon you will know that you are sane
You're on top of the world again

And you cool and you know
You're a star and you'll go far
Listen to me as a friend
Not just a boy who play guitar
You're on top of the world again


Lisa knows a girl who's been abused
It changed her philosophy in '82
She's always looking for a fight
She keeps the neighbours up all night

I go to her when I'm feeling slack
The girl's using me as a punching bag
I think that I could help her out
But the girl's got a lot to be mad about

And in the first moment of her waking up
She knows she's losing it, yeah she's losing it
When the first cup of coffee tastes like washing up
She knows she's losing it, yeah she's losing
Yeah she's losing it

Lisa met Chelsea at the knocking school
Chelsea didn't feel like following the rules
So they left the place for another school
Where the boys go with boys and the girls with girls

Chelsea was the girl who's been abused
It changed her philosophy in '82
She says, "Inch for inch and pound for pound"
Who needs boys when there's Lisa round?"

And in the first moment of her waking up
She knows she's losing it, yeah she's losing it
When the first cup of coffee tastes like washing up
She knows she's losing it, yeah she's losing it
She goes to the mirror to put on her stuff
She knows she's losing it, oh yeah she's losing it
When she doesn't speak to anyone till four 0' clock
She knows she's losing it, yeah she's losing it
Oh yeah she's losing it


You're just a baby, baby girl
So kiss me on the cheek and then go off to sleep
You're just a baby, baby girl
So kiss me on the cheek before you know what's sweet
You will be working in the morning
And I won't be there to see you go off you're head
You will be working in the morning
And I won't be there to see you go off you're head

There must be a reason for all the looks we gave
And all the things we never said before
So what's the score?
Cause there must be a reason for all the looks we gave
And all the things we never said before

You're just a baby, baby girl
So kiss me on the cheek before you go to school
You're just a baby, baby girl
So kiss me on the cheek before you know what's cool
You will be crying in the morning
And I won't be there to see you go off you're head
Yeah, you will be crying in the morning
And I won't be there to see you go off you're head

[Refrain]

You're just a baby, baby girl
So kiss me on the cheek and then go off to sleep
You're just a baby, baby girl
So let go of my hand so we can get some sleep
I will be leaving in the morning
And I won't be there to see you go off you're head
Yeah I will be leaving in the morning
And I won't be there to see you go off you're head


Play a game with your electronics
Take a step to the discotheque, and people
Go outside where there's someone watching cars go by
And the city tall with steeples

Hand in hand with the Electronic Renaissance Is the way to go
Hand in hand with the Electronic Renaissance is the way to go, boy
Hand in hand with the Electronic Renaissance is the way to go
You're learning, soon you will do the things you wanted 
Since you were wearing glitter badges

If you dance for much very longer
You'll be known as the boy who's always dancing
If you work for much very longer
You'll be known as the boy who's always working 

Monochrome in the 1990's
You go disco and I'll go my way
Monochrome in the 1990's
You go disco and I'll go my way
Monochrome in the 1990's
You go disco and I'll go Funkadelic, man
Is the way to go
So drop a pill and then say hello


I could be dreaming
I could have ordinary people chasing me from town to town
Mission Impossible
They've got a spy for every blink of your eye 

I'm feeling hunted
I'm feeling haunted
They've got a knife for every time you take the same train into work
A family's like a loaded gun
You point it in the wrong direction someone's going to get killed

If you had such a dream
Would you get up and do the things you've been dreaming

Is he your husband?
Or just your boyfriend?
Is he the moron who's been beating you and keeping you inside?
I've never done this kind of thing
But if I kill him now, who's going to miss him?

I went up to the school
I went up Castlehill
For every step there is a local boy who wants to be a hero
Do you want to do it now?
Outside the butchers with a knife and a bike chain


On a beech tree rudely carved
NC was here
Why did she do it?
Was she scared or sad?

On a beech tree rudely carved
NC loved me
Why did she do it?
Was she bored, or pushed

Do something pretty while you can
Don't be a fool
Reading the Gospel to yourself is fine

Do something pretty while you can
Don't be afraid
Skating a pirouette on ice is cool

On a bus stop in the town
"We Rule The School"
Written for everyone to see and read

On a bus stop in the town
"We Rule The School"
Written for everyone with eyes in their head

Do something pretty while you can
Don't fall asleep
Driving from California to New York

Call me a prophet if you like
It's no secret
You know the world is made for men
You know the world is made for men
You know the world is made for men
Not us


You know my wandering days are over
Does that mean that I'm getting boring?
You tell me
I'm tired of listening to myself now
I'm tired of fixing things for Michael and the rest of them

You know my bip-bopping days are over
I hung my boots up and then retired from the disco floor
Now the centre of my so called being is
The space between your bed and wardrobe with the louvre doors

I said "My celibate days are over"
You put me straight on the finer points of my speech rehearsed
In the mirror of my steamy bathroom
Where the lino tells a sorry story in a monologue

Six months on, the winter's gone
The disenchanted pony 
Left the town with the circus boy
The circus boy got lonely 
It's summer, and it's sister song's 
Been written for the lonely 
The circus boy is feeling melancholy

It's got to be fate that's doing it
A spooky witch in a sexy dress has been bugging me
With the story of the way it should be
With the story of Sebastian and Belle the singer

I said "My one man band is over"
I hit the drum for the final time and I walked away
I sew you in Japanese restaurant
You were doing it for business men on the piano, Belle
You said it was a living Hell
You said that it was Hell


I don't love anyone
You're not listening
You're playing with something
You're playing with yourself

I don't love anyone
You're not listening even now
You're playing with someone
You're playing with someone else

And if there's one thing that I learned when I was a child
It's to take a hiding

I don't love anything
Not even Christmas
Especially not that
I don't love anything

No, I don't love anyone
Maybe my sister
Maybe my baby brother too, yeah
I don't love anyone

But if there's one thing that I learned when I was still a child
It's to take a hiding
Yeah if there's one thing that I learned when I was still at school
It's to be alone

Out in the street today
The kids are playing, having fun
I pass them by I'm not a kid, no
I don't love anyone

I met a man today
He told me something pretty strange
There's always somebody saying something
He said, "The world is as soft as lace."

But I don't love anyone


Mary Jo, sitting alone
Drinking tea, she just got home
She wants, I don't know what you want

Mary Jo, living alone
Drinking gin with the telly on
She wants

The night to follow day and back again
She doesn't want to sleep
Well who could blame her if she wants?
The night to follow day and back again
She doesn't want to sleep
Well who could blame her, if she sleeps?
Well who could blame her, if she sleeps?
Well who could blame her, if she's sleeping?

Mary Jo, back with yourself
For company, keep telling yourself you're young
It'll happen soon

Mary Jo, no one can see
What you've been through
Now you've got love to burn

It's someone else's turn to go through Hell
Now you can see them come from twenty yards
Yeah you can tell
It's someone else's turn to take a fall
And now you are the one who's strong enough to help them
The one who's strong enough to help them
The one who's strong enough to help them all

Mary Jo, you're looking thin
You're reading a book, "The State I Am In"
But oh, it doesn't help at all
What you want is a cigarette
And a thespian with a caravanette in Hull

Because life is never dull in your dreams
A pity that it never seems to work the way you see it
Life is never dull in your dreams
A sorry tale of action and the men you left for
Women, and the men you left for
Intrigue, and the men you left for dead


Make a new cult every day to suit your affairs
Kissing girls in English, at the back of the stairs
You're a honey, with a following of innocent boys
They never know it
Because you never show it
You always get your way
They never know it
Because you never show it
You always get your way
Have you and her been taking pictures of your obsessions?
Because I met a kid who went through one of your sessions
In his blue velour and silk
You liberated
A boy I never rated
And now he's throwing discuss
For Liverpool and Widnes
You liberated
A boy I never rated
And now he's doing business

The stars of track and field, you are
The stars of track and field, you are
The stars of track and field are beautiful people

Could I write a piece about you now that you've made it?
About the hours spent, the emptiness in your training
You only did it so that you could wear
Your terry underwear
And feel the city air
Run past your body

Could I write a requiem for you when you're dead?
"She had the moves, she had the speed, it went to her head"
She never needed anything to get her round the track
But when she's on her back
She had the knowledge
To get her into college
But when she's on her back
She had the knowledge
To get her into college


We lay on the bed there
Kissing just for practice
Could we please be objective?
Cause the other boys are queuing up behind us
A hand over my mouth
A hand over the window
Well, if I remain passive and you just want to cuddle
Then we should be ok, and we won't get into trouble
Cause we're seeing other people
At least that's what we say we are doing

How are you feeling?
I don't think you can be dealing
With the situation very well
You take a lover for a dirty weekend, that's ok
But when it's over
You are looking at the working week in the eyes of a gigolo

You're kissing your elbow
You're kissing your reflection
And you can't understand why all the other boys are going for the
New, tall, elegant rich kids
I'll admit it is a bitch, kid
But if they don't see the quality then it is apparent that
You're going to have to change
Or you're going to have to go with girls
You might be better off
At least they know what they're doing

We lay on the bed there
Kissing just for practice
Could we please be objective?
Cause the other boys are queuing up behind us
A hand over my mouth
A hand over the window
Well, if I remain passive and you just want to cuddle
Then we should be ok, and we won't get into trouble
Cause we're seeing other people
At least that's what we say we are doing


Me and the Major could become close friends cause we
Get on the same train and he wants to talk to me
Me and the Major could become close friends cause we
Get on the same train and he wants to talk
But there is too much history, too much biography between us

Me and the Major don't see eye to eye on a
Number of things, he'll take a guy like me and then
Me and the Major don't see eye to eye on a
Number of things, he'll take a guy like me
And put him in the army
Cause the Queen's own army makes a man of you

But he doesn't understand and he doesn't try
He knows there's something missing and he knows it's you and I
We're the younger generation, we grew up fast
All the others did drugs
They're taking it out on us
They're taking it out on us

Me and the Major are from different worlds, but if
I get stuck in the lift it's always with a toff
Me and the Major are from different worlds, but if
I get stuck in the lift it's always with a man
Of noble standing who looks down on me like I was never born

I think the Major's going quite insane, he goes
Along the pavement and comes back again, oh yeah
I think the Major's going quite insane, he goes
Along the pavement and comes back again
Like he is on parade, and he is on parade
At least he thinks so

Now he is swapping his tent for a sheltered home
He doesn't have a family, he is living alone
He remembers all the punks and the hippies too
And he remembers Roxy Music in seventy-two
He doesn't understand and he doesn't try
He knows there's something missing and he knows it's you and I
We're the younger generation, we grew up fast
All the others did drugs
They're taking it out on us
They're taking it out on us
They're taking it out on us

I want a dance, I want a drink of whisky so I
Forget the Major and go up the town
Because the snow is falling


Lisa's kissing men like a long walk home
When the music stops
Take a tip from me, don't go through the park
When you're on your own, it's a long walk home

If they follow you
Don't look back
Like Dylan in the movies
On your own
If they follow you
It's not your money that they're after boy it's you

Pure easy listening, settle down
On the pillow soft when they've all gone home
You can concentrate on the ones you love
You can concentrate, hey, now they've gone

If they follow you
Don't look back
Like Dylan in the movies
On your own
If they follow you
It's not your money that they're after boy it's you

Yeah you're worth the trouble and you're worth the pain
And you're worth the worry, I would do the same
If we all went back to another time
I will love you over
I will love you

If they follow you
Don't look back
Like Dylan in the movies
On your own
If they follow you
Tenderly you turn the light off in your room


Fox in the snow, where do you go
To find something you can eat?
Cause the word out on the street is you are starving
Don't let yourself grow hungry now
Don't let yourself grow cold
Fox in the snow
Girl in the snow, where will you go
To find someone that will do?
To tell someone all the truth before it kills you
They listen to your crazy laugh
Before you hang a right
And disappear from sight
What do they know anyway?
You'll read it in a book
What do they know anyway?
You'll read it in a book tonight

Boy on the bike, what are you like
As you cycle round the town?
You're going up, you're going down
You're going nowhere
It's not as if they're paying you
It's not as if it's fun
At least not anymore
When your legs are black and blue
It's time to take a break
When your legs are black and blue
It's time to take a holiday

Kid in the snow, way to go
It only happens once a year
It only happens once a lifetime
Make the most of it
Second just to being born
Second to dying to
What else could you do?


Ooh! Get me away from here I'm dying
Play me a song to set me free
Nobody writes them like they used to
So it may as well be me
Here on my own now after hours
Here on my own now on a bus
Think of it this way
You could either be successful or be us
With our winning smiles, and us
With our catchy tunes, and us
Now we're photogenic
You know, we don't stand a chance
Oh, I'll settle down with some old story
About a boy who's just like me
Thought there was love in everything and everyone
You're so naive!
They always reach a sorry end
After a while they always get it
Still it was worth it as I turned the pages solemnly, and then
With a winning smile, the boy
With naivety succeeds
At the final moment, I cried
I always cry at endings

Oh, that wasn't what I meant to say at all
From where I'm sitting, rain
Falling against the lonely tenement
Has set my mind to wander
Into the windows of my lovers
They never know unless I write
"This is no declaration, I just thought I'd let you know goodbye"
Said the hero in the story
"It is mightier than swords
I could kill you sure
But I could only make you cry with these words"


Anthony walked to his death because he thought he'd never feel this way again
If he goes back to the house then things would go from bad to worse, what could he do?
He wants to remember things exactly as he left them on that Wednesday 
And if there is something else beyond, he isn't scared because 
It's bound to be less boring than today
It's bound to be less boring than tomorrow
Hilary walked to her death because she couldn't think of anything to say 
Everybody thought that she was boring, so they never listened anyway 
Nobody was really saying anything of interest, she fell asleep She was into S&M and bible studies
Not everyone's cup of tea she would admit to me
Her cup of tea, she would admit to no one
Her cup of tea, she would admit to me
Oh but her cup of tea, she would admit to no one

Hilary went to the Catholic Church because she wanted information 
The vicar, or whatever, took her to one side and gave her confirmation 
Saint Theresa's calling her, the church up on the hill is looking lovely 
But it doesn't interest, the only things she wants to know is How and why and when and where to go
How and why and when and where to follow
How and why and when and where to go
How and why and when and where to follow

But if you are feeling sinister
Go off and see a minister
He'll try in vain to take away the pain of being a hopeless unbeliever 

When she got back, her spirituality was thrown into confusion
So she got a special deal on renting
From the man at Rediffusion
"Look at me! I'm on TV
It makes up for the shortcomings of being poor
Now I'm in a million pieces", picked up for deliberation
By the people listening at home
By the people watching on the telly
By the people listening at home
By the people watching on the telly

But if you are feeling sinister
Go off and see a minister
Chances are you'll probably feel better
If you stayed and played with yourself


Lovesick on a sunny afternoon 
You are tired of stopping in
You are waiting for the time
Mayfly, woken up when skys are clear
I don't mind you coming near
Keep me company till she comes again
You are the one who's privy to
I am the one who's making do
Because you saw him in the park
Because you saw him at the bridges with the people in the park
Cana was the start of something big
You were there in the beginning
You were there to see him play
Mayfly, woken up when sky's are blue
I don't mind the sight of you
Keep me company till she comes around
You are the one who's privy to
I am the one who's making do
Because you saw him at the celebrations standing at the side
He had the moves to save the day
But you would love him anyway

Lovesick, it came back upon yourself
You are the girl left on the shelf
You are incapable of playing the fool
Longing:so what's different today?
You sent the boys and girls away
You are concerned with matters lofty
But puzzled so it makes you sick
Your diary's looking like a bible with it's verses lost in time
And lost in meaning for the people who surround you
It's a crying shame
You know it's a crying shame


The boy done wrong again
Hang your head in shame and cry your life away
The boy done wrong again
Hang your head in shame and cry your life away
Are you ok now?
Are you ok now?
On Saturday I was an angel shining fair
You shone louder, longer
You put my shine to shame
Put me to shame now
Put me to shame

What is it I must do to pay for all my crimes?
What is it I must do?
I would do it all the time

All I wanted was to sing the saddest songs
If somebody sings along I will be happy now

The woodland spring will put the darkness from your thinking
If this town's your sinking ship
Then you know where to jump

Talking dirty, for a hobby it's fine
So pour another glass of wine
I'll think of England this time

All I wanted was to sing the saddest songs
If somebody sings along I will be happy now


Judy wrote the saddest song
She showed it to a boy in school today
Judy, where did you go wrong?
You used to make me smile when I was down
Judy was a teenage rebel
She did it with a boy when she was young
She gave herself to books and learning
She gave herself to being number one
Judy, I don't know you if you're gonna show me everything
Judy, I don't know you if you're gonna show me everything

Judy got a book at school
She went under the cover with her torch
She fell asleep till it was morning
She dreamt about the girl who stole a horse
Judy never felt so good except when she was sleeping
Judy never felt so good except when she was sleeping

Judy, let's go for a walk
We can kiss and whatever you want
But you will be disappointed
You will asleep with ants in your pants
Judy, you're just trying to find and keep the dream of horses
And the song she wrote was Judy and the Dream of Horses
Dream of Horses
You dream of horses

The best looking boys are taken
The best looking boys are staying inside
So Judy, where does that leave you?
Walking the street from morning to night
With a star upon your shoulder lighting up the path that you walk
With a parrot on your shoulder, saying everything when you talk
If you're ever feeling blue
Then write another song about your dream of horses
Write a song about your dream of horses
Call it Judy And The Dream Of Horses
Call it Judy And The Dream Of Horses
You dream of horses


He had a stroke at the age of 24
It could have been a brilliant career
Painting lines in a school that was too well known
Painting lines with a friend that had gone before
She challenged everyone to a fight
But the prefects all backed down
And they ran her out of town
Cause she drank and swore and spoke
Out of turn, she was the village joke
She had a stroke at the age of 24 
It could have been a brilliant career 
Getting clients to finance her strategies 
Filling time in on Safeways on Saturday 
She wears the clothes of an emperor 
But her paintings are a sham 
And they're going for a grand 
When the dealers come to view 
Do they ever see the real you?

He had a stroke at the age of 24 
It could have been a brilliant career 
Selling lies to the boys with the old Dansettes
Pulling the wool, playing the fool, it's no wonder that
He is dribbling spit tonight 
And the one he sent away 
Was the only one who stayed 
With a spoon and a decent book 
And you can tell by the way she looks he is sorry and resigned 
As he wets himself for the final time


And the moment will come when composure returns
Put a face on the world, turn your back to the wall
And you walk twenty yards with your head in the air
Down the Liberty Hill, where the fashion brigade
Look with curious eyes on your raggedy way
And for once in your life you have nothing to say
And could this be the time when somebody will come
To say, "Look at yourself, you're not much use to anyone"

Take a walk in the park, take a valium pill
Read the letter you got from the memory girl
But it takes more than this to make sense of the day
Yeah it takes more than milk to get rid of the taste
And you trusted to this, and you trusted to that
And when you saw it all come, it was waving the flag
Of the United States of Calamity, hey!
After all that you've done boy, Im sure you're going to pay 

In the morning you come to the ladies salon
To get all fitted out for The Paperback Throne
But the people are living far away from the place
Where you wanted to help, it's a bit of a waste
And the puzzle will last till somebody will say
"There's a lot to be done while your head is still young"
If you put down your pen, leave your worries behind
Then the moment will come, and the memory will shine

Now the trouble is over, everybody got paid
Everybody is happy, they are glad that they came
Then you go to the place where you've finally found
You can look at yourself sleep the clock around


Is it wicked not to care when they say that you're mistaken
Thinking hopes and lots of dreams that aren't there? 
Is it wicked not to care when you've wasted many hours 
Talking endlessly to anyone that's there?
I know the truth awaits me
But still I hesitate because of fear

Skipping tickets making rhymes
Is that all that you believe in?
Wearing rags to make you pretty by design
Rusting armour for effect
It's not fun to watch the rust grow
For it will all be over when you're dead

Counting acts and clutching thoughts 
By the river where the moss grows 
Over rocks the water running all the time
Is it wicked when you smile Even though you feel like crying
Even though you could be sick at any time?

But if there was a sequel
Would you love me as an equal?
Would you love me till I'm dead

[Instrumental]

If there was a sequel Would you love me like an equal? 
Would you love me till I'm dead 
And if there was a sequel 
Would you love me as an equal?
Would you love me till I'm dead 
Or is there someone else instead?


Ease you're feet off in the sea
My darling it's the place to be
Take your shoes off curl your toes
And I will frame this moment in time
Troubles come and troubles go
The trouble that we've come to know
Will stay with us till we get old
Will stay with us till somebody decides to go
Decides to go
Soberly, without regret, 1 make another sandwich
And I fill my face, 1 know that things have got to you
But what can 1 do?
Suddenly, without a warning
On a pale blue morning
You decide your time is wearing thin
A conscious choice to let yourself go dangling
Hovering
It's an emergency
There's no more "wait and see"

Maybe if I shut my eves
Your trouble will be split between us
People come and people go
You're scouring everybodies face
For some small flicker of the truth
To what it is that you are going through, my boy
I left you dry
The signs were clear that you were not going anywhere
Anywhere
Save for a falling down
Everything's going wrong

Later on, as I walked home
The plough was showing, and orion
1 could see the house where you lived
I could see the house where you gave
All your time and sanity to people
Then you waited for the people to acknowledge you
They spoke in turn
But their eyes would pass over you
Over you
Who's seeing you at all?
Who's seeing You at all?


Summer in winter
Winter in springtime
You heard the birds sing
Everything will be fine
I spent the summer wasting
The time was passed so easily
But if the summer's wasted
How come that I could feel so free
I spent the summer wasting
The sky was blue beyond compare
A photograph of myself
Is all I have to show for 

Seven weeks of river walkways
Seven weeks of staying up all night

I spent the summer wasting
The time was passed so pleasantly
Say cheerio to books now
The only things I'll read are faces
1 spent the summer wasting
Under a canopy of

Seven weeks of reading papers
Seven weeks of river walkways
Seven weeks of feeling guilty
Seven weeks of staying up all night 

Summer in winter
Winter is springtime
You heard the bird say
Everything will be fine


Seymour Stein- I've been lonely
I caught a glimpse of someones face
It was mine and I'd been crying
Half a world away
Ticket for a plane
Record company man
I won't be coming to dinner

My thoughts are far away
I'm working on that day
North Country girl
1 think she's going to stay

Promises of fame, promises of fortune
LA to New York- San Francisco back to Boston
Has he ever seen Dundee?
Won't he hire a limousine?
Seymour bring her back to me

[Instrumental]

I heard dinner went well
You liked Chris's jacket
He reminded you of Johnny
Before he went Electronic

Seymour Stein- sorry I missed you
Have a nice flight home
It's a good day for flying


I dreamt I had to go to Mars.
I'm always kidding on about going to Mars for the day, but faced with the reality of it, in a dream, i was terrified..
And it wasn't going to be like a moon trip - there was three of us going, but we couldn't all go on the same ship; we had to go one at a time with a day between us.
I had to go first, and it was the thought of passing through all that black space, all the darkness with nothing in it, and then being the first one to land there, all alone... I knew it was supposed to be all dark around, with just a red surface, but what if I got there and it was light, all civilised and populated and stuff? 
So I made a plan. The other astronauts were going to be my dad and my sister, and my dad would come first after me, so i decided when i landed i would just stay in my seat until he got there, and then we could get out together and have a look around and see what sort of things were there. 
And when I woke up and I was lying in the darkness, I thought I had landed. And I just lay still for a while, waiting for my dad to get there too.


I'm lucky, I can open the door and I can walk down the street
Unlucky, I've got nowhere to go and so I follow my feet

A choice is facing you, a healthy dose of pain
A choice is facing you as you stare through the rain
A choice is facing you but I choose to refrain for today
Tomorrow we'll be back in trouble again

Dream one, you had a whole lot of fun with a comedian
Stop short of going all the way, you'll have to make it someday

Why is this happening to you, you're not a child?
Why is this happening? You've too much on your mind
Things creep up on you when you are fast asleep
You are dreaming, you are sleepy
You are stuck to the sheets

[Instrumental]

In a town so small there's no escaping you
In a town so small there's no escape from view
In a town so small there's nothing left to do

Dream two you couldn't see her face, but you saw everything else
Dream two was pretty special, easily beats loving yourself

Could you put a name to someone elses sigh?
Could you put a face to someone elses eyes?
Is it someone that you'd maybe recognise?
But it all fades into morning when you open your eyes


A mile and a half on a bus takes a long time
The odour of old prison food takes a long time to pass you by
When you've been inside
Day upon day of this wandering gets you down
Nobody gives you a chance or a dollar in this old town

Hovering silence from you is a giveaway
Squalor and smoke's not your style
"I don't like this place"
We better go
Then I compare notes with your older sister
I am a lazy gett, she is as pure as the cold driven snow
She accepts my confession

What did you learn from your time in the solitary
Cell of your mind?
There was noises, distractions from anything good
And the old prison food
Colour my life with the chaos of trouble
Cause anything's better than posh isolation
1 missed the bus
You were laid on your back
With the boy from the arab strap
With the boy from the arab strap

It's something to speak of the way you are feeling
To crowds there assembled
Do you ever feel you have gone too far?
Everyone suffers in silence a burden
The man who drives minicabs down in Old Compton
The Asian man
With his love hate affair
With his racist clientele

A central location for you is a must as you stagger about making free with your lewd and lascivious boasts 
We know you are soft cause we've all seen you dancing 
We know you are hard cause we all saw you drinking from noon
Until noon again 
You're the boy with the filthy laugh
You're the boy with the arab strap

Strapped to the table with suits from the shelter shop
Comic celebrity takes a back seat as the cigarette catches
And sets off the smoke alarm
What do you make of the cool set in London?
You're constantly updating your hit parade of your ten biggest wanks
She's a waitress and she's got style
Sunday bathtime could take a while


What was it I saw in New York? 
I'm not the same anymore 
How will I hide these feelings inside
Call my girl on the phone 
Neon lights shine bright 
Taxi cabs glide by 
Aeroplanes they fly, high up in the sky
Pretty girl says "Hi... 
What's the worst job you've had?
What do you read? 
What's driving you mad?"
Met the cigarette girl- took a note of her charms
But no cigar
Met the Indie-Cool Queen
Took me out of the bar
And showed me the scene
My little girl I can't find
She's five hours behind
It's the singer not the song
"Something's gone wrong"
Said the spider to the fly
Do I like this girl?
It's such a big world
1 like the tone of her voice
I loved the sound of her voice

When I get back to London from outer space 
Will it fall into place?
I'll hold onto my smile 
Find my girl in a while 
Look myself in the face 
Don't know what you see 
Am I playing in your movie? 
You're in my magazine 
Are you talking to me?
CHICKFACTOR


If you want me I'll be there
A boy to deal with all your problems
But part of the deal
Is for you to feel something

If you want me look me up
I don't exist in usual places
Subtle as the wind is grey

If you want me you know where I am
I saw your arms in a dream
And there were blue veins blue
Blue veins

If you want me all you have to do
Is ask a thousand questions
Triplicate and file under
"Simple things you ask to make a young boy sigh"
Young boy sigh
Young boy sigh


Hey people, looking out the window at the city below
Hey people, looking out the window, full of fun and sorrow
Hey people, looking out the window at the city below
Hey people, looking out the window, you'll be gone tomorrow
The rollercoaster ride
The rollercoaster ride
Of all the trouble kept her inside

Take Judy, with her bow and arrow, she's a mastermind
Too frumpy for the teenage population of her time
Car coat, she has a quilted jacket with a hood if it rains
Big pockets for the pharmaceuticals she takes to fix her brain

The rollercoaster ride
The rollercoaster ride
Of all the trouble kept her inside
Of all the trouble kept her inside

A puzzle, for the moment settle down to do it with him
You're happy cause your cosy and the rain comes rattling in
It tickles, and it's something that is very good for the skin
You're waiting for a baby, Baby, watch the idiot running

[Refrain]

You're hanging from the balcony upon the riverboat glass 
You're watching with your mouth wide open for the top of the class 
She came on with the boys while you were stuck in various poses 
If you were to remove your clothes d'you think the singer would notice?


I fought in a war and I left my friends behind me
To go looking for the enemy, and it wasn't very long
Before I would stand with another boy in front of me
And a corpse that just fell into me, with the bullets flying round
And I reminded myself of the words you said when we were getting on 
And I bet you're making shells back home for a steady boy to wear 
Round his neck, well it won't hurt to think of you as if you're waiting for
This letter to arrive because I'll be here quite a while

I fought in a war and I left my friends behind me
To go looking for the enemy, and it wasn't very long
Before I found out that the sickness there ahead of me
Went beyond the bedsit infamy of the decade gone before

And I reminded myself of the words you said when we were getting on 
And I bet you're making shells back home for a steady man to wear 
Round his neck, well it won't hurt to think of you as if you're waiting for
This letter to arrive because I'll be here quite a while

I fought in a war, and I didn't know where it would end
It stretched before me infinitely, I couldn't really think
Of the day beyond now, keep your head down pal
There's trouble plenty in this hour, this day
I can see hope I can see light

And I reminded myself of the looks you gave when we were getting on 
And I bet you're making shells back home for a steady man to wear 
Round his neck, well it won't hurt to think of you as if you're waiting for
This letter to arrive because I'll be here quite a while


I will confess to you
Because you made me think about the times
You turn the picture on to me and I'll turn over
The vision was a masterpiece of comic timing
But you wouldn't laugh at all
And I wonder what the boy was thinking
The picture was an old collage of something classical
The model with a tragic air
Because without a doubt he'd given up the fight
The ghost of somebody at his side
I will confess to you
Because I didn't think about the message
As I walked down the alleyway it was a Sunday
And all my friends deserted me because you painted me
As the fraud I really was
And if you think you see with just your eyes you're mad
'Cause Lisa learned a lot from putting on a blindfold
When she knew she had been bad
She met another blind kid at a fancy dress
It was the best sex she ever had

I'll send a dress to you
Because it's needing badly taken in
But I was so embarressed when I missed your party
It was me that paid for it eventually
Because you know how much I wanted
To meet your friend the star of stage and local press
The dream of all the bowlie boys that hang around here
And I'm no different from the rest
I'm not too proud to say that I'm okay with
The girl next door who's famous for showing her breasts

You're not impressed by me
But it's a funny way for you to tell me
A whisper in a choir stall
The man was talking about you simultaneously
Frankly, I let my heavy eyelids flutter
Because I have been sleeping badly lately
I know you were historical from all the books I've read
But I thought you could be bluffing
And with this chance I've missed I feel remiss
It's days and months before I see you again


Joseph was travelling with a heavy load
His dreams were broken and deep sorrow flowed from his brow
Closer to sundown he prepared to rest
Set down the burden,
lay upon his chest
Then she came

Sir, come to me and I will keep you warm
Taste hope in my skin and faith with the dawn
You will rise

Beyond the sunrise that is where we live
Feeding our counsel and true comfort give
Travelling men

Joseph was sure the liquor had caused this dream
His eyes were sure that heaven was not her scene
She was no saint
Sir, come to me and I will keep you warm
Taste hope in my skin and faith with the dawn you will rise


All the way back home
I'm telling you I caught the sun
Creeping up behind my shoulder
And another day's begun
I was following a trail
I'd never been along before
Chasing darkened skies above me
Looking like the spring
Like the winter
And the morning
If there's a place I want to go
Then I'll be there with you
'Cos in my dreams the things
I'm wishing for
Keep coming true
Now a new day comes
Clears the darkness out of sight
And the shadows that were sleeping
Come and dance beneath the light
And I'm trying hard to hide
Keeping the sun out of my eyes
Close them tight
And now I'm waiting for the moon to rise

Don't try to say to me
That this was never meant to be
'Cos the days are long where I come from
The next few days I'm free
There's a train I want to catch
But it won't leave here for a while
Till darkness fills the eastern sky
And streetlights stretch for miles
Through the spring
And the winter and the morning


It's been a bloody stupid day
My baby called me up to say
Don't call me love, don't call me
It's not all she said

I truly love her but I know
I'm bad for her, I'm bad and so
At least she may forgive me for my honesty

My friend came back from being abroad
He was rich and I was overawed
His ship came in
I'm standing on the harbour wall

Another friend, the one I love
Turns to me "Have you seen enough?"
"Let's hang about
There's nothing like a sunset"

It's been a bloody stupid day
Don't leave the light on baby
My baby called me up to say
Don't leave the light on baby
I'll see you sometime maybe
Don't leave the light on baby
It finally dawned on me tonight
Best to go down without a fight
I know you will forgive me for my honesty


I went looking for my darling, I went looking for a sign
and I found her in the morning, somewhere in the back of my mind

I'm not what I could be, I need a true love
I went looking and I found one

The wrong girl
The wrong kind
The wrong hand to be holding
The wrong eyes to go searching behind
The wrong dream to have on my mind


He raped me in the chalet lines
The girl I shared with was away for the night
I couldn't get up for my shift today
I'll have to leave the camp now anyway
I'll go to London there's a mate of mine I know
she'll give me a place
Full of woe and further to go
She caught the bus
"Oh I'll go anywhere"
She caught the bus
Her face was just a smear on the pane
He raped me in the chalet lines
I had just said no for the final time
Although it's last month it's like yesterday
I missed my time, I don't think I could stand
To take the test, I'm feeling sick
Fuck this, I've felt like this for a week
I'd put a knife right into his eyes
My friend can't see
She asks me why I don't
Tell the law
Oh what's the fucking point at all

He raped me in the chalet lines
It was a party, it was going fine
With the boys from the amusement park
A few were idiots, they were a really good laugh
They had the shows on till way after dark
I hope she'll give me a place
Full of woe and further to go
She caught the bus
"Oh I'll go anywhere"
She caught the bus
Her face was just a smear on the pane


Nice day for a sulk
The girl smells of milk
Her horsey teeth explode around us
And we run for cover she found us
In the cheapo bar with a bag of chips
Nice day for a mood
The forecast is good
The kids are melting in the doorway
Keep the gang together
There's no way will you ever be misunderstood by me

Nice day for a jam
The Fall, Manfred Mann
Dance party, summer lasts forever
When the band's together and Bobby
Drank too much and fell in the Clyde


I don't care whether you hear this
I don't care if I'm alone here singing songs to myself
There's nobody else around, around
Meet you up at the Indian part of the town
The town's shut down, the people left with their bags
Their kids so there's not a sound a sound
But I must get from there to here
There's a small voice crying on the other side of the river from here 
It's too late to phone her now
What went wrong, your grades were good
It would take a left wing Robin Hood to pay for school
Your dad's a boozer and you keep him alive

Just a minute close your eyes
If we settle for this compromise I'll stay with you
The river looks so good tonight
I don't know what's with your friend
She met a boy and at the summer's end
She said she'd had enough of playing games

I don't care cause I'm by myself
All the dancers left but I can't dance
So I will stay and clean the mess they left behind
But I dream as I set to scrub all the floors, the walls
I'm thinking of a song or two, a boy a girl a rendezvous

Are you coming or are you not?
There is nothing that would sort you out
There's nothing I could say or do
You're going to crash, I'll set the bails in front of you
Are you coming or are you not?
There is nothing that would sort you out
An interesting way of life
Deny yourself the benefits of being alive

You slept better in a sleeping train in a shed in a station
With a torch and a Woman's Realm to keep you warm
To keep you company
You slept better in a sleeping train in a shed in a station
With a torch and a Woman's Realm to keep you company tonight


I've been feeling down
I've been looking round the town
For somebody just like me
But the only ones I see
Are the dummies in the window
They spend their money on clothes
It saddens me to think
That the only ones I see are mannequins
Looking stupid, being used and being thin
And I don't know why I hang around with them
The way they act, I'd rather be fat than be confused
The way they act, I'd rather be fat than be confused
Than be me in a cage
With a bottle of rage
And a family like the mafia

I've been feeling blue
And I don't know what to do
And I never get a thrill
And they threw me out of school
'Cause I swore at all the teachers
Because they never teach us
A thing I want to know
We do Chemistry, Biology and Maths
I want Poetry and Music and some laughs
And I don't think it's an awful lot to ask

So won't you please get up off your knees, and let me go
So won't you please get up off your knees, and let me go
Cause I'm here in a cage
With a bottle of rage
And a family like the mafia

If my family tree goes back to the Romans
Then I will change my name to Jones
If my family tree goes back to Napolean
Then I will change my name to Smith
If my family tree goes back to the Romans
Then I will change my name to Jones
If you're looking at me to be an accountant
Then you will look but you will never see
If you're looking at me to start having babies
Then you can wish because I'm not here to fool around
You can wish because I'm not here to fool around
You can wish because I'm not here to fool around


I could hang about and burn my fingers
I've been hanging out here waiting for something to start
You think I'm faultless to a 't'
My manner set impeccably
But underneath I am the same as you

I could dance all night like I'm a soul boy
But you know I'd rather drag myself across the dance floor
I feel like dancing on my own
Where no one knows me, and where I
Can cause offence just by the way I look

And when I come to blows
When I am numbering my foes
Just hope that you are on my side my dear

But it's best to finish as it started
With my face head down just staring at the brown formica
It's safer not to look around
I can't hide my feelings from you now
There's too much love to go around these days

You say I've got another face
That's not a fault of mine these days
I'm brutal, honest and afraid of you

It's safer not to look around
There's no hide my feelings from you now
There's too much love to go around these days

You say I've got another face
That's not a fault of mine these days
I'm honest, brutal and afraid of you


In the summer all the hikers hike out for the highest peaks
All the children watch the cricket and they never wash for weeks 
In the suburbs young protestors write "Black And White United" 
They're tearing up the streets
I'm in love with every girl I meet
The gasman loves the street
He loves to drill
He loves to think about his girl
The sun is melting half the street

In the summer all the workers head out for the sandy beach
Stay together in all weather
Entertainment through your grief
Communities of predjudices travel on the train
The upperclass will have to pass the chance up of a knees-up with the gang 
Your record profits will buy you an island

There's a jigsaw with a picture, all the country as a map
Kiers hiking, cyclers cycling, if I go I'm not coming back
I'm all in love with all the girls I meet, the hardcore summer kind
Kitchen porters, budding painters, whiskey touring guides

In the rain all your plans will fade
You'll be left with the jigsaw


Picture a scene in your mind
Look at all the people and take note of the setting behind
Listen, watch, and wait
A plot beings to take shape
There's a story
And then characters will come to you
Relating events as they choose to
But all their words and actions come entirely from you
If you're a storyteller you might think you're without responsibility 
And you can lead your characters anywhere you want
You have immunity

Have you considered the way
People might react to all the things that your characters say?
And are their actions hand in hand with what you want to portray? 
Are you sick?
Arre you crippled? Insane?
Expressing the desires that daren't speak their name?
Are you the one to blamed?
Now you're a storyteller you might think you're without responsibility
But in directions, actions and words
Cause and effect
You need consistency How can you finish the tale?
Lives which have played a part
Are summarised from the very start
And episodes left out to make it all go your way
"It's a mighty big world Some of it I've seen
But mostly I've only heard
And stories are all fiction from their moment of birth"
You're just a storyteller
You're not trying to escape responsibilty
If we believe you then you're successful
But you don't make claims of verity


I don't want to play football
I don't understand the thrill of the game
I don't want to play football
I don't understand the thrill of running, catching, throwing
Taking orders from a moron
Grabbing for the sweaty crotches
Getting hit by people I don't know
Sugar, I'd rather play a different sort of game
Sugar, the girls are just as good as boys at playing


Wandering alone on the ridge of the coast
lost to the world he had known as a boy
He knows his lover lies south in the city
Passing along and as sleepy as night
Warm in the woods that conceal him from light
he is accustomed to hiding from people

Taking his time as he crosse the bridge
Holding the flowers he picked from the ridge
Walking in shadows to his senorita

Safe in the dawn he gest under the sheets
His Senorita a heavenly sweet soul
That was put there to save and protect him

He knows that time can not endlessly go
Traps will be set by the people below
She will be caught too and he could not bear it

Hope in the freedom he can almost touch
Folk take for granted as they walk to church
He says his prayers and God listens to him

Sir all I want is a chance to amend
Past infidelities please do not send
Me far away from my wise
Me far away from my wise
Me far away from my wise Senorita


I'm coming over in the wrong direction
I only want to be the centre of your attention
For long enough to show you I'm worth the trouble that you take

I want to see the way that you portray
A boy who's going to try to change his life today ...

I want to see the way that you portray
A boy who maybe doesn't have too much to say
And you can draw your own conclusions
But you'll find I'm not a fake

You can turn away from me
But there's nothing that will keep me here you know
And you'll never be the city guy
And more than I'll be hosting The Scooby Show


I'll make another movie
The same on as the year before
Take a tired idea
Put it in the hands of Hollywood
I need to talk to someone
I've been living someone else's life
I don't get no mail at my house anymore
My manager's my bride

I'm sitting on a jet plane
I'll see my baby soon enough
I won't take her to the movie
I'm worried that the lines become all blurred
I couldn't help but feeling something
When the boss told us to act that way
I'm ashamed of my profession
I would do the same again

I'll make another movie
Same one as the year befroe
I'm looking for a story
Something ludicrous to come up from the street
I won't play another heavyweight
I won't play another big John Shaft
Put me in a frock and leave me to recite
Maybe my career will die
?


She called me up today
Meet me down at the old cafe
I jumped into the shower
I was getting my marching orders 

We need to talk
Step into my office, baby
I want to give you the job
A chance of overtime
Say, my place at nine? 

She'd never stand for any lies
She's got an Out Tray full of guys
I could sense a breath, a whole new feeling
Now she says she wants to call a meeting

We need to talk
Step into my office, baby
I want to give you the job
A chance of overtime
Say, my place at nine?

I'm a slave to work
I'm only living when I walk amongst the office staff
And catch up with the office wag
I'll be in bed by nine
My curtains drawn 
My thoughts composed
I get to work on time

She gave me some dictation 
But my strength is in administration
I took down all she said
I even took down her little red dress

We need to talk
Step into my office, baby
Wanna give you the job
I'm pushing for a raise
Been pushing now for days

My output is in decline
I was burned out after Thatcher
My banner I laid down with a sigh
Now I doubt if I'll ever catch her

I've got to change my ways
Dress for business every day
A sharp suit and a kipper tie
A big arrow pointing to my fly

Have you shaved for work yet, baby?
Don't care where the boss is, baby

We need to talk
Step into my office, baby
I want to give you the job
A chance of overtime
Say, my place at nine?


Dear Catastrophe Waitress
Dear Catastrophe Waitress
I'm sorry if you seem to have the weight of the world over you
I cherish your smile
There's a word of peace on your lips
Say it, and with tenderness I'll cherish you
I'll cherish you

Dear Catastrophe Girlfriend
Dear Catastrophe Girlfriend
I'm sorry if he hit you with a full can of Coke
It's no joke
Your face is bleeding
You'll soon be leaving this town to the clowns who worship
No one but themselves
No one but themselves

I hate feeling this way, oh
I hate feeling this way, oh
I know you hate it too, oh
Now that your coffee's growing cold, oh
All of the customers look so old, oh
Honey if I could be so bold

Dear Catastrophe Waitress
Dear Catastrophe Waitress
I'm sorry if the kids hold you in cool disregard
I know it's hard
Stick to what you know
You'll blow them all to the wall
When they realise what you've been working for
What you've been working for
What you've been working for


I wrote a letter on a nothing day
I asked somebody 'Could you send my letter away'?
'You are too young to put all of your hopes in just one envelope' 
I said goodbye to someone that I love
It's not just me, I tell you it's the both of us
And it was hard
Like coming off the pills that you take to stay happy
Someone above has seen me do alright
Someone above is looking with a tender eye
Upon her face, you may think you're alone but you may think again 
If I could do just one near perfect thing I'd be happy
They'd write it on my grave, or when they scattered my ashes
On second thoughts I'd rather hang about and be there with my best friend 
If she wants me

And far away somebody read the letter
He condescends to read the words I wrote about him
And if he smiles, it's no more than a genius deserves
For all his curious nerve and his passion

I'm going deaf, you're growing melancholy
Things fall apart, I don't know why we bother at all
But life is good and 'It's always worth living at least for a while'

If I could do just one near perfect thing I'd be happy
They'd write it on my grave, or when they scattered my ashes
On second thoughts I'd rather hang about and be there with my best friend 
If she wants me

If you think to yourself 'What should I do now'?
Then take the baton, girl, you better run with it
There is no point in standing in the past cause it's over and done with 

I took a book and went into the forest
I climbed the hill, I wanted to look down on you
But all I saw was twenty miles of wilderness so I went home


Elope with me Miss Private and we'll sail around the world
I will be your Ferdinand and you my wayward girl
How many nights of talking in hotel rooms can you take?
How many nights of limping round on pagan holidays?
Oh elope with me in private and we'll set something ablaze
A trail for the devil to erase

San Francisco's calling us, the Giants and Mets will play
Piazza, New York catcher, are you straight or are you gay?
We hung about the stadium, we've got no place to stay
We hung about the tenderloin and tenderly you tell
About the saddest book you ever read
It always makes you cry
The statue's crying too and well he may

I love you I've a drowning grip on your adoring face
I love you my responsibility has found a place
Beside you and strong warnings in the guise of gentle words
Come wave upon me from the family wider net absurd
"You'll take care of her, I know it, you will do a better job"
Maybe, but not what she deserves

Elope with me Miss Private and we'll drink ourselves awake
We'll taste the coffee houses and award certificates
A privy seal to keep the feel of 1960 style
We'll comment on the decor and we'll help the passer by
And at dusk when work is over we'll continue the debate
In a borrowed bedroom virginal and spare

The catcher hits for .318 and catches every day
The pitcher puts religion first and rests on holidays
He goes into cathedrals and lies prostrate on the floor
He knows the drink affects his speed he's praying for
a doorway
Back into the life he wants and the confession of the bench
Life outside the diamond is a wrench

I wish that you were here with me to pass the dull weekend
I know it wouldn't come to love, my heroine pretend
A lady stepping from the songs we love until this day
You'd settle for an epitaph like "Walk Away, Renee"
The sun upon the roof in winter will draw you out like
a flower
Meet you at the statue in an hour
Meet you at the statue in an hour


When the half light makes for a clearer view
Sleep a little more if you want to
But restlessness has siezed me now, it's true
I could watch the dreams flicker in your eyes
Lying here asleep on a sunbeam
I wonder if you realise you fascinate me so

Think about a new destination
If you think you need inspiration
Roll out the map and mark it with a pin
I will follow every direction
Just lace up your shoes while I'm fetching a sleeping bag, a tent...

Another summer's passing by
All I need is somewhere I feel the grass beneath my feet
A walk on sand, a fire I can warm my hands
My joy will be complete

I thought about a new destination
I'm never short of new inspiration
Roll out the map and mark it with a gin
Made my plans to conquer the country
I'm waiting for you to get out of your situation 
With your job and with your life

All I need is somewhere I feel the grass beneath my feet
A walk on sand
A fire, I can warm my hands
My joy will be complete
?


I'm glad to see you
I had a funny dream
You were wearing funny shoes
You were going to a dance
You were dressed like a punk but you are too young
to remember

Glad to see you
I'm outside the house
I'm not thinking right today
I've got no energy
I'm glad that you are waiting with me
Tell me all about your day

Breaking off is misery
I see a wilderness for you and me
Punctuated by philosophy
And a wondering how things could've been

I'm happy for you
You've made it hard for me
I counted on your company
You are staying with your friends tonight
I'm feeling sorry for myself
I keep taking everything to be a sign

I'm happy for you
Now I know this hurt is poison
Too sharp to be bled
I'm sitting on my empty bed
On my empty bed
At night the fever grows it's pounding pounding

I'd rather be in Tokyo
I'd rather listen to Thin Lizzy-oh
Watch the Sunday gang in Harajuku
There's something wrong with me, I'm a cuckoo

Scary moment, lovin' every moment
I was high from playing shows
We lost a singer to her clothes
My trouble raised its ugly head
I was revealed
And I was home in bed
I was a kid again

Jesus told me, go after every coin like it was the last in
the world
And protect the wayward child
But I'm a little lost sheep
I need my Bo Peep
I know I need My Shepherd here tonight

Breaking off is misery
I see a wilderness for you and me
Punctuated by philosophy
And a wondering how things could've been

I'd like to see you
But really I should stay away
And let you settle down
I've got no claims to your crown
I was the boss of you
And I loved you
You know I loved you
It's all over now

I was there for you
When you were lonely
I was there when you were bad
I was there when you were sad
Now it's my time of need
I'm thinking, do I have to plead to get you by my side?

I'd rather be in Tokyo
I'd rather listen to Thin Lizzy-oh
Watch the Sunday gang in Harajuku
There's something wrong with me, I'm a cuckoo


Since you went away, everything is looking great
I'm a little bored
When I see you out, maybe walking in the street
You always cross the road 

Listen honey, there is nothing you can say to surprise me
Listen honey, there is nothing you can do to offend me anymore
You don't send me anymore

Our little scene is getting smaller by the day
It's a human zoo
But the key is change, getting over all your problems
You're not a fool

Listen honey, there is nothing you can say to surprise me
Listen honey, there is nothing you can do to offend me 
You don't send me

Every sound is tame, every group the bleedin' same
It would make you mad
What happened to the sounds that left you lying on the floor
Laughing, crying, jumping, singing

Listen honey, there is nothing you can say to astound me
Listen honey, there is nothing you can do to offend me anymore 
You don't send me anymore


It was pretty bright, up on the rainbow bridge tonight
I could see into your window although you're far away
You were racing in a car
Beside a boy, you just don't know if he is up for
What you have in mind
If he is up for what you have in mind 

Change is on the cards, but this time it will be hard
But I never want to leave you
We've never had a fight
You should never split a pole
You should never split at all
I wish I had two paths that I could follow
I'd write the ending without any sorrow

I will say a prayer, just while you are sitting there
I will wrap my hands around you
I know it will be fine
We've got a fantasy affair
We didn't get wet, we didn't dare
Our aspirations, are wrapped up in books
Our inclinations are hidden in looks

Summer's hastening on
I'm trying to get a feeling from the city
But I've been unfaithful
I've been travelling abroad
We've got a fantasy affair
We didn't get wet, we didn't dare
Our aspirations, are wrapped up in books
Our inclinations are hidden in looks


Anthony, bullied at school
Get your own back, now you are cool
Or are you scared?
Bunking off though you're a toff
It's all gone wrong again, you've got double maths
And the teacher's got no control so
The boys will run riot, you will stay quiet
Or you will die

Tony at the back of the gym
Smoke another one, your chances are slim
'Cos here they come again
And they got you on the ground
Tasting blood again, at least it's your own
When will you realise that it never pays
To be smarter than teachers
Smarter than most boys?
Shut your mouth, start kicking the football
Bang on the teeth, you're off for a week boy 

You may as well take it in the guts - it can't get worse
Take it in the guts - it can't get worse that this
You'll soon be old enough to leave them
And without a notion of a care
You'll lift two fingers in the air to linger there

Tony, you're a bit of a mess
Melted Toblerone under your dress
And if the boys could see you they would pass you right bye
Blue mascara running over your eye
When will you realise that it never pays
To be smarter than teachers
Smarter than most boys?
Shut your mouth, start kicking the football
Bang on the teeth, you're off for a week boy 

They call you Lord Anthony 
But hey - it could be worse than
Lord Anthony, but hey - it could be worse than
Lord Anthony, but hey - it kind of suits you anyway
You'll soon be old enough to leave them
And without a notion of a care
You'll lift two fingers in the air to linger there


If you find yourself caught in love
Say a prayer to the man above
Thank him for everything you know
You should thank him for every breath you blow

If you find yourself caught in love
Say a prayer to the man above
You should thank him for every day you pass
Thank him for saving your sorry ass

If you're single, but looking out
You must raise your prayer to a shout
Another partner must be found
Someone to take your life beyond
Another TV "I Love 1999"
Just one more box of cheapo wine

If you find yourself caught in love
You should say a prayer to the man above

If you don't listen to the voices then my friend 
You'll soon run out of choices
What a pity it would be
You talk of freedom don't you see
The only freedom that you'll ever really know
Is written in books from long ago
Give up your will to Him that loves you
Things will change, I'm not saying overnight
But something has to give
You're too good looking not to live

If you find yourself out of love
Shed a tear for the one you love
Tell your boss that you've gone away
Down your tools for a holiday
If you're going off to war then I wish you well
But don't be sore
If I cheer the other team
Killing people's not my scene
I prefer to give the inhabitants a say
Before you blow their town away
I like to watch them play
I like to marvel at the random beauty of a simple village girl
Why should she be the one who's killed? If you find yourself caught in love...


Like a fresh manifestation of an old phenomenon
A breeze whips through the trees
The rustling leaves and branches bend together
they're cued to sway
forever by the forces of the Lord's choreography

Just for a second the combination of sights, sounds 
around him
sends him hurtling back to the mirror of all of his teenager thoughts and fears
He passes big houses and family cars
they saddled the horses in cobblestone yards
He catches the moon looking down from the stars
Just like it's done for years and years

Perpetual feeling in the grown up world that's all 
around him
that there's secrets that could be revealed with knowledge and philosophy
And "Oh to be dumb, Oh to be smart"
He might be nursing a broken heart
but feeling this way he's just playing a part
that's been around for centuries

I wandered all night, I wondered all night about you
I've been here for years just wandering around the neighbourhood


I was choking on a cornflake
You said "Have some toast instead"
I was sleeping maybe three hours
You said "You should get to bed"
I was waiting at the church door
For the minister to show
I was looking at the new year
You said "Walk before you crawl"

I was feeling like a loser
You said "Hey, you've still got me" 
I was feeling pretty lonely 
You said "You wanted to be free"
I was looking for a good time
You said "Let the good times start"
With a quiver of your eyelid
You took on someone else's part

Maybe I'm a little greedy
You said "Think before you speak"
Sometimes I'm a little seedy
You said "Everyone is weak"
Now I feel a little better
Is there something I can do?
But I never heard the answer
I never had a clue

But what about me
I don't really see
How things will improve
If all you want is to stay loose

There's a little echo calling
Like a miner trapped inside
If I tell her of this moment
She will in me doubts confide
And she's on me like a blanket
Like a stalk of wilting grass
I'm not sure about her motives
I'm not sure about her past

But my faith is like a bullet
My belief is like a bolt
The only thing that lets me sleep at night
A little carriage of the soul
If it starts a little bleaker
Then the year may yet be gold
Happiness is not for keeping
Happiness is not my goal

But what about me
I don't really see
How things will improve
If all you want is to stay loose
But what about them 
You play mother hen
To a gaggle of gangling youth
All you want is to stay loose

I was living through the seconds
My composure was a mess
I was miles from tenderness
It was dark outside, the day it was lying in pieces
Everything is flat and dreary
I couldn't care what's in the news
Television is the blues
Television is hysterical laughter of people

And I know it could be me
I'm always asking for more
I keep running round in circles
I keep looking for a doorway
I'm going to need two lives
To follow the paths I've been taking


When I was a boy I was confounded by you
Now I'm still a boy I am indebted to you
Every song I ever wrote was written for you
Written for you

Now I'm feeling flat you seem mile away
I'm so tired that down on the pavement I'll lay
Till the blossom on the tree comes falling on me
Fall on me

From my window I can see the mountains in snow
From my window I will shut my eyes and let go
Promise me you'll always be around when I call
And when I fall

On the river bridge up on the wall, looking down
On the river bridge, to me a vision was shown
If I could hold on to things till I was full grown
Peace would I know

To my dog on wheels I'll tell my pleasures and woes
To my dog on wheels I'll tell my secrets and more
Then one day in spring I'll take him down to the road
Anything goes


I was surprised, I was happy for a day in 1975
I was puzzled by a dream, stayed with me all day in 1995 
My brother had confessed that he was gay
It took the heat off me for a while
He stood up with a sailor friend
Made it known upon my sisters wedding day 

I got married in a rush to save a kid from being deported
Now she's in love
I was so touched, I was moved to kick the crutches
From my crippled friend
She was not impressed that I cured her on the Sabbath
So I went to confess
When she saw the funny side, we introduced my child bride
To whisky and gin

The priest in the booth had a photographic memory
For all he had heard
He took all of my sins and he wrote a pocket novel called
"The State I Am In"
So I gave myself to God
There was a pregnant pause before he said ok
Now I spend my day turning tables round In Marks & Spencer's
They don't seem to mind

I gave myself to sin
I gave myself to Providence
And I've been there and back again
The state that I am in

Oh love of mine, would you condescend to help me
Cause I am stupid and blind
And desperation is the Devil's work, it is the folly of a boy's empty mind
Now I'm feeling dangerous, riding on city buses for a hobby is sad
Lead me to a living end
I promised that I'd entertain my crippled friend
My crippled friend

I gave myself to sin
I gave myself to Providence
And I've been there and back again
The state that I am in
[x4]

I gave myself to sin
And I've been there and back again
Oh yeah


I got my fingers dirty at the school of rock
Yeah I got my fingers dirty so I took a walk
I went up to the country park and hung around till after dark
Till the girls got home
Till the girls got home

Did I tell you 'bout the one I know, she's on the rag
She spent the summer day inside her sleeping bag
Yeah she spent the summer day inside until it's time to work
And she works all night
Cause the girl's all right

The girls have got a house that's like a caravan
And it's like your holidays whenever you go round
And we always have a laugh and then we all get in the bath
To save on the leccy bill
Me & Jo & Phil'

I had to leave them in the morning
I left the keys around the way
I had to catch a bus
I had to leave them in the morning
I left the keys down in the caf'
I had to go to work

And when Jo was short of cash I had to give her some
But I didn't really mind cause I was fit for once
So she paid the leccy bill and got the shopping and she still had
Some for the cinema
So we all went out

She asked me "Do I need to lose a bit of weight?"
And I told her "Don't be stupid 'cause you're looking great"
And I call her String Bean Jean because the label on her jeans says
Seven to eight years old - well that's pretty small
Seven to eight years old - that's pretty small
Seven to eight years old - that's pretty small
Seven to eight years old


I left the school I left my job
You saw me looking like a slob
When I was young you were the only fun in town

Everyone thought it was a shame
For Belle and the boy Sebastian
Belle was ok but oh Sebastian
Went too far again
Crashed his car in the rain

He wants to love and he wants to care
But when the boys are queuing up to tell her she's a star
Poor Sebastian is heading for a fall

Everyone thought it was a shame
For Belle and the boy Sebastian
Everyone thought it was a shame
Belle was ok but oh Sebastian
Went too far again
Crashed his car in the rain
Oh Sebastian wrote his diary that
He would never be young again
But you will
Fellow, you are ill
You'd better take a weight off of your mind and listen
To what other people say
Cause things are going wrong your own way


Working the village shop
Putting a poster up
Dreaming of anything
Dreaming of the time when you are free from all the trouble you're in 
In the mud, on your knees
Trying hard not to please
Anyone, all the time
Being a rebel's fine
But you go all the way to being brutal

You will have a boy tonight
You will have a boy tonight
On the first bus out of town
On the first bus out of town

Let's see your kit for games
All the girls look the same
You are challenging style for running miles
You're running miles in some boys jumper

Boo to the business world!
You know a girl who's tax free on her back and making
Plenty cash
While you are working for the joy of giving

You will have a boy tonight
You will have a boy tonight
And you hope that she will see
And you hope that she will see

You will have a boy tonight
Or maybe you will have a girl tonight
And you hope that she will see
And you hope that she will see

You are in two minds
Tossing a coin to decide whether you should tell your mum
About a dose of thrush you got while you were licking railings

But you read in a book
That you got free in Boots
There are lotions, there are potions
You can take to hide your shame from all those prying eyes

Lazy Jane, all the time
Painting lines
You are sleeping at bus stops
Wondering how you got your name
And what you're going to do about it

You will have a boy tonight
You will have a boy tonight
And you hope that she will see
And you hope that she will see


You made me forget my dreams
When I woke up to you sleeping
We had peace for a night at least
But the trouble starts today
This morning you'll say
"I'll see you sometime, maybe" and I
Fall back to uneasy sleep

You made me forget my dreams
I was building a space rocket
With the boy who played bass guitar
With the boy who's wearing flares
He didn't care
He lit the fuse and ran for a mile
The space rocket went up in style
The space rocket went up in style

I'll lend you two hundred quid
For a flight across the ocean
Maybe things will look better there
Because they couldn't be much worse
Than tears and a curse
For men with guns, maturing in age
Will always pay a shitty wage
They'll always pay a shitty wage

You made me forget my dreams
When I woke up to you sleeping
There was blood on the sheets again
And the view outside the window
Of gardens in bloom
Obscured by all the trouble we had
I think I better make a move
I think I better make a move


We were sitting in the living room on the sofa, the wrong way round, looking out the window.
It was quiet, and then in the car park across the road we saw Elvis - look, there beside the postman's van,
and he was walking round the postman's van, looking in the open door.
He looked as if he was thinking about getting in, but then the postman came back, and he swaggered off,
walked past the window and down the stairs, and then at the bottom of the stairs right by the caretaker's office,
he started licking the pavement.
Every night now since we moved in that new house there's this noise outside the door at just about half seven or eight o' clock every night.
And if we go and look outside the door, Elvis'll be standing there waiting to be let in.
And then he wanders into the living room, maybe sits down on one of the chairs or even lies down on the floor.
He doesn't say much, he just stays there for an hour or two, watching the TV.
We talk to him a bit, and then around ten o' clock, he'll go away again, and not come back until the next night.
There's a lot of lanes and stuff around here, around the house - although it's right in the middle of the city
it seems quite like the country, it's dead hidden - safe I suppose, made for night living.
There's a lot of squirrels and birds, and Stuart says he's seen about nine foxes there
when he's jumped over the fence on his way to Prior's Road.
Sometimes you can go out walking, and when you've been out for a wee while even you don't know where you are anymore,
so it would be pretty hard for anyone else to find you.
I suppose that's why he spends so much time there, that's why he's come to live there, or maybe it's just the squirrels.
I read about somewhere that he likes squirrels quite a lot.
There's these two videos that we got for wedding presents - called the e-files
e-files one and e-files two about how Elvis is supposed to be still alive.
And one time when he came round we were watching one of those, but he didn't say anything he just sat on the armchair.
He was playing with his collar a bit, and we watched it right through and then when it finished
he just got up and walked off into the mist and didn't say anything.
The first few times he came round I didn't speak to him at all, I wasn't really sure what to say.
And Karen spoke to him quite a lot - she seemed to know what to do more than I do.
He had quite a strange manner though, he'd go into your stuff and look through it,
then he'd maybe pick something up and play with it for a wee while, but he'd never make any comment about any of it.
Seemed pretty rude to me.
I just watched whatever Karen did, and listened to how she talked to him and then,
after a while I started to copy that, and tell him a few things,
not really bothered about whether he responded or said anything back or not.
I think the first time I spoke to him we were sitting up on the mezzanine and I said that I would tell him about me and wee Karen,
and how it was that we'd come to be living there.
I thought he probably liked the fact that we were living there because he came round so much,
so I thought he might want to know how it was that it came about.
We did it all over backwards, I told him.
First of all we got to know each other, and then a while after that we met,
and when we'd known each other for about seven years we decided to have an anniversary,
and that went quite well, so after the anniversary we had a honeymoon, and that went well too,
so after that we decided that we would get married.
That's why we're living there now. I used to think my dad was Elvis, but I haven't told him that yet.
I haven't told my dad either...


I'm in a mess, I'm in a dress
There's nothing from here till tomorrow morning
How will I get there?
I don't do drugs
All my friends are on their holidays

I go outside, it's not so bad
I saw my friend and he couldn't believe that
The girls were holding hands
The girls are holding hands
Don't be a fool
It's 1995, the girls are just friends

They got the drugs I could use but then I don't need any
All that I want is a photograph of Photo Jenny
How will I get one? I don't know
How will I get one? I don't know
How will I get her to strike a pose?

It's getting cold, I'll catch the bus
I saw my friend when she's finished working
Get some fish and chips
What's on the box?
'Man about the house' with Paula Wilcox

You see the boy/girl's at the bar
Everyone thinks she's really ugly
But I shut my eyes
And the star of it is Photo Jenny


There are people going hungry far away
They've got nothing on their plates
And you're filling your fat face with every different kind of cake
And if you ever go lardy, or go lame
I will drop you straight away
That's the price you have to pay
For every stupid thing you say

There are people going lonely, and they'll stay
Lonely fay into the year
Because you're making blinkers fashionable
And fashionably you'll say
"All is equal in love and war" and
"I'm sorry, but I've got some things to do"
And you pretend to read a book you'll never finish till the day

That the author dedicates it
To A Century Of Fakers
They took your mould and they burned it on the fire in history today
Yeah, the author dedicates it
To A Century Of Fakers
He was an anarchist, he tried his best but it wasn't good enough

Did I say I would see you soon?
Well I'm sorry, but i just came off my bike
And my face is scarred
And chance has barred me seeing you tonight
I was over the other side of the city
And if the truth be known I'd say
That you look great from there before you shaved your golden hair today

Everybody's trying to make us
Another century of fakers
They took you mould and burned it on the fire of history today
Everybody's trying to make us
Another cool decade of fakers
Another century of fakers


Sunbeam shone, mousy girl on the end pew
You'd stay home, oh if only they let you
Le Pastie de la Bourgeoisie

Municipal pool, you're a junior life saver
But you're friends are all serious ravers
Le Pastie de la Bourgeoisie
Reading Judy Blume
But you came too soon

You're too tall, much too tall for a boyfriend
They run and hide, from your buck tooth and split ends
Don't be scared, like the books you've read
You're the heroine
You'll be doing fine

Wouldn't you like to get away?
Bestowing the memory of good and evil
On the ones you left behind
The heartless swine

And you love like nobody around you 
How you love, and a halo surrounds you
Le Pastie de la Bourgeoisie
In the Autumn cool
Say cheerio to school

Listen Dear, I've been watching you lately
If I said all these things you would hate me
Le Pastie de la Bourgeoisie
At the church bazaar
I nearly went too far

Wouldn't you like to get away?
Give yourself up to the allure of
Catcher In The Rye
The future's swathed in Stars and Stripes

Wouldn't you like to get away?
Kerouac's beckoning with open arms,
And open roads of eucalyptus
Westward bound


She lay in bed all night watching the colours change
She lay in bed all night watching the morning change
She lay in bed all night watching the morning change into green and gold

The doctor told her years ago that she was ill
The doctor told her years ago to take a pill
The doctor told her years ago that she'd go blind if she wasn't careful

They let Lisa go blind
The world was at her feet and she was looking down
They let Lisa go blind
And everyone she knew thought she was beautiful
Only slightly mental
Beautiful, only temperamental
Beautiful, only slightly mental
Beautiful

She thought it would be fun to try photography
She thought it would be fun to try pornography
She thought it would be fun to try most anything
She was tired of sleeping

They let Lisa go blind, let Lisa go blind, let Lisa go blind
They let Lisa go blind
She's looking like a queen
But if you knew what's going on in her life
There'd be a thousand barren mothers there to talk to her
If you knew what's going on in her life
There'd be two hundred troubled teenagers to sit with her
And to talk to her
If you knew what's going on in her life
What's going on in her life
There would be a documentary on Radio 4

She made herself a pair of orthopaedic shoes
She thought it was the answer to the fashion blues
She thought it was the answer to the fashion blues
But she walked with a limp 

They let Lisa go blind, let Lisa go blind, let Lisa go blind [repeated]


Sebastian you're in a mess
You had a dream, they called you king
Of all the hipsters, is it true?
Or are you still the queen?

Like getting blood out of a stone
The city left you all alone
You came to dance, but there's no poignancy
When they all leave you standing alone

The wider issues of the day
Don't interest you, you'll have to pay
For looking at the floor
When people talk to you

You wrote a book about yourself
The people left it on the shelf
You'll write another one
Now you've got a story that's worth talking about

Are you happy with yourself?
Are you talking to yourself?
Are you happy with yourself?
Put the book back on the shelf

I know the company you keep
You're on the sofa hidden deep
While on the telly Sid James speaks
To you like God

You're always looking for a sign
But boy you blow it every time
You hear a voice begin to speak
You ignore it and go softly to sleep


Emma tried to run away,
I followed her across the city,
She went out to the Easterhouse,
Because she liked the sound of it.

She didn't have a single penny,
She stuck a finger in the air,
She tried to flag down an aeroplane,
I suppose she needs a holiday.

I put my arm around her waist,
She put me on the ground with Judo,
She didn't recognise my face,
She wasn't even looking.

Laura's feeling just ideal,
Her horoscope was nearly perfect,
She's thinking of something to do,
Because she is The Birthday Girl.

She walked out to the edge of town,
She saw me lying in the park,
She took Emma by the hand,
They've got a lot in common.

I'll leave them to do what they want,
I'll leave them to do what they need to,
I'll go and play with words and pictures,
I'll admit I'm feeling strange.

[instrumental]

I'm not as sad as Doestoevsky,
I'm not as clever as Mark Twain,
I'll only buy a book for the way it looks,
And then I stick it on the shelf again.

Now I could tell you what I'm thinking,
But it never seems to do you good,
It's beyond me what a girl can see,
I'm only lucid when I'm writing songs.

This is just a modern rock song,
This is just a sorry lament,
We're four boys in corduroys,
We're not terrific but we're competent.

Stevie's full of good intentions,
Richards into rock 'n' roll,
Stuart's staying in and he thinks it's a sin,
That he has to leave the house at all.

[instrumental]

This is just a modern rock song,
This is just a tender affair,
I count "three, four" and then we start to slow,
Because a song has got to stop somewhere.


I know where the summer goes
When you're having no fun
When you're under the thumb
I know where the summer dwells
If your underarm smells
And your kitchen looks like hell

I know where the summer goes
If you're scraping a pot, and your head is hot
Put your head down, put your thumbs up girl
With the smell of hot desk
And the glitter of your step
He was right, he's the upcoming guru of the city
No one told the city councillors

I know, you can tell me again
I've got my mobile phone
Full of silicon chips
No one likes a smart arse
But I've seen a pattern emerge
I will race you up the hill
Where the boy who made records out of postcard messages
And flowering cherries rain on kids like you

Look twice at the kid with the crimped
And overheated hair
They ran a book on his looks
Odds on was the noble pose and
The denim hard riff of the Irish Troubadour
But the boy came from nowhere to
Steal the hearts of lassies in the lavvies of the club tonight


In the hope I'll forget I'll wait
It's a chance I'll take oh yeah
In the hope I'll forget I'll wait
For the time

In the spring I'll watch my step
While the night-time passes by
When a smile suits me all alone
I'll be fine

There's got to be a better song to sing
Before I hang upon your shoulder
Telling the truth it may be bolder this time
There's got to be a better song to sing
That makes a lonely one less cold oh
Before I hang upon your shoulder and cry

Watching friends playing in the dirt
Feeling hard but feeling hurt
By the sadness that wastes my time
It's a crime

Counting acts which I must add
To collect sad memories
From a past I'd soon forget
Swap or leave

There's got to be a better song to sing
Before I hang upon your shoulder
Telling the truth it may be bolder this time
There's got to be a better song to sing
That makes a lonely one less cold oh

Before I hang upon your shoulder and cry
At the gate I'll wave goodbye
To the friends that were my lies
And I'll see them off at dawn
Feeling wise
Feeling wise
Feeling wise


There's a portrait
In a back room,
Which I keep for days upon, which I relent
And gaze for hours on the muscle skin and bone of some 
Imaginary friend. 

So how about it? 
Show me please how I will look in twenty years
And let me please,
Interpret history in every line and scar that's painted 
There in front of me.

It doesn't matter what I'm thinking
What I tell myself to do
I'll end up calling.

I stay in to defrost the fridge
Now the kid has gone to bed
A feeling of dread.
At least when she's around the troubles there,
It's worse to wake up with her falling round the room.

Listen Johnny; you're like a mother
To the girl you've fallen for, 
And you're still falling.

Listen Johnny;
You're like a mother to the girl you've fallen for,
And you're still falling,
And if they come tonight
You'll roll up tight and take whatever's coming to you next.


L-O-V-E love, it's coming back, it's coming back
L-O-V-E love, it's coming back, it's coming back

Refer to our discussions, confirm the terms of our love affair
I exercise all options, and I know I'll see you there

BA-BA-BA etc. etc.

L-O-V-E love, it's coming back, it's coming back
L-O-V-E love, it's coming back, it's coming back

Not withstanding provisions of clauses 1,2,3 and 4
Extend contractual period, me and you for evermore

You're the Legal Man, you've got to prove that you're no liar
I'll render services that you may reasonably require

L-O-V-E love, it's coming back, it's coming back
L-O-V-E love, it's coming back, it's coming back

Get out of the city and into the sunshine
Get out of the office and into the springtime
Get out of the city and into the sunshine
Get out of the office and into the springtime
Get out of the city and into the sunshine
Get out of the office and into the springtime
Get out of the city and into the sunshine
Get out of the office and into the springtime


Who's that girl?
She must be nearly freezing
Who's that girl out there
All that snow makes it hard so see her
Did she wave to me 

And maybe I'm in love
Love love, love love
And maybe that's enough
That stuff, that stuff

Made a film
I made it through the window
Who's that star I cast?
All wrapped up in her winter wardrobe
She hurries by so fast

And maybe I'm in love
Love love, love love
And maybe that's enough
That stuff, that stuff

On summer days when the sun shines
I watch the tape
And through the snow, through the window
I watch her wave to me

Who's that girl?
She must be nearly freezing


I know you like her
Well I like her too
I know she likes you
It's not as if I'm being sent off to War
There are worse things in this world

There's still room on my wooden horse for two
I was Jonathan to your David
You're still King

Well, I'd thought about her
I dreamed she'd come, I'd make my escape
I thought she liked me but somehow I was wrong
I know you don't want it this way
But it's O.K.

It's not like we'll be parted
It's not like we never know love

And she'll smile for you
She'll hold your hand
You'll be in love there's no other way
And I will make it some day

I know you like her
Well I like her too
I know she likes you
It's not as if I'm being sent off to War
There are worse things in this world

There's still room on my wooden horse for two
I was Jonathan to your David
You're still King

Visions of love recollected
Have we ever been true?
I know that I have, it's time for you to go
It's all in the stones that you throw
I want you to know

It's not like we'll be parted
It's not like we never know love

And she'll smile for you
She'll hold your hand
You'll be in love there's no other way

People say that
"We'll never change"
"We'll never change"
But I have

You and her in the local newspaper
You will be Married and you'll be gone

Married and you'll be gone


In the board room the quiet man takes a
Second to think what to do
He's out of his seat and he's starting to speak
And he hears his own voice
For years and years he's done nothing but bow down and put up with all their demands
She sits like a viper and offers the clock
Without giving a damn
He takes it

"Honour forbids me but honour be damned
You have whined till you got what you want
I did the work and when things were going badly
You left us to rot"

He locked the door or the boardroom
And turned like the scene from the old country song
Towering over the table he's lost
He is drunk with it all

"You only
Came back to us when we'd turned it around
When we'd rescued your arse from the fire
Your contribution to all that we did was to say 
it was dire"

"Night after day after night I've been working
Despite of you fucking us all
Now I'm going to die I don't care if you cry
Just please leave me alone
And spare your tears from yourself
We've had those till we're sick
You should leave while you still have the chance"

The others were shocked at this shameless disgrace
At the end of an honoured career
He paused in the silence to pull down his tie
And observe the melee


I'll take a second of the day to think about the things that we have Done this year
The dog lies down, the pouring rain
I'm underneath the smoker's railway arch again
The future's looking colourful
It's the colour of blood, chaos and corruption of a happy soul
A happy soul will
Ride in the field
Till the rain dies down

The railway ticket states a destination
But it doesn't mean that we will show
There's a fork upon the line
We paid the guard to switch the sign, and off we go
The future's looking wonderful
It's the wonder of a businessman's conspiracy to sell your wares
And no one cares
Oh you care, I know
You care, I forgot for a while

On a sulky afternoon spent in dispute
You'll give yourself a headache, boy
So I take revenge in stories and dreaming of the time when
We're on stage
"Have you seen The Loneliness Of A Middle Distance Runner?"
When he stops the race and looks around
I left the stage
"You've seen it now"
I walked to the station
I wish you follow me tonight


I need someone to take some joy in something I do
You need a man who's either rich or losing a screw
You know I love you here's the irony
You're going to walk away intact
I think you never liked me anyway
You like yourself and you like
Men to kiss your arse
Expensive clothes
Please stop me there
I think I'm waking up to us
We're a disaster
You don't want to know me
'Cause you move in circles of the brave
Where art defines their lives

She was the one love of my life, and I let her go
And if I look like death today
then please let her know
I never wanted to do harm to her
I only wanted her to see
The beauty of the world surrounding her
But when she opened up her eyes
It's much too late
Our chance has gone
She's with a guy
Who takes the prize for everything I ever showed her
Digging all the fun
Because she's older
I fed her with a spoon
I made her mother smile
I helped the kid survive

She was the one love of my life,
she showed me the road
I loved her dog, her steady gaze, the chapter is closed
I always wanted all the best for her
The best thing was to stay away
She grew up and she left the rest of us
And now the understanding's gone
I haven't changed, how could I?
I'm pretty much the same person
I cannot keep the anger hidden anymore
But lucky for you, you are not around
My anger turns to pity and to love
The season has arrived


I love my car 
I'll admit today I've gone too far
To enamour myself of my little motor car
I love my dog
I love my pussy cat, I love the rat
That lives under the floor and makes his bed from novelettes

I wish I could say the same for you
The day will come soon when I look in your eyes but
I won't see you

I've got a head like a soaking sponge
I've got a tongue like a little slug
I won't be bugged by trivia

I love my Carl
I love my Brian my Dennis and my Al
I could even find it in my heart to love Mike Love

I wish I could say the same for you
The day will come soon when I look in your eyes to
see you smiling


There's misery in all I hear and see
From the people on TV
After their tea when life begins again
They'll be happier than me
There are a thousand meals being made on Saturday
From the view I saw today
I took a bet inside the launderette
With a girl from Wallasey

She spoke in dialect I could not understand
But one thing she made clear
There was no coming on to her
There was no way

[Instrumental]

There's misery in all I hear and see

There are a thousand meals being made on Saturday

I took a bet inside the launderette
With a girl from Wallasey

She spoke in dialect I could not understand
But one thing she made clear
There was no coming on to her
There was no way
That she could respect
If it couldn't see
That the girl just wants to be
Left alone with Marx and Engels for a while
She's writing in the style
Of any riot girl

"The bourgeoisie, historically, has played a revolutionary part to all feudal, idyllic relationships.
It has resolved personal worth and in place of freedom is exploitation for profit alone.
There is a spectre of the past in my bold assertion.
We could learn much from the past."


Morning prayers took the girl unawares
She was late for class and she knew it
The broadcaster had a voice that was soothing
She couldn't tell if it was a man or woman
A patch of sun fell onto her neck
She put her head on her arms on her desk

The lesson today was Acts of Apostles
The crazy hippies, they're running scared
She shut her eyes and imagined the desert
No cars, no mobiles, just sun and bread 
What would she look like standing by the well?
More like a women and less like a girl

'Oh, if I could make sense of it all!
I wish that I could sing
I'd stay in a melody
I would float along in my everlasting song
What would I do to believe?'

Later on she plays Morning Has Broken
She knows she's bad
She is slowing everbody down
The choirmaster, usually a bastard, knows her mother's sick
He'll be nice to her
She thinks that she shouldn't be there at all
Her worries make everything else seem trivial

'Oh, if I could make sense of it all!
I wish that I could sing
I'd stay in a melody
I would float along in my everlasting song
What would I do to believe?'


Another sunny day, I met you up in the garden
You were digging plants, I dug you, beg your pardon
I took a photograph of you in the herbaceous border
It broke the heart of men and flowers and girls and trees

Another rainy day, we're trapped inside with a train set
Chocolate on the boil, steamy windows when we met
You've got the attic window looking out on the cathedral 
And on a Sunday evening bells ring out in the dusk 

Another day in June, we'll pick eleven for football
We're playing for our lives the referee gives us fuck all
I saw you in the corner of my eye on the sidelines
Your dark mascara bids me to historical deeds

Everybody's gone you picked me up for a long drive
We take the tourist route the nights are light until midnight
We took the evening ferry over to the peninsula
We found the avenue of trees went up to the hill
That crazy avenue of trees, I'm living there still

There's something in my eye a little midge so beguiling
Sacrificed his life to bring us both eye to eye
I heard the Eskimos remove obstructions with tongues, dear
You missed my eye, I wonder why, I didn't complain
You missed my eye, I wonder why, please do it again

'The lovin is a mess what happened to all of the feeling'
I thought it was for real; babies, rings and fools kneeling
And words of pledging trust and lifetimes stretching forever
So what went wrong? It was a lie, it crumbled apart
Ghost figures of past, present, future haunting the heart


You're a white collar boy and you gave into the law
Give in to the pressure the cops gonna getcha
You were a thieving dog at work until they caught your little paw
Your wage won't stretch, to picking up checks
A custodial sentence you narrowly avoided
Community service you had to go along with 
You're banging the rocks at the old city docks
Poor boy poor boy poor boy poor boy

You were chained to a girl that would kill you with a look
It's a nice way to die she's so easy on the eye
She said let's get away, but you played it by the book
You're a warden's pet, she's a screaming suffragette
'We ain't in prison, we'll just finish up and go home'
She said, 'Not for me, I've got plans for later on'
So she belted the sarge and she jumped on a barge
You fell, you fell you fell you fell

White collar, got dirt in your pants
You got egg in your hair
You got spit in your chin
White collar, scared to be bored
Blue Collar, she's opening doors
White collar boy, on the run from the law

She said 'You ain't ugly, you can kiss me if you like'
Go ahead and kiss her, you don't know what you're missing
You said 'Baby, you're special, 
But there's something not quite right.'
She's a Venus in flares and you wanna split hairs!
'I am innocent, you are a rocket. 
Things were ok till you took out the copper'
Leave me alone, and get used to the chains
You're a pain, a pain, a pain, a pain

White collar, got dirt in your pants
You got egg in your hair
You got spit in your chin
White collar, scared to be bored
Blue Collar, she's opening doors
White collar boy, on the run from the law


Look at the kid from school
He's teaching mamas and papas how to be a little cool
He's changing fashion, the way he dress
The tracksuits are old, and the hoody's way too moody
For a kid with the will to funk
He dances in secret; he's a part-time punk

She's getting off the plane
She wants to write a thesis on the population underprivileged
The kids fighting up the lane
Shop lifting, just drifting
Like The Switchblade And The Cross 
But if there's trouble she's got the moves
She's taking an elementary class in Kung fu

I left my washing in the launderette
You can put some money on it, you can place a little bet
That when I see my washing 
The black will be grey and the white will be grey
But the blues are still blue

I'm crying out for my mum
If the malady don't go away we're in a little trouble
With the boss of the company
I'm a singer, a swinger I'm a layabout but laying on 
The dock in the lazy sun
Will never quite relegate me to a bum

I left my lady in the launderette
You can put some money on it, you can place a little bet
That when I see my lady
The black will be white and the white will be black
But The Blues Are Still Blue

Baby, I love your face
I've been creeping round this town because?
Well, creeping's just my way
But with a little wink I'll be there
I'll be excited for a week, but then excitement starts to fade
I know your young, but you're out of touch
You're French, your vocabulary's not quite formed

I left my homework in the launderette
I got a letter from my mamma which my stoopid dog has ate
I hid behind the fence
Here comes the deputy head with the bark of a bulldog
He's not making much sense

I left my lady in the launderette
You can put some money on it, you can place a little bet
That when I see my lady
The black will be white and the white will be black
But the blues are still blue?


I'm the singer, I'm the singer in the band
You're the loser, I won't dismiss you out of hand
Cos you've got a beautiful face
It will take you places

You kept running
You've got money, you've got fame
Every morning I see your picture from the train
Now you're an actress!
So says your r'sum?
You're made of card
You couldn't act your way out of a paper bag

You got lucky, you ain't talking to me now
Little Miss Plucky
Pluck your eyebrows for the crowd
Get on the airplane
You give me stomach pain
I wish that you were here
We would have had a lot to talk about

We had a deal there
We nearly signed it with our blood?
An understanding
I thought that you would keep your word
I'm disappointed
I'm aggravated
It's a fault I have, I know
When things don't go my way I have to 

Blow up in the face of my rivals
I swear and I rant, I make quite an arrival
The men are surprised by the language
They act so discreet, they are hypocrites so fuck them too!

I always loved you
You always had a lot of style
I'd hate to see you on the pile
Of 'nearly-made-it' s
You've got the essence, dear
If I could have a second skin
I'd probably dress up in you

You're a star now, I am fixing people's nails
I'm knitting jumpers, I'm working after hours
I've got a boyfriend, I've got a feeling that he's seeing someone else
He always had thing for you as well

Blow in the face of my rivals
I swear and I rant, I make quite an arrival
The men are surprised by the language
They act so discreet, they are hypocrites forget them
So fuck them too!


Sukie was the kid, she liked to hangout in the graveyard
She did brass rubbings, she learned you never had to press hard
When she finished hanging out she was all alone
She decided that she better check in at home
There was an awful row between her mum and dad
They said she hadn't done this, she hadn't done that
If she wanted to remain inside the family home
She'd have to tow the line, she'd have to give it a go
It didn't suit Sukie
So she took her things and left 

Sukie was the kid, she liked to hang out at the art school
She didn't enrol, but she wiped the floor with all the arseholes
She took a bijou flat with the fraternity cat
She hid inside the attic of the sculpture building
She had a slut slave and his name was Dave
She said 'Be my photo bitch and I'll make you rich'
He didn't believe her but the boy revered her
He got her meals and he got her a bed
He watched behind the screen and she started to undress
He never got far 
Just lookin' and playing guitar

Autumn hanging down all the trees are draped like chandeliers
Sukie saw the beauty but she wasn't wet behind the ears
She had an A1 body and a face to match
She didn't have money, she didn't have cash
With the winter coming on, and the attic cold
She had to press her nose on the refectory wall
They served steamed puddings she went without
She had to pose for life for all the scholars of art
She didn't feel funny, she didn't feel bad
Peeling away everything she had
She had the grace of an eel, sleek and stark
As the shadows played tricks on the girl in the dark

Sukie was the kid, she liked to hangout in the graveyard


Tired like the beggar with the cold inside his bones
Looking for the pleasure that he knew was so far gone
So far gone
I took a turn to myself
And I was surprised, cause I saw everyone who ever I had loved
I felt a whole lot better after that

People look at us and they think were doing fine
People look at us cause they see us all the time
All the time
But they never take to us
We've been in this town so long we may as well be dead
So long as people turn their heads
And cross the street whenever we walk on by

Someone told the truth when it really mattered most
The beauty of the moment is the beauty sadly lost
Sadly lost
So I went around to your house
Over tea and gin we talked about the things we read
In Luke and John the things he said
And now it's morning we are the sleepyheads


Honey'd sweet apples, they're rotting away
Millions of people never start in the race
There's stuff on out plates that has not been alive
Someone pays full price for my cheap flight life

'Sunshine, we all see the same sky'

I am a man filled with longing desire
The gifts of creation are ready for hire
A look and a label are all I require
Enough's not enough, I never ask why

'Sunshine, we all see the same sky
Looking, learning, asking the same 'why?''

Honey'd sweet apples, they're rotting away
Millions of people never start in the race
There's stuff on out plates that has not been alive
Someone else pays the real price of my cheap flight life

Wheel of fortune spins,
But the wheels on fire come crashing on you
Honey'd sweet apples, they're rotting away

'Sunshine, we all see the same sky
Looking, learning, asking the same 'why?'
Sunshine, we all see the same sky'


Honey lovin you is the greatest thing
I get to be myself and I get to sing 
I get to play at being irresponsible
I come home late at night and I love your soul
I never forget you in my prayers
I never have a bad thing to report

You're my picture on the wall
You're my vision in the hall
You're the one I'm talking to
When I get in from my work
You are my girl, and you don't even know it
I am livin out the life of a poet
I am the jester in the ancient court
You're the funny little frog in my throat

My eye sight's fading, my hearing's dim
I can't get insured for the state I'm in
I'm a danger to myself I've been starting fights
At the party at the club on a Saturday night
But I don't get disapproving from my girl
She gets the all highlights wrapped in pearls..

You're my picture on the wall
You're my vision in the hall
You're the one I'm talking to
When I get in from my work
You are my girl, and you don't even know it
I am livin out the life of a poet
I am the jester in the ancient court
You're the funny little frog in my throat

I had a conversation with you at night
It's a little one sided but that's allright
I tell you in the kitchen about my day
You sit on the bed in the dark changing places
With the ghost that was there before you came
You've come to save my life again

I don't dare to touch your hand 
I don't dare to think of you
In a physical way
And I don't know how you smell
You are the cover of my magazine
You're my fashion tip, a living museum
I'd pay to visit you on rainy Sundays
I'll maybe tell you all about it someday


Well my heart has fallen down
Thought I'd talked myself around
But to be myself completely I've just got to let you down

Well I knew I'd say goodbye
Though it's not my time to cry
And forever and for no one I will let it all go by
And to be myself completely I've just got to say goodbye
Z-list star in a hundred grand garrett
The ladies say 'Hey baby, you've earned it!'
I'm not so sure, I toured the land 
You could call it work if you count the band
Still your voice calls out to me 
Escort me to the harmony 
I'm not sure what I will be
Find me in a bitter sweet hello

Well my heart has fallen down
Thought I'd talked myself around
Though we say goodbye and wonder 
What's to know and who's to blame
But to be myself completely I will love you just the same


I'm bored out my mind
Too sick to even care
I'll take a little walk
Nobody's going to know
I'm in senior year
It gives you a little free time
I'll just use it all at once!

Took the fence and the lane
The bus then the train
Bought an 'Independent' to make me look like I got brains
I made a story up in my head if anybody would ask
I'm going to a seminar!

I'm a genius
A prodigy
A demon at Maths and Science
I'm up for a prize
If you gotta grow up sometime
You've to do it on your own
I don't think I could stand to be stuck
That's the way that things were going

The bible's my tool
There's no mention of school!
My Damascan Road's my transistor radio
I tune in at night when my mum and my dad start to fight
I put on my headphones
And I tune out
I am devout
The girls are singing about my life
But they're not here, they've got the wild life

If you want to find out, find out
You got to look them in the eye
That's why my only choice
Is find the face behind the voice?.

She asked the man if the service was open
'Not today, just the choir from the radio'
'Couldn't I sit in? I've come all this way'
'Will you bugger off, I've got work to do.'

The city was losing its appeal
God was asleep
He was back in her village, in the fields

'Oh, if I could make sense of it all!
I wish that I could sing
I'd stay in a melody
I would float along in my everlasting song
What would I do to believe?'


For the price of a cup of tea
You'd get a line of coke
For the price of a night with me
You'd be the village joke
For the price of a pint of milk
I'll tell you all I know
About the state of the world today
Sit down, enjoy the show

She had several hours to find a place to stay
Try the coffee shop, but somewhere on the way
She heard about a place, somewhere she could go 
Walked a couple of blocks to her destination

For the price of a cup of tea
You'd get a seven inches
Soul black vinyl to stop your tears
You can use my stereo? 
You might be the village joke but 
Don't listen to the gossip of the other folk

She just wants to be accepted in this place 
There's something in her face
She will always seem exotic and aloof
If you want to know the truth
Her friend the stars dripping from the jewelled sky
When she was passing by
Would keep her calm 
There was people that she knew, at least she thought she did
Be easy on the kid!

She took her winter coat from her plastic wrapper
Pushed back her fringe, see her birthmark
She can finally be the person she wanted to be


Mornington Crescent
I think of you
Rain in the southeast
Men feeling blue
Men with their bowlers
Kids with their spats
Ladies with chauffeurs
Dogs wearing hats and jackets
Rich apartments
Old punk posters
Tartan garments
I love the exquisite array
I love the camp as camp parade
The possibilities suggest themselves to me
I'm feeling free

Mornington Crescent
The sun in the east
I've got a job on 
For a Senegalese rich arbitrator
In African law
To paint his apartment, strip down the walls
Came down between us lately
Lust and want and need just caved in
'Is it wise?'
The answer's no
It never is but since you ask
We pause thoughtfully, for twenty seconds reprieve
Then it's off with the briefs

Mornington Crescent
Sin is my game
We'll all be lined up
Irrelevant fame
Next to the broker, the nurse and the drunk
I was a joker, the wannabe punk that got lucky
Had a good time
Life became fruitless
Egotistic swine to all your friends
All the ladies and the men
The possibilities suggest themselves to me
We're a little too free


Make me dance, I want to surrender
Your familiar arms, I remember
We've been going transcontinental
Got no car, we just take a rental

But we don't have the money
(money makes the wheels and the world go round)
Forget about it, honey

Make me dance, I want to surrender
Your familiar arms, I remember
Everybody's talking about you
Every word's a whisper without you

But we don't have the money
(money makes the wheels and the world go round)
Forget about it, honey
Trouble's never far away when you're around

I didn't see it coming
I'm just not in the running

Take me on a train 'cos I'm not flying
I can see the world from a different side
Read about us in the morning papers
When we make it alive

I didn't see it coming
I'm just not in the running

And we don't need a lifetime
We're following the right line


Six in the morning
The men started working
I can't sleep
No, I can't sleep
I keep feeling the lights
So I think I should get up and call you
Going to find you

And it's fun
Thinking of you like a movie star
And it's dumb
Thinking of you like the way that you were

Everyone loves you
The boy in the corner
The postman
The policeman
It does me no good 
To keep looking ahead at your future
Adoration

And it's fun
Thinking of you like a movie star
And it's dumb
Thinking of you like the way that you were

Every moment like a sudden pleasure
Every moment that will get you by
And it's going to cause a crisis
Might just lose a little faith

I've seen all kinds of strangers
The rich and the famous
They don't count
No, they don't count
Now I'm back on my beat
On the same greasy street
There's an angel on my shoulder
Saying, "Ho, have you ever said an honest word?"
Saying, "Yo, have you ever said a pretty word?"

Every moment like a sudden pleasure
Every moment that will get you by
And it's going to cause a crisis
Might just lose a little faith
Don't touch me
If you touch me you could never go back

Faith

Come on, sister have a drink
Have a seat at the bar
Tell me all about your men
And your hopes 
And the hours of your life

You could love
After all that's what you're looking for
You can love
It's a currency unspoken of

But it's hard to form a good opinion
Yet you're going to look at me that way
And it's going to cause a crisis
Might just lose a little faith
Don't touch me
If you touch me you can never go back

Faith

Come on, sister have a drink
Have a seat at the bar
Tell me all about your men
And your hopes 
And the hours of your life


A lack of understanding
You took for being lazy
I was just being lazy
I'm even doing it now

I know that you have saved me
I love that you have saved me

Save your pennies careful
Let both blue eyes be watchful
It's best to forget freedom
It's best to be enslaved

It's better still to love first
It's harder still to love first

You're my winter queen that disappeared
Your hands grew cold
You ran a mile from my wings(?)
I still heard you had a full-flown view
With lots of time
And notebook full of the finest creamy, rich-girl parchment pages 
Slowly filled with all your passing days
Every sacred word paints a picture

Bigger were his muscles
? his ?
But when you are in trouble
And when you are uptight

I get the midnight phone call
I'm your captain for the long haul 

If someone else is near me
You scuttle up the pavement
It's no one that I care for
I pause for an effect
You calculating bimbo
I wish you'd let the past go


I want the world to stop (I want the world to stop)
Give me the morning (give me the understanding)
I want the world to stop (I want the world to stop)
Give me the morning, give me the afternoon
The night, the night

Let me step out of my shell
I'm wrapped in sheets of milky winter disorder
Let me feel the air again, the talk of friends
The mind of someone my equal

I want the world to stop…

Tinseltown has followed me from Tinseltown to
Grey adorable city by the docks
Girls will walk in moving air the sun hangs low the girls don’t care
As they paint themselves at dusk.

I want the world to stop…

Towns’ and cities’ populations up and grow
The workers move to the suburbs
In between I watch and go
I run along side rush hour traffic a prayer for every car

I want the world to stop…

I want to write a message to you
Everyday at 10 o clock in the evening
Yellow pearl my city is
This is your art this is your Balzac your Brookside and your Bach


[Stuart:]
What a waste, I could've been your lover
What a waste, I could've been your friend
Perfect love is like a blossom that fades so quick
When it's blowing up a storm in May

Travel south until your skin turns warmer
Travel south until your skin turns brown
Put a language in your head and get on a train
And then come back to the one you love

[Norah:]
Yeah you're great, you're just part of this lifetime of dreaming
That extends to the heart of this long summer feeling

Quiet night, you see the tv's glowing
Quiet night, you hear the walls are awake
Being you I'm getting out of a party crowd
Can I see what's underneath your bed?

Can I stay until the milkman's working?
Can I stay until the café awakes?

[Together:]
Do you hate me in the light?
Did you get a fright?
When you looked across from where you lay

Yeah you're great, you're just part of this lifetime of dreaming
That extends to the heart of this long summer feeling
All the history of wars I invent in my head
Little Lou, Ugly Jack, Prophet John
All the history of wars I invent in my head
Little Lou, Ugly Jack, Prophet John

[Stuart:]
What a waste, I could've been your lover

[Norah:]
What a waste, I could've been your friend


I know a spell
That would make you well
Write about love
It can be in any tense
But it must make sense

I know a trick
Forget that you are sick
Write about love
It can be in any form
Hand it to me in the morning

[Chorus:]
I hate my job, I'm working way too much (every day I'm stuck in an office)
At one o'clock, I take my lunch up on the roof
The city spread below
I write about a man
He's intellectual and he's hot, but he understands

The seconds move on (if you watch the clock)
And the sky grows dull (if you're looking up)
And the girls move from thrill to thrill on the tightrope walk (on the tightrope walk)

[Chorus]

I know the way (so you know the way)
Get on your skinny knees and pray (Maybe not today)
You've got to see the dream through the windows and the trees of your living room (of your living room)
You've got to see the dream through the windows and the trees of your living room


Born on a Sunday, everyday is Monday
That is what I've heard
About the real world
Up on the morning, 
Heading for the schoolyard
Big boys being bullies make it so hard?

It's a lesson for the real world
Seems so far away the real world

Up to the bigger school
Trying not to be foot
Hear I am new shoes and cagoule
Look I'm getting closer to the real world
("Tell me where the girls are?")

Thinking about happiness
Thinking about Tara
Thinking about sorrow
Thinking about Sara
Sorrow and Sara are the very same word

In my young life I get so hurt
Will I make it in the real world?

Gluing up my Airfix kit
Cigarettes after gym
Had a pint of Special Brew
Won't do that again

Train for examination, got me traction.
Mickey mouse college course,
Looking for action
Play guitar, stacking shelves
Holding back in the real world

Now it's Monday morning,
I'm still yawning
Scuffing down the city street
Heading for the clock on
Bought a 'Daily Record' like a real man

Well I made it to the real world
But I'm not living in the real world


I've seen God in the sun
I've seen God in the street
God before bed and the promise of sleep
God in my dreams and the free ride of grace
But it all disappears
And then I wake up

Was it too late?
Was it just your fate?
There's a demon that waits at the garden gate
If you get past him maybe Lawrence and Phil
Will be waiting to take you to the ghost of rockschool

Everything hums
As the blue heart turns
And the blue girls dawn us when the sun goes down
A story tonight is from your solitude heights
I got a window on your constellation

Master I love from the ground above
There's the stars below as my memory flows
Every picture frame is beating louder than time
Every clock in the hall is bending slowly

She's in her tower
And she's beautiful, sure
The quicker you learn she has no soul to discern
At least no business of yours
You bear the vacuum of scars
She was put there to tempt you
Like the perfume of flowers

I've seen God in the sun
I've seen God in the street
God before bed and the promise of sleep
God in my dreams and the free ride of grace
I've seen God shining up from her reflection 

I've seen God in the sun
I've seen God in the street
God before bed and the promise of sleep
God in the puddles and the (?)
I've seen God shining up from her reflection


Love and pain and sorrow keep the band together
She was like my soul mate
Whispered in my ear
Love was playing music
It was all we wanted
Making plastic records of our history

How I knew it mattered
To a certain person
Heard the boy in London call out from the crowd
Said something that I .. to me 10 years later
Wishing that he still called
Like he called that night

Pulling songs from thin air
Pulling songs from bridges
Smell the air in small town

Where the train line stops
Ever will I love you
Now your chapter's over
Ever will I love you
You were good to me

Now our pain and memory
is a cherished story
Moan about the present
Venerate the past
Love is like a novel
Read the blessed pages
Did I do my best dear?
That is all you ask


I saw you around 
When you were young and free 
How did I know 
Try but I can't remember 
How it began (back in the day) 
Was there a plan? (follow my way) 
I'm living in the past 
You're making history 

The road into town 
That's when it came to me 
I'm not alone 
I felt the world stop turning 
Stop in your tracks (where could I go?) 
Cover my back (let yourself show) 
I took the long way home 
I feel a blistering 

Listen up we'll make a deal 
And I'll tell you what I see 

And when the second hand 
Hits the morning 
You will hear me calling 
Come to me, come to me 

Don't leave me behind 
Stuck in a memory 
Caught in a lie 
Something that once you told me 
Fortune or fame 
Please don't be late 
Watching the world will fall in the sand 

Forward's the only way to go 
You catch me up I'll take it slow 
I can see your future, there's nobody around 
[Repeat x6]


There is no hole in which to hide 
There is no plane to catch 
No hope, tell them that's warm enough 
No rent to a room that's quiet 

A friend I've known through six degrees 
Cools down to where I hide 
A friend I've known through dreams and prayers 
She comes back to my side 

You're so far from wanting to talk 
You're so far from wanting to say something good 
Feel something good 

The sea cries of loves of girls 
The sea cries of boys 
The storm, we are the both of us 
Too close to ever love 

Whiskey from the island of Sun 
Whiskey from the year you were born 
Tastes like kidnap and ransom and exile 

Somebody asked me what hell was like 
Somebody asked me for help 
Somebody asked me what hell was like 
Lunging and happening, parting of souls 

Every girl you ever admired 
Every boy you ever desired 
Every love you ever forgot 
Every person that you despised is forgiven


Shyness hanging like a wendy
Bad clothes keep you in the village hall
Sunday nothing for the rest of us
Sunday listen to your spirits soar
Thank you thank you for the holiday
We talk sometimes in a quiet world
Three years taking all the scenery 
Black walls cloudy as a sea of gulls

Let the summer go
Let tomorrow take care of itself
If you believe like you tell me so
Hand in hand your lover will be every sweet and hungry soul

Stage scope falling like a summer end
Trees strip wrap yourself in color brown
Some dead's underneath the capricorn
Bell rings summer need to feeling warm
Mornings must have thought about you
All night reach out with a single call
Not my place to be your confidante
I just thought I'd catch you as you fall

Let the summer go
Let tomorrow take care of itself
If you believe like you tell me so
Hand in hand your lover will be every sweet and hungry soul

Goodness glowing like a firefly
Cheap bones blue eyes of a millionaire


My friend,
She wants,
To be a suicide girl.
I'll take her picture,
For the whole wide world.
I've known her for a long time,
You could say that I'm a fan,
But I always thought that I would be her man.

My friend,
She wants,
To be the girl of suicide.
She wants a number,
For her radical side.
I know that she is special,
I can see what she has got,
But without her gloves and garnered clothes (?)
She will take them to the world,
Exposed, she gives it all away.

My friend,
She sometimes gets anxiety and stress.
She got a man,
From the NHS.
She proclaims a week of sadness!
She's abstained from telling jokes!
The world will see her poor image, (?)
A butterfly to empathy.
I know that I can do it,
I'm in to light, I'm in to shade.
But let's face the facts,
We ain't goin' back,
When she takes off her clothes we'll never be the same again!


Lying on my bed, I was reading French
With the light too bright for my senses
From this hiding place life was way too much
It was loud and rough round the edges

So I faced the wall when an old man called
Out of dreams that I would die there
But a sight unseen, you were pulling strings
You had a different idea

I was like a child, I was light as straw
And my father lifted me up there
Took me to a place where they checked my body
My soul was floating in thin air

I clung to the bed and I clung to the past
I clung to the welcome darkness
But at the end of the night there's a green green light
It's the quiet before the madness

There was a girl that sang like the chime of a bell
And she put out her arm, she touched me when I was in hell
When I was in hell

Someone sang a song and I sang along
Cause I knew the words from my childhood
Intellect, ambition they fell away
And they locked me up for my own good

But I didn't mind, cause the silence was kind
It spoke to me in whispers
There was the sound of the wind and the cold cold dawn 
And the quiet hum of business

Let me dangle awhile in this waiting room
I don't need to go, I don't need to know what you're doing
Know what you're doing

Lying on my side you were half awake 
And your face was tired and crumpled
If I had a camera I'd snap you now 
Cause there's beauty in every stumble

We are out of practice we're out of sight
On the edge of nobody's empire
And if we live by books and we live by hope 
Does that make us targets for gunfire?

Now I look at you, you're a mother of two 
You're a quiet revolution
Marching with the crowd, singing dirty and loud 
For the people's emancipation

Did I do okay, did I pave the way?
Was I strong when you were wanting?
I was tied to the yoke with a decent bloke
Who was stern but never daunting

And he told me to push and he made me feel well
He told to me to leave that vision of hell to the dying
Oh to the dying


Allie, what would you do?
When there's bombs in the middle east, you want to hurt yourself
When there's knives in the city streets, you want to end yourself
When there's fun in your mother's house, you want to cry yourself to sleep

Allie, what would you do?
With your fears, because they're adding one by one
And your mountains are obscured behind the sun
And the person that you could be is crumbling into dust

You're in the mess 'cause you thought
You'd be someone else
'Cause the tricks in your head are a lie
Yeah, the tricks in your head are a lie
Yeah, the tricks in your head are a lie

Allie, hand on your head
And a prayer from the soon-to-be-closing library
And if you looked from here, you would surely see
There's a softness in your heart, there's a poetry to come

You bought that gun 'cause you thought
You'd be someone else
'Cause the tricks in your head are a lie
Yeah, the tricks in your head are a lie
Yeah, the tricks in your head are a lie
You made a list of all your heroes

And you thought about what they went through
Yeah, you thought about what they went through
It's much darker, much harder, than anything that happened to you
Allie, what would you do?

When your seven-year plan happens to someone else
And the people in your life you would happily shelf
When day falls night, you are truly on your own?
You're in this place 'cause you thought

You'd be someone else
But the tricks in your head are a lie
Yeah, the tricks in your head are a lie
Yeah, the tricks in your head are a lie


How did I get here? I heard a rumour
From your girlfriend's sister that you knew me
And you end up dancing closer to me

I know that I broke the rule already
She asked me if I'm single
Going steady
I just drop my head and took a step off into the dark

Standing on the black and white tiles
Don't dance on the lines
Cause the bears eat the pretty ones
We are like the islands, divided

Jump to the beat of a party line
Jump to the beat of a party line
There is nobody here
But your body, dear
Jump to the beat of the party line

Stay
You stay

I am on this morning quite distracted
The tug of war begins on our emotion
I am leaving many people feeling 
Worse than before

People like to drive their cars and smoke up
People like to sit inside and toke up
People like to shoot at things with borrowed guns and knives

I am happy to look and run
Where were you when I was king in this part of town?
Now the days of glory are gone

Jump to the beat of a party line
Jump to the beat of a party line
There is nobody here
But your body, dear
Jump to the beat of the party line

Jump to the beat of a party line
Jump to the beat of a party line
There is nobody here
But your body, dear
Nobody here
But your body, dear

Jump to the beat of a party line
Jump to the beat of a party line
There is nobody here
But your body, dear
Jump to the beat of the party line

Jump to the beat of a party line
Jump to the beat of a party line
There is nobody here
But your body, dear
Nobody here
But your body, dear


Some people say two is company
Sherlock Holmes found the sign of four
I don't listen to that number theory
I'm always looking for a trio, them and me
One for all and we're all for one
Musketeers have got to have the power of three

Every time I read the horoscope, I read three
Virgo, Pisces, Aquarius
Nobody can tell what's down the road for us
You could be Holmes, I'll be Watson
Every hero, yes even me
Everybody has their Moriarty

Keep your friends close
Your enemies at your side
Always keep your green eyes open wide
Depth perception, a change of direction
And all signs point to a bumpy ride
Then I saw the fourth dimension, another line
We move in space and we can move in time
Everything existed right from the start
It's the blink of an eye
It's the beat of a heart
It's the beat of a heart

We've got enemies and nemesis
And a world of possibilities
In everything you leave a clue
A little trace, a sign of you


Sitting at the old kitchen table
Peace and health and dreams
Stretching out in the darkness
Mother's up the stairs with her ageing new boyfriend
Cathy's staying in to make sure nothing happens
All aboard the freak parade
I cover up my head and pray
I'm praying for the light
Down amongst the old city chambers
Men in frocks debate all the policy changes
Everybody bet on the boom and got busted
Everybody bet and in the government trusted
Grubby little red MP
Yellow flapping hopelessly

Tory like the cat with the cream
Tory like the cat with the cream
I studied you in history
I studied in the library
In days of old when knights were bold
They'd settle it with sword and shield
In days of old when knights were bold
It's settled by the king

Praying for a friend is contagious
Specially when it comes at the old kitchen table
Listening for the swoosh of his quickening paces
Watching for the smile on the bravest of faces
How I wish you'd read to me
Verses rich in swallows and trees
Get me though the night

Waiting at the old kitchen table
Listening for my code listening for my instructions
Surely now I'm here, I am destined for greatness
I want to be the Queen pulling kids out of rivers
All aboard the freak parade
I cover up my head and pray

Praying for the cat with the cream
Praying for the cat with the cream
I studied you in history
I studied in the library
In days of old when knights were bold
They'd settle it with sword and shield
In days of old when knights were bold
It's settled by the king
It's settled by the king
It's settled by the king
It's settled by the king


Come, and steal my thoughts away
Thief of my identity
I was holding on to decency, reality
Come, and take me for a while
Up to your abundant pace
I’ll be your sidecar if you want to race
Want to race

Put your hand on mine
And take me from this tired ride
Take me from this early night
From the sea and rain and countryside
If you talk to me then soon
I’ll be your accomplice in words
And we will talk only in verse
Talk only in verse

I will leave the ones I love
Leave them for the years to come
Even though I may be doing wrong, doing wrong
I will follow in your steps
Walk out to the station cold
Buy a ticket and and then slowly go, slowly go

In this place and time
Easy is the first escape
I got money I need no disguise
I’m a citizen and city wise
In this time and place
There is no one who will shoot you down
No one who will take a girl
And tell her she can’t have the world

You constantly struggle for self improvement
You have the ability to analyse and solve any problem
You are heading in the right direction
Your mind is creative, original and alert

Boy, you don’t know what you want
It isn't what you think it is
All the dreams, and guilt and loneliness, loneliness
Boy, if we were to be friends
Subtle is the art required
To draw the evil from this lonely pyre, lonely pyre

Take this hand from me
And guide me round your tools of work
Fashion me into your junior clerk
Let me live in shadows of your words
And when things get tough for you
As they did when you came up through the ranks
You can borrow from my faith
From my faith

Take this hand from me
And guide me round your tools of work
Fashion me into your junior clerk
Let me live in shadows of your words
And when things get tough for you
As they did when you came up through the ranks
You can borrow from my faith
From my faith [x36]


I want to find this girl I know
I need to take her out
I'll set a snare in evening air
Made of faith and hope and doubt

I want to spend some time with her
Learn the secrets of her trade
I wouldn't mean to cross the line
And look into the other side
Forbidden to my kind
Forbidden to my kind

I need to hangout with my love
The raven headed sprite
I know I'll never dance like her
Or keep her up at night

I need to hang around with her
I need to let her know
Her cause is mine, I'm but a slave
I look into her wondrous gaze
And taste the strangest chord
And make the purest noise

What I would do to meet the girl
I'd stand out in the rain
Outside my window, watching close
She will appear again
Still polishing her crazy nails
Still wispy, careless, drunk on song
If I could only right my wrongs
And take her to my favourite place
And steal a melody
'Cause I need only see her face
And doubts and worries fall away
And music rushes in

Listen to the sound of life
(I don't want to be friends)
Drink deep of the day
(I don't need your advance)
Wait for her, but don't obsess
(Why do you have to ask?)
She'll go the other way
(No, I don't want to dance)

Winds will blow and storms will rage
(But your phrases are poor)
The news is always sad
(And you try hard to rhyme)
Money tends to disappear
(And I can't read your words)
Beauty crumbles with the years
(But I can read your mind)
But music is for us
(Music is for us)
Music is for us
(Music is for us)

What I would do to meet the girl
I'd stand out in the rain
Outside my window, watching close
She will appear again
Still polishing her crazy nails
Still wispy, careless, drunk on song
If I could only right my wrongs
And take her to my favourite place
And steal a melody
'Cause I need only see her face
And doubts and worries fall away
And music rushes in

If I could only see her face
And know that she was close
There is a deeper magic here
The Everlasting Muse
I left the danger for an hour
I left the sadness for a day
I know that I am in safe hands
She pays the bill and smokes cigars
And on the napkin silk
She weaves a manuscript with skill
An intro, outro, middle 8
A tapestry of words

A subtle gift to modern rock
She says "be popular, play pop"
And you will win my love
A subtle gift to modern rock
She says "be popular, play pop"
And you will win my love


I know some friends of mine
Think about them all the time
Why can't my life be like that?

I've seen them in the park
Restauranting after dark
Working out on their yoga mats
Stars of the dancehall crowd
Married young, took their vows
Comfort in their boldness and their flair

Dab hands for all to see
Stroke of brush and poetry
His cut of cloth, the contours of her hair

Thank you for the invite tonight
Perfect snacklets, perfect drinks
I'm getting ideas from your interiors
Perfect apartments, perfect kids

Perfect couples are breaking up
What have they done?
Those perfect couples are breaking up
What have they done?
Don't make me feel so good
Expect that stuff in Hollywood
Not in my current milieu

Sexual tension at the fridge
He makes for the organic figs
Belmondo lips, dangling a cig

And she, just back from her hike
And to the gallery she might
Glide by with a basket on her bike

They've got issues too
But what can you do?
Bad times
They'll always see them through

(It always lurked in her mind)
Perfect couples are breaking up
What have they done?
(In the back of her mind)
Those perfect couples are now breaking up
What have I done?
(It always lurked in his mind)
Those perfect couples are breaking up
What have they done?
(In the back of their minds)
Those perfect couples, they keep breaking up
What have I done?

Never happy with my girl
Jealous of a different world
Suddenly the years slip away

What am I waiting for?
(I see those perfect couples and I)
What makes me close the door?
I see those perfect couples
(Why can't I be like them?)

I admire the most
Finding fault with my heart
(It's always been the same and then)
And always back to the start
What makes me get in the fray
Then just throw it away
Yes I throw it away
Yes I throw it away (only to find)
Yes I throw it away (only to find)
Perfect couples are breaking up...


With your headphones on
Through the drizzled pane
Of a wet slate roof
Sun will turn to rain
Why are you the one?
Couldn't take the pain
Something good will happen, wait and see
Something good will happen, wait and see

Do you spend your day?
Second guessing faith
Looking for a way
To live so divine
Drop your sad pretence
You'll be doing fine
You will flourish like a rose in June
You will flourish like a rose in June
Ever had a little faith?
Ever had a little faith?

Morning came
The hope rose up in your heart, girl
You felt ashamed
When morning came

Roll away the stone of doubt, girl
If you're calm, then listen out for
A quiet voice, the sign from the window
Passion beating on your brow
You wish it were, you wish it was now

Past the sound of driving traffic
Past the madman's drunken attic
You climb the stair
It's dark and it's draughty
Smell of incense drawing you
Sky of light imploring you to

Then she ran from street to street
Looked up and down she must have missed him
If she could only find him she would
Throw her arms around and kiss him tenderly
She would give herself on bended knee
Never thinking if it's wrong or right
Courage sister, there's a little light
Ever had a little faith?
Ever had a little faith?

Who can you trust?
Trust the little man
Whispers in the trees
And the river can
Speak the calming verse
From the age of brave
Something good will come from nothing
Something good will come from nothing
Something good will come from nothing
Something good will come from nothing

Something good will come from nothing
Something good will come from nothing
Something good will come from nothing
Something good will come from nothing

Ever had a little faith?
Ever had a little faith?


I'm in a play written today about a boy
Who hides in attics when the sun is up
Everyone is at work

What will I do? Where will I go?
Show me the way, the truth, the anger
Show me rules of thumb
Show the way to grow old

Love is a guide
The endless river of the soul
But we are mean
The dried up riverbeds of rock and stone
Lust is my friend
She comes to me when I am tired

Life is a road, death is a myth
Love is a fraud, it's misunderstood
Work is a sentence, family's a drag
This house is a trap

I'm in a play written today about a girl
She gets on perfectly with young and old
Everybody loves her

What will she wear? The cut of her hair
The way that she slides
Gracefully into the working week
She hides her baggage inside

She's got a friend
An ugly monster that will eat your face
She hides a crime
A hefty catalog of wasted time
She's got a friend
A lonely monster that will prey on you

Life is a secret, death is a myth
Love is a fraud, it's misunderstood
Work is a sentence, family's a drag
This house is a trap

Life is a secret, death is a myth
Love is a fraud, it's misunderstood
Work is a sentence, family's a drag
This house is a trap

I'm in a play written today about a boy
Tired and melancholy takes the weight
Takes the weight of the world

I walked alone, loving the sun
Walking the earth
A worn out sister who was twenty three
Dried and wrinkled, alone

I'll give you a month
To see past shadows in your sacred mind
Give you a week
To look Medusa in the eye
I'll give you a month
To notice heaven at the side of stage

(Author, author! Author, author!)

You're king inside your head
You're sitting on a throne of sand
You're pushing back the tide
So lift the mountain up
So tie the writer's ribbons down
Assemble all your troops
We go to war with metaphors
You'll suddenly see sense (and suddenly see sense)
And when you do, I'll have the higher grounds (I'll have the higher grounds)
You're not the king of me
I'll take my chance and play for tyranny
I build the sets, I light the scene
We're braver when we're on the sacred screen
I build the sets, I light the scene
We're braver when we're on the sacred screen
The backstage of your life
Is filled with props and lines you should have sung
The backstage of your life
Is filled with echoes of the ones you loved


Everybody’s making plans 
For tomorrow
Stone can turn to sand 
But I just
I want to take you back in time
I’ll draw the line
I would write a different story
A new final act
I don’t need the drama 
But I would never write you out

Everyone’s a thread 
We’re woven together
Read it in the tears and fraying edges
Read the book of you
The book of me
We’re fading into memory
But something is left
A gesture, a phrase or a photograph
The warp and weft

We’re always walking in the rain
And you’re just trouble, so I claim
Pretend the world can see
That I’m the one for you
And you’re the one for me

Valentine, if you could change 
With the weather
Faith would just evaporate
Untethered 
In a fresh disguise
I catch your eye
See behind the mask 
And find you never went far
That’s not the last time 
I’ve thought about the way we are

We’re always walking in the rain
And you’re just trouble, so I claim
But then the world can see
That I’m the one for you
And you’re the one for me


Today
I want to slip back to the dream I had
When you had urged me to look out
Upon the window of my life

Today
The choices have all clashed upon my head
Is it wrong to leave your charges
And go charging round the bend?

Mansions, there are mansions in the sun
There's no hiding
Defying the night
Come out into the light
Today

Today
My thoughts were like a tent put up in heaven
Build a shelter for your mind
Invite a stranger to come in and share the wine

Mansions, there are mansions in the sun
There's no hiding
Defying the night
Come out into the light
Today

Today
They want to tear my body from my mind
The rust will show
I am an iron bridge that's giving into time

Today
The wind blows west the heather and the broom becalms
The spirit of a fighting man and lays him
Where his wild spirit belongs

Victims will be justified
The lame will be leaping
This army's for peace
Come out into the light
Today

Victims will be justified
The lame are believing
This army's for peace
Come out into the light
Today


There is a girl on the floor, she dances way out
She’s a snub nose beauty, she’s a no doubt
But if I talk to her, I even look hard
She’ll be out of this place and she’ll be out of my life

So we busted a move we got the hell out
We got stories to tell, we got our whole life
We drink coffee till late because we jet lagged
We put a fortune into the greatest
Music machine in the land

Play a wonderful song to me and it’s better than a date
Play the tune where the girl sings high
She’s my lover surrogate
And the waitress is rolling by, shining high
Smiling for a tip
Every boy dreams of it

So the girl dances in, she takes the next booth
I break the rule of my life, I make a big move
Cos my accent is funny, got a head start
If you wanna make good, you got to use what you got

We go with her friends and there’s a big crowd
There’s a girl who can’t stand up till she falls down
There’s a pressure that’s building and it’s too late
Cos eh leaves in the morning, there’s a flight
It’s a family affair

Play a wonderful song to me and it’s better than a date
Play the tune where the girl sings high 
She’s my lover surrogate
And the waitresses rolling by, shining high
Smiling for a tip
Every boy dreams of it

So we met a month later, she had long hair
She was driving the bus I paid the full fare
It was easy to talk and she drove real fast
And she told me the story of her dirty old past

All the boys she had loved and all the bad sex
All the things she must learn and all her prospects
I was there for the ride and for the old soul
But we couldn’t go further, no we couldn’t go
But we couldn’t go further, no we couldn’t go
But we couldn’t go further cos the story was already told


Two birds sitting on a wire
Big one makes his move
He spreads his feathers, rubs his beak
Boy and girl are leaving school
He is shy, but she will follow him
She don’t know why

Life is short, and then you sleep

Pull down the wall
It’s only masking honesty
Pull down the wall
It’s breaking up the family
Pull down the wall
Hear the true call
Start the day with little things
They’ll blossom into prayers and little wings

Look at what is in your heart
How could it be wrong?
The little man is telling you
People gathering in the square
They’ve had enough
Their leaders they are killing them

Life is short, and then you sleep

Pull down the wall 
It’s only masking honesty
Pull down the wall
It’s breaking up the family
Pull down the wall
Hear the true call
Start the day with little things
They’ll blossom into prayers and little wings

When all the banks began to fail
I thought that we would have a change
But they found all this cash
We didn’t have to patch it up again
They never think to spend the money
On the everlasting broke
Or the sick, what a waste

Two birds in the promised land
One is building walls to keep the other in its place
Imprisoned like the special son
He became the greatest, broke his chains and busted out

Life is short, and then you sleep

Pull down the wall 
It’s only masking honesty
Pull down the wall
It’s breaking up the family
Pull down the wall
Hear the true call
Start the day with little things
They’ll blossom into prayers and little wings


I’m alone
I’m not with you
When I get in at night the many facets of the conversation
Roll around inside my head

Who’s going with who?
Who’s going with you?
You are the girl who for a twist plays ventriloquist 
To other boys line up to be your pooch

But if I draw a circle and I walk around it
You’re the piggy in the middle
I love my little pig until it hurts

I want to dance
Give the boy a chance
I want to lose myself in 1986
The darkened cinematic days of love and trance

Your crisp white tee – shirt
Rock a bill eee – hurts
An army of affected youth 
They’re cute in boots
I look at her the girl is looking back at me

And with a thought that cuts me
She will turn and curtsey to her rockabilly boyfriend
It’s too late the damage done

I will catch them on the stairs
I’m like a bad smell that stays
They will turn round and see me 
They will kiss stroke and feel
Just for the benefit: the boy voyeur
His camera makes up for what he’s lost

You know I know you’re the Queen
But when there’s nothing to rule
Who is the fool?

Wait for spring
I want to sing
Sleep is a drag love is the drug flu is the bug 
I got my bag it’s full of stuff I want to bring

There is a club
There is a girl
Give her the secret sign that I’ll be there
A little clue
Maybe she’ll pick it up
Maybe she’ll pass

But I go into the building and she’s over by the bar
And by the time they play New Order
She is over in the corner

And she’s telling me stuff
I think she feels pretty rough
She has to lean on her shoulder
She is drunk, I am sober
And I take her confession
It’s the coolest little session of the month
As I take her confession
I confess I got my hand under her blouse


The cherry tree is broken
The maple leaf is brown
The wind is in the north east
It’s blowing through the town
Morning is the mother
She pulls you out of bed
Noon is like the sister
No hiding from the threat

I want you for a lover
I want you in the dusk
Your thoughts are deep, unspoken
Buried in your past
The cherry tree is broken
The maple is a lie
The north east wind is building
The people go inside
I want to stay in this place
Where thoughts are warm and bright 
I want to stay by your side
And listen to your words
The chaos is unbroken
All the news is grim
Feeds into the conscience
Chase away the dream

The cherry tree is broken
The maple has blown down
The water it is rising
The power has gone out
I want to find some respite
From ignorance and lies
I run from passing strangers
I run from evil eyes
I need to take some shelter
I look for you in storms
I know you have a foxhole 
I know it’s dark and warm
I see you in the kitchen
I see you by the fire
Absorbing life’s great stories
Drinking from your eyes

Drinking wine in goblets
Knees tucked to the chin
Sitting in a straw chair
Hair like golden sun
Love you in the firelight
Love you in the dark
Think one day I’ll tell you
That accidents can spark
A trail of life’s destruction
A fissure of intent
A comfort blanket hanging
For every crisis spent.
Think one day I’ll tell you
I’ll catch you from behind
Cover eyes to trick you
Guessing will decide

The ash is like my brother
He took the lazy path
To summer and the good life
The last leaf in the park

A wise old head on shoulders
On boards of adamant
He watched us by the river
He watched us in the dusk
Ribbons fell from your hair
They came down from the war
The drunks fell out of houses
The food of love would flow
And just then for the one day
Beneath the tree of joy
We were equal in our beauty
To the sunset girls and boys
You’re too cool to rush in
Which lover could it be
A politician’s silence
Will be the death of me


Shimmering travellin' light, echoing love at first sight
Glimmering, Glistening, banishing the darkest night
Waiting for travellin' light

Though the sun has yet to appear
Inkling faint perception is near
Bloodied, battered in the dew
Leaves and trees are calling you
Waiting for travellin' light

Shimmering, travelling by
Magical waves just under the sky
It knows no time, it knows no bounds
Coming clear beneath the clouds
Destination here and now
I behold travellin' light

Shimmering, travelling by
Magical waves just under the sky
She knows no time, she knows no bounds
Waves of light are travelling
Cloak of night unravelling
I believe in travellin' light

Shimmering, travellin' light, echoing love at first sight
Glimmering, glistening, I'll see her tomorrow night
Waiting for my travellin' light

I'm sick, and I've felt this way for some time now
I'm so fed up with the daily grind
I'm trying to find relief
If you feel this way then clap your hands
Ever thought this was a backward land?
What is making people mean?
A bad scene

Now that I've got my motives straight and I am thinking clearly
I'll sneak up to your window with my senses open wide

I'm tired, on my shoulders weighing heavily
Is the full responsibility for your troubles and your charms
Your betrayal goes around with me
Like the sword in some old tragedy
It is sticking in my back
People laugh

Now that I've got my motives straight and I am thinking clearly
I'll sneak up to your window with my senses open wide

I never really thought it would be like this
I know it's kind of hard but I'm glad that it is
I'm glad

[Instrumental]

Now that I've got my motives straight and I am thinking clearly
I'll sneak up to your window with my senses open wide

I'm glad


There is no way I'm looking for a boyfriend
There is no way I'm looking for a scene
I need to save some dough
I'm a working girl, you know
I'll fend attention off I keep to myself

I love my room, I'm getting used to sleeping
Some nights I really like to lie awake
I hear the midnight birds
The message in their words
The dawn will touch me in a way a boy could never touch
Their promise never meant so much to me 

You have been warned, I'm born to be contrary 
Backward at school, I wrote from right to left
Teacher never cared for me
Preacher said a prayer for me
God help the girl, she needs all the help she can get

I sit for hours just waiting for his phone call
I'll leave the chocolate hidden in the fridge
I'll play his messages
Analyze his intonation
Please stop me there, I'm even boring myself

I think of him when I'm doing the dishes
I think of him while looking in the sink
This ain't no play on words
My love for him is absurd 
If he gave me a sign I'd think about it for a week 
I'd build it up and then I'd turn him down

You have been warned, I'm born to be contrary 
Backward at school, I wrote from right to left
Teacher never cared for me
Preacher said a prayer for me
God help the girl, she needs all the help she can get


I took a? long hard look
At the heroes of my youth.
And their antics on the page there on
Can no longer sustain me
Ever since I was a boy
They brought me joy
But the shackles of the way I was
Can no longer contain me

It was exciting
And enlightening
Reverberating through my dreams
Goodbye to reality
And set a course for wayward schemes.

Now I can't sing
I can't feel
I don't know what is real.
I was travelling through the past for years
Tell me what's my destination
Now the past is gone
I don't even have a song
We've not sung before
To a closing door
Tell me what's my situation?

I saw the film,
I lived the book
I got the haircut
That's all it took
But now I know it's going to take
A little more now I'm awake

I took along hard look
Now I'm waiting for the phone to ring
I glance at the inbox
Is there any tantalising mail there in
There was lust in my restless heart
But now I know what true love means
Goodbye to reality
And set sail for dreamsy


Animals come, banging their drums
Street clears in summer
kids run around, having their fun
men are already drunk

A religious holiday's begun
maybe it's because we have no sun

Marching begins, animals sing
words that are twisted to
meanings of hate, look at the face
bitter and ready to fight

a religious holiday's begun
maybe it's because we have no sun

Lost in the crowd
shouting loud
Drinking my fill of a bottle of gin
I'll do anything to help me forget about you

You're full of it,
You hopelessly flirt
with that girl who works in the pub for a night
but at closing time
you will be at my door
Tell me what it is I have to do?
I'd sacrifice everything for you.

I was feeling so good and the sun was shining
all I wanted was to get across the street
I made my biggest mistake when I left her with a yelling match
and a broken kettle.
I'm sick of this, you're a little kid
I always have to bail you out
when you take off with your drinking friends
and their idiot games
If you sing the songs you half deserve to take a beat

They beat me up 'cause I crossed the march
they said I need to learn a bit of respect
but I am on their side and I follow the team
when I get out of here
somebody's gonna get it.


My baby came to me lately
'Honey, please don't take this bad, but maybe
When you laid me
Could we try to spice it up?'

I looked across the table
First to see if she was joking
No joke
There was no flicker
Just a girl who wanted more

Than meat and potatoes
She may stop at whips and chains
She needs carousal
More arousal
A bit of pain

So we started by using handcuffs
We tried a can of cold whipped cream
I was allergic to so much dairy
She had to finish it all by herself

Then I slapped her
She wasn't expecting
So she hit me back
She friggin' cracked me
I got a nose bleed
She was angry
She wanted more

Than mean and potatoes
She may stop at pumps and drains!
She needs carousal
More arousal
A bit of pain

Invite the neighbours
Or total strangers
Give yourself a leg up, honey
Wear 'The Queen' mask
Put on the French basque
It's full of handy holes
If we're going to use them all
We're going to need more than

Meat and potatoes!
She may draw the line at dolls and freaks
She needs some abusing
Some amusement
To get through the week

'I know you respect me
You won't reject me
And the arrow of our love is straight and true'


Saw a suit in Daddy's wardrobe, I took a swipe
Lapels, size of islands, gangster white line pinstripe
Laughed off the street in the name of my rock'n'roll
Still a caterwauling groove will start off vacation
Eighties plastic Soul don't give palpatation
Richie, he no like, he call out the firing squad

ba ba ba...

Richie look for suede, me I look for leather
Sartorially we groove, occasional disaster
For tight black canvas no make for a straight legged sixties scenester
Then we hit the street with poise of commando
Clothes, guitar but arsenal missing one thing
Exotic Glasgow chick, they call her the 'Carmen Veranda'

ba ba ba...

Me and Richie dream to be like Mr Richard
Strung-out and?secure yes we make like junkie
Hooked up on that stuff they call it the Rock'n'roll
I need to consecrate, I need consecration
Clipped and soulful guitar riffing out the nation
The nation in my head, the national sixties sensation

ba ba ba....


I think it's going to be all right
I think it's going to be just fine
I think it's going to get much better than before

I think we're going to see the sun
I think we're going to have some fun,
I think we're going walk out through the open door

And maybe when we wake up in the morning
Maybe when the darkness starts to fade
Maybe in a paper boat we'll both just float away

Underneath the river trees
Off towards a lazy sea
Underneath the bridge that carries people home

Past the church where Jesus saves
Up and down upon the waves
Sailing off towards adventures of our own

Maybe when we wake up in the morning,
Maybe when the darkness starts to fade
Maybe in a paper boat we'll both just float away

Maybe when we wake up in the morning,
Maybe when the trumpet starts to play
Maybe in a paper boat we'll both just float away

I think it's going to be good fun


I finally gave myself the time to see you
I finally gave myself the time to see you
I finally gave myself the time to see you for a while
If only we could see past the veneer we'd see another side of you

Simone said she would think about not seeing me
Simone said she would think about not seeing me
Simone said she would think about not seeing me for a while
I hung around with her for forty days and forty nights, it was a wilderness

If only you would stop, look and listen
If only you would stop, look and listen
If only you would stop, look and listen you'd be fine
But being deaf and being blind just seems to be the way you spend your time

Being alone, it's not a problem when I think of you
Being alone, it's not a problem when I think of you
Being alone, it's not a problem when I think of you
Your words are true and all I do is dream

Spent summer in the city of my childhood
Spent summer in the city of my childhood
Spent summer in the city of my childhood for old times
But there's no going back for me, the faces had all changed I was a stranger

He made the same mistake 'til he got wiser
He made the same mistake 'til he got wiser
By then it was too late and he despised her, what a crime
If he was cruel to be kind, he would've saved the trouble and the time

Being alone, it's not a problem when I think of you
Being alone, it's not a problem when I think of you
Being alone, it's not a problem when I think of you
Your words are true and all I do
Think of you, your words are true and all I do
Think of you, your words are true and all I do is dream

I live alone the silence it can make you
I live alone the silence it can take you
I live alone the silence it can break you after a while
Not long ago I made a deal, the ghosts around the house all seem to like me

My life is falling down I am surrounded
My life is falling down I am confounded
My life is falling down I am dumbfounded, what a mess
I lay back silent as a cat and let you work your mysteries of healing

Being alone, it's not a problem when I think of you
Being alone, it's not a problem when I think of you
Being alone, it's not a problem when I think of you
Your words are true and all I do
Think of you, your words are true and all I do
Think of you, your words are true and all I do is dream


I'm sitting around at the checkpoint
Keeping myself to myself
My heart's going out to the girl with the gun
She is young, she is fun, she is deadly

She clocks off, goes back to the city
Goes to a club with her friends

I just took a walk through the checkpoint
Past columns of poor Arab sons
They queue through the day for a chance to make pay
For something to put in their mouths

He can't sleep at night without gunfire
The lullaby puts him to sleep

We stand there accused of the British collusion
Israel into Palestine
A victory for some an astonishing hope
But for him it has brought devastation
He lives like a prisoner in exile
He lives like a prisoner in hell

Dates black and white in the blue vault of space
Swoop around like a symbol of peace
Can they see the hawk?
They're too busy in talk of love
Why should they contemplate fear?

Everyone meets in the cramped city streets
Hipsters of zion collide
To talk music and dross
At the sign of The Cross
We eat our falafel in peace
The girl lets her uniform slip
The boy cracks a joke he is sweet
He listens to Hip Hop in Gaza
She listens to Coldplay in Lod

Hey
Hey Sorrow, the trembling sorrow
Let me sing the goodbye music
All the skeletons are burnt to ashes
the dying bodies go back into the earth The gods of death will line up now
On the field they are marching
They are covered in blackness
but each one will burn bright red! Sorrow this living sorrow
Throw it away and make a beginning
All the color will go into the earth
float away you proud living soldiers The gods of death will line up now
On the field they are marching
They are covered in blackness
but each one will burn bright red! To dying men, to all of their good women
to dying girls, to all of thier boyfriends
To dying men, to all of their women
To all our loved ones peace we will protect What will they have to commit to
How much will they leave behind
I pray, pray to bring you a new day interlude Sorrow, the painful sorrow
Nothing left, except this sadness
We destroy these nameless soldiers
We survive by spilling our blood The gods of death are arriving
On the wings of a windstorm
There's no way to resist them
No place for anyone to run To dying men, to all of their good women
to dying girls, to all of thier boyfriends
To dying men, to all of their women
To all our loved ones peace we will protect (one more time) To fighting men, to women at home waiting
To fighting girls, to all the boys that they love
To dying men, to all of their women
To all our loved ones peace we will protect What will they have to commit to
How much will they leave behind
I pray, pray to bring you a new day I love New York City
Oh yeah, New York City
I love New York City
Oh yeah, New York City Run it over, run them out
Knock your block or tearing your doubt
Move on corners, move around
Talk no talk, breaking you down We are a corporation, we are a company
We cut high but we're cuttin high anyway
We are your mother's father, we are your fighter friend
It never started and it won't end I love New York City
Oh yeah, New York City
I love New York City
Oh yeah, New York City Broken faces, burnt and bent
Deal off the love song from every white man
Ride on nothin', ride your head
Got no fear, sayin' not said We are a population, we are a factory
We don't do, but we never did anyway
We are your mother's father, we are your fighter friend
You can't start what you can't end I love New York City

But now that I do

She don't need any better

The girl's too young
She don't know any better
It's all coming back

She is beautiful

The girl's too young
She don't know any better
It's all coming back
I can feel it And though I never know you
I look at your face.
To tell you that I love you
Don't know what to say
Give everything I got to the beautiful girl
The only thing I live for in the whole wide world (Coro:)
She is beautiful

The girl is beautiful
She is beautiful Inside The Locker Room
Outside The Rain Is Pouring Down
We're Hiding From The Storm
And Talking Softly Then Without Looking Up
You Said To Me
That You May Not Come Back Again And Then You Looked At Me
The Stormy Rain Was In Your Eyes
And You Were So Sincere
And Full Of Sadness I Had No Words To Say
And What Could I Have Done
To Make You Stay With Me? The Passing Time And The Passing Seasons
Keep Going Past Me And I Keep Rolling
I Have No Shadow Of Doubt
A Strong Wind Blows And We Run
And We Run
The Sweat Pours Down
But We Keep On A Running
And Forget Our Pain If We Get To That Place
And Cross That Line
I'll Get Down On My Knees
And Tell You How I Feel Remember All The Times
We Snuck Into The School Yard
Our Days A Treasure Still
A Time Together We Laid Upon The Grass
We Counted Stars Upon Our Backs
And Sailed Away Your Thoughts Are On Your Mind
Those Secret Words I'll Never Hear
And Then You Looked At Me And
Smiled Slightly
Will You Now Walk Away
And Leave This Room Forever
Without Looking Back? My Heart Was Broken
With Words Unspoken
This Simple Boy
Had His Love Rejected
My Dreams Have Always Been
Oh So Far Away From Me And We Run
And We Run
The Sweat Pours Down
But We Keep On A Running
And Forget Our Pain If We Get To That Place
And Cross That Line
I'll Get Down On My Knees
And Tell You How I Feel But Today We Are Here
And We Still Run
We Can See Where We're Going
By The Light Of The Sun We Were Too Hot To Speak
Too Hot For Words
We Were Speechless In The Rain
Upon That Long, Hot Day Even Though You Don't Know Me
I Know That You Live Alone
Because I Listen To You Cry Even Though You Don't Know Me
Oh Oh Oh Confidential Love
From An Undercover Spy Even Though You Don't Know Me
I Want, I Want, I Want To Take You Out
I Want To Take You On A Date Let's Go On A Date - Let's Go On A Date
Go On A Date

I Want To Take You On A Date
Let's Go On A Date - Let's Go On A Date

I Want To Take You On A Date Even Though You Don't Know Me
I Know I Could Treat You Right
And I Could Keep You Satisfied Even Though You Don't Know Me
No Oh Oh You're My Angel
Gosh, I Wish Wasn't So Shy Even Though You Don't Know Me
I Want, I Want, I Want To Take You Out
I Want To Take You On A Date

We Have To Face Our Fear
We Have To Face Our Fear When We Look Into The Future
To The Place We Haven't Gone

Will Tomorrow Ever Come?
This Is Where We're Coming From
And We're Not The Only Ones When We Find Ourselves In Trouble
We Can Find Ourselves A Way
You Can Find A Place To Stay
And The Place Is Always Safe If You Have A Heart That's In Pain
Don't Be Afraid
You're Not To Blame

If I Do It All Now Don't Be Waiting For Luck
Find A Way To Do More
Are We Doing This?
What Are We Doing This For? Because We Can...
Before The End Of Our Lives
The End Of Our Lives

So I Made A Mission My Goal
And A Vision My Job Made A Mission My Goal
But The Vision Got Lost If You Only Do Good
And You Figure It Out
If I Do What I Should
And I Do It All Now Don't Be Waiting For Luck
Find A Way To Do More
Are We Doing This?
What Are We Doing This For? To Love The Times We Have
To Like What Makes Us Sad
To Live When Others Die
To Loose And Say Goodbye
To Last Until Our Moment Comes But It Isn't Over
You Know It Isn't Over
You Know It Isn't Over
You Know It Isn't Over
You Know It Isn't Done Before The End Of Our Lives
The End Of Our Lives
The End Of Our Lives
Before The End Of Our Lives Just Because This Life Ain't Easy
Doesn't Make It Bad It Isn't Over
It Can't Be Over

On Your Island In The Sea So We Meet And Time Goes By
We Write Letters Filled With Love
The Emotion In Your Words
Gives Me Hope About My Life So We Share Our Every Thought

Everybody, This Is My World
And I Live Upon My Landscape
Inside A Dream Of My Creation
Product Of My Imagination
I Am The King Of My Own Nation My World
An Overload Of Endless Wonder
For A Design Of Grand Delusion
Into A Private Life Seclusion
How I Delight In Such Confusion This Is My World
'Cause This Is My World
And This Is My Time
I Live In My World
I Live In My Mind
'Cause This Is My World

There Is Some People
Who Want Me Down And I, No
That They'll Never
Want Me Aroun' But I've Got Know Fear
Anymore Know Fear?
No Way
No Way
No Way Whoever Said That Life Would Be Easy
Never Walked A Mile In My Shoes
Everyday A Desire Awaits Me
There Is Nothing Else I Can Do
But Fight Against All Odds
Against The Deadly Soul
That's Living In My Heart
I Won't Give Up, I Won't Give In
I Won't Give Out Or Fall Apart
This Is The Mountain I Must Climb
This Is My Time
And All At Once The Shadows Disappear
I Move Around The Side
And Into The Clear The Weight Of The Light
Weighing Down On The Glass
Makes It Hard To Tell If You're Going
Or To Tell If You're Coming To Pass
How Do You Tell If Time Has Gone By? And I Don't Want To Believe Anymore
No, I Don't Want To Believe
And I Don't Want To See What I've Already Seen
Or Be What I've Been And I Don't Want To Be Me Anymore
And I Don't Want To Be Free
And I Don't Want To Feel How I Felt
When I Used To Believe When I Held Back The Light
And The Long Heavy Air
With It's Touches Of Grace
Made The Openings Appear
Now I'm Into The Clear Yeah Something's Starting
Don't Know What It Is It Won't Stop Starting
And I Don't Think I Can Live It's A Way To Make Me Pay
But It Just Makes Me Mad Another Fight For Another Day
Look Out I'm Coming Bad Coming Bad My Life's Been Going 'Round
But It's All Coming Bad Again
And Now My Whole Time's Been Ruined Down
And It's All Coming Up Again Now I Don't Care About School Anymore
And I Really Don't Care About Rules
I Really Don't Care If I'm Cool Anymore
And I Really Don't Care About You And I Don't Want To Go To Sleep
And I'll Come Around All Day Long
And I Don't Want To Ever Have To Eat Again
And I'll Come Around 'Til You're Gone
'Cause I'm Coming Bad Hey, Look What We're Doing This Time
We've Got Things That You Ain't Even Tried
We Want Fun And We'll Get It From You
We Don't Know And Don't Care What You Do You Look Back And You See What You Did

Well, I Can Tell From The Road Ahead That The Road Is Long And When I'm Flying...
Well, I Can Tell From The Way It Feels That It Can't Be Wrong Woah
You Can't Tell Me 'Bout The Way It Was
And You Can't Show Me What A Real Man Does
But I Can See What You Do With My Eye When I'm High...
Well, I Can See Myself And Not Know Where I Am And When I'm Dying...
Well, I Can Loose My Breathe And Still Have Full Command Woah
You Can't See Me Like The Way I Can
You're Talking To Me But You Never Listen, Man
And I Won't To Listen To The Way You Were
Or Why You Had To Do It Like You Did To Her
I'm Hanging By A Thread From The Fabric Of The Open Sky
When I'm High... When I'm Lying...
Well, I Don't Claim To Speak Your Truth Or Keep Your Peace
And That Confirms I Never Knew Your Disbelief
And Now You See Me Where I Stand
With Your Bride When I'm High... Your World Is Shutting Down
No Real Friends
No One Understands You
And No One Ever Will You're Worthless Anyway
You've Never Done Anything Worthwhile
Why Bother Trying?
Nothing Will Ever Change
Nothing Matters
There's No Use Living Anymore You've Never Been In Love
And No One Will Ever Love You
You Don't Deserve To Live
Nothing Makes You Happy
And No One Cares
Your World Is Shutting Down You're Getting Older Every Day
Slowly Coming To An End
There's Nothing 
No One Can Help You
It's Ending And You're Completely Alone You're Alone In The World
Life Means Nothing
No One Understands You 
And No One Cares
Every Day It Will Cotinue On
Why Bother Trying? Can The World Be As Sad As It Seems? It Is Ending
Ending You're All Alone 
And You Just Feel Like Crying
And You're Always Down
You Just Don't Feel Like Trying People Pass And Live Their Lives
While You Still Go Nowhere
You Stay At Home 
And Sleep All Day
No One Really Cares So It's Time To End It All
So You Lay Down On It
Your World Is Coming Down Today
So Just Lay Down On It So You've Come To Analyze Me
And Tell Me Where I Belong
But Don't You Put Your Finger On Me
I'm A Vagabond So You've Come To Criticize Me
Before I Have To Move On
But Don't You Put Your Finger On Me
I'm A Vagabond You Even Tried To Hypnotize Me
Until The Cold Morning Dawn
But You Can't Put Your Finger On Me
I'm A Vagabond So Now You've Come To Apologize
But I Am Already Gone
And You Can't Put Your Finger On Me
I'm A Vagabond

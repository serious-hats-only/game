Here's the story of a lovely lady 
Who was bringing up three very lovely girls. 
All of them had hair of gold, like their mother, 
The youngest one in curls. 

Here's the story, of a man named Family, 
Who was busy with three boys of his own, 
They were four men, living all together, 
Yet they were all alone. 

Till the one day when the lady met this fellow 
And they knew it was much more than a hunch, 
That this group must somehow form a family. 
That's the way we all became the Family Five. 

The Family Five, 
The Family Five, 
That's the way we became the Family Five.

New boy in the neighborhood 
Lives downstairs and it's understood. 
He's there just to take good care of me, 
Like he's one of the family.

Of our days and our nights 
Mom in Charge 
Of our wrongs and our rights 

And I sing, I want, 
I want Mom in Charge of me. 

Mom in Charge 
Of our days and our nights 
Mom in Charge 
Of our wrongs and our rights 

And I sing, I want, 
I want Mom in Charge of me.


Making your way in the world today 
Takes everything you've got, 
Taking a break from all your worries 
Sure would help a lot. 
Wouldn't you like to get away? 

All those night when you've got no lights, 
The check is in the mail, 
And your little angel 
Hung the cat up by its tail, 
And your third fiance didn't show, 

Sometimes you want to go 
Where everybody knows your name, 
And they're always glad you came, 
You want to be where you can see, 
Our troubles are all the same, 
You want to be where everybody knows your name. 

Roll out of bed, Mr Coffee's dead, 
The morning's looking bright, 
And your shrink ran off to Europe, 
And didn't even write, 
And your husband wants to be a girl, 

Be glad there's one place in the world 
Where everybody knows your name, 
And they're always glad you came, 
You want to go where people know, 
People are all the same, 
You want to go where everybody knows your name. 

Where everybody knows your name, 
And they're always glad you came, 
Where everybody knows your name, 
And they're always glad you came.


There's a place you've got to go for learning 
all you want to know about the facts of life 
the facts of life. 

When books are what you're there about 
and looks are what you care about 
the time is right, 
to learn the facts of life. 

When the world never seems 
to be living up to your dreams 
it's time you started finding out 
what everything is all about 

When the boys you used to hate you date, 
I guess you best investigate 
the facts of life you gotta get em right 
the facts of life, 
the facts of life, 
the facts of life 


You take the good, you take the bad, 
you take them both and there you have 
The facts of life, the facts of life. 

There's a time you got to go and show 
You're growin now you know about 
The facts of life, the facts of life. 



It's a rare condition, this day and age, 
to read any good news on the newspaper page. 
Love and tradition of the grand design, 
some people say it's even harder to find. 

Well then there must be some magic clue inside these gentle walls 
Cause all I see is a tower of dreams 
real love burstin out of every seam. 

As days go by, 
we're gonna fill our house with happiness. 
The moon may cry, 
we're gonna smother the blues with tenderness. 

When days go by, 
there's room for you, 
room for me, 
for gentle hearts an opportunity. 

As days go by, 
it's the bigger love of the family.


I bet we been together for a million years, 
And I bet we'll be together for a million more. 

Oh, It's like I started breathing on the night we kissed, 
And I can't remember what I ever did before. 

What would we do baby, Without Us? 
What would we do baby, Without Us? 

And there ain't no nothing we can't love each other through. 

What would we do baby, Without Us? 

Sha la la la.


Whatever happened to predictability
The milkman, the paperboy, evening TV
How did I get delivered here
Somebody tell me, please
This old world's confusing me

With clouds as mean as you've ever seen
Ain't a bird who knows your tune.
Then a little voice inside you whispers,
Kid don't sell your dreams, so soon

Everywhere you look
Everywhere you look.
There's a heart
There's a heart.
A hand to hold onto
Everywhere you look
Everywhere you look.
There's a face
Of somebody who needs you
Everywhere you look

When you're lost out there
and you're all alone,
A light is waiting
to carry you home.
Everywhere you look
Everywhere you look
doop-a-dee-ba-ba-dow. 


Show me that smile again. Show me that smile. 
Don't waste another minute on your cryin. 
We're nowhere near the end, nowhere near. 
The best is ready to begin. 

Oooohhh. As long as we got each other 
We got the world spinnin right in our hands. 
Baby you and me, we gotta be 
The luckiest dreamers who never quit dreamin. 

As long as we keep on givin 
we can take anything that comes our way 
Baby, rain or shine, all the time 
We got each other, sharin the laughter and love.


Love and Marriage, Love and Marriage, 
Go together like a horse and carriage, 
This I tell ya brother, you can't have one without the other. 

Love and Marriage, Love and Marriage, 
It's an institute you can't disparage, 
Ask the local gentry, and they will say is elementary. 

Try, try, try to separate them, 
It's an illusion. 
Try, try, try and you will only come 
to this conclusion. 

Love and Marriage


You can count on me. 
No matter what you do. 
You can count on me. 
No matter where you go. 

I'm standing by your side. 
I'll be right behind. 
No one loves you more than I do, 
Put your hand in mine. 

I can see a part of me in you. 
A little something special that comes shining through. 
I hear it in your laughter, 
And I feel it when you cry, 
I will be right there for you, 
Until the day I die. 

You can count on me. 
No matter what you do. 
You can count on me. 
No matter where you go. 
You can count on me.


Sometimes the world looks perfect, 
Nothing to rearrange. 
Sometimes you just get a feeling 
Like you need some kind of change. 
No matter what the odds are this time, 
Nothing's going to stand in my way. 
This flame in my heart, 
Like a long lost friend 
Gives every dark street a light at the end. 

Standing tall, on the wings of my dream. 
Rise and fall, on the wings of my dream. 

The rain and thunder 
The wind and haze 
I'm bound for better days. 
It's my life and my dream, 
Nothing's going to stop me now. 
Nothing's going to stop me.
It's my life and my dream, 
Nothing's going to stop me now. 

Nothing's going to stop me now. 


Maybe the world is blind, 
Or just a little unkind. 
Don't know. 

Seems you can't be sure 
Of anything anymore. 
Although, 

You maybe lonely and then, 
One day you're smiling again. 
Every time I turn around, 
I see the girl who turns my world around. 
Standing there. 

Everytime I turn around, 
Her spirit's lifting me right off the ground. 
What's gonna be? 
Guess we'll just wait and see.


If what doesn't kill us is making us stronger,
We're gonna last longer
Than that greatest wall in China
Or that rabbit with the drum

If there's one thing that I've learned
While waiting for my turn,
It's that in each life some rain falls
But you also get some sun

And we'll make out better than okay
Hear what I say
Hey, any day


Set in my ways 
losing track of the days 
Only me to live for. 
Had no need to give more 
Than I wanted to. 

Spending my time 
just holding the line 
Never getting caught up. 
Love was never brought up 
It's not the thing to do. 

It was you, 
Then came you. 
You made me leap without taking a look. 
It was you, 
Then came you. 
You reeled me right in line, sinker, and hook. 
Never thought forever was the best I could do. 

Then came you. 

It was you 
and me and you 
Then came you 

It was you 
and me and you 

It was you 
and me and 
Then came you 


There's a time for love and a time for living. 
You take a chance and face the wind. 
An open road and a road that's hidden 
A brand new life around the bend. 

There were times when I lost a dream or two. 
Found the trail, and at the end was you. 
There's a path you take and a path untaken 
The choice is up to you my friend. 

Nights are long but you might awaken 
To a brand new life, 
Brand new life, 
Brand new life around the bend.


When this Boy Meets World 
Boy Meets World 
Wandering down this road, that we call life 
Is what we're doin 
It's good to know I have friends that will always 
Stand by me 
When this Boy Meets World.


Now this is the story all about how, 
My life got flipped-turned upside down, 
And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there, 
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air. 

In West Philadelphia, born and raised 
On the playground is where I spent most of my days. 
Chillin out, maxin, relaxin all cool, 
And all shootin some B-ball outside of the school. 

When a couple of guys who were up to no good, 
Started makin trouble in my neighborhood. 
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared, 
And said You're movin with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air. 

I whistled for a cab, and when it came near, 
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror. 
If anything I could say that this cab was rare, 
But I thought Nah forget it, Yo home to Bel Air. 

I pulled up to the house about seven or eight, 
and I yelled to the cabby Yo homes, smell ya later. 
Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there, 
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air.


Sister, sister
Talk about a two-way twister
Shaking up the family tree
With sibling synchronicity

Sister, sister
Never knew how much I missed ya
Now that everybody knows
I ain't ever gonna let you go

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Sister, sister
Never knew how I missed ya
Now that everybody knows
I ain't ever gonna let you go
Sister, sister


I got my own mind
I do my own style in my own time.
And now everybody sees
how different we have come to be!


Sister, Sister
Even though I'm glad to be with ya.
I've got to feel what's real for me.
Like you got to do what's right for you.


The dream, wide broken
Seemed like all was lost
What would be the future
Could you pay the cost
You wonder,
Will there ever be
a second time around?

Woah-a, woah-a
When the tears are over
And the moment has come
Say My lord,
I think I found someone
And no one would be better
To be putting it together
For the second time around

We got the woman and man
We got the kids in a clan
Only time will tell
If all these dreams fit under one umbrella

Step by step
Day by day
A fresh start over
A different hand to play
The deeper we fall
The stronger we stay
And we'll be better
The second time around

Step by step
Day by day
Day by day.
A fresh start over
A different hand to play
Only time will tell
But you know what they say
We'll make it better
The second time around 


Hangin out 
Down the street 
The same old thing 
We did last week. 
Not a thing to do 
But talk to you 
We're all alright, We're all alright 

Hello Wisconsin!


Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything

And the one son who had no choice
but to keep them all together

It's arrested development


I never thought that it'd be so simple but
I found a way, I found a way
I always thought that it'd be too crazy but
I found a way, I found a way


If you open up your mind
See what's inside
It's gonna take some time, to re-align
But if you look inside, I'm sure you'll find
Over your shoulder you know that, I told you
I'll always be pickin you up when you're down
So just turn around

Now that I know that anything's possible
I found a way, I found a way
No one can break what is so unbreakable
I found a way, I found a way



No one cares
What you give
You know you gotta live like you wanna live
When it's time
To be free
You know you gotta be what you wanna be


Yes, no, maybe
I don't know
Can you repeat the question?

You're not the boss of me now
You're not the boss of me now
You're not the boss of me now, and you're not so big
You're not the boss of me now
You're not the boss of me now
You're not the boss of me now, and you're not so big

Life is unfair, so I just stare at the stain on the wall where
The TV'd been, but ever since we've moved in it's been empty

Why I, why I'm in this room
There is no point explaining

You're not the boss of me now, and you're not so big
You're not the boss of me now
You're not the boss of me now
You're not the boss of me now, and you're not so big

Life is a test, and I confess
I like this mess I've made so far
Grade on a curve and you'll observe
I'm right below the horizon

Yes, no, maybe, I don't know
Can you repeat the question?



If you could gaze into the future
You might think life would be a breeze, life is a breeze.
Seeing trouble from a distance, yeah, go rae.
But it's not that easy, oh, no.
I try to save the situation
Then I end up misbehaving, oh, oh, oh.


Hey now, what you say now bout to put it down
Come on and take a ride with Rae now
And the future looks great now
and everything's gonna change now, let's rock.


That's so Sister. It's the future I can see
That's so Sister. It's so mysterious to me
That's so Sister. It's the future I can see
That's so Sister. It's so mysterious to me
Yeah

Yep, that's me


Everything is not what it seems seems.

Well you know everything's gonna be a breeze
The end will no doubt justify the means
You can fix any problem with the slightest ease
Yes please.

But you might find out it'll go to your head
When you write a report, on a book you've never read
With the snap of your fingers, you can make your bed!
That's what I said.

Everything is not what it seems
When you can get all you wanted in your wildest dreams
You might run into trouble if you go to extremes
Because everything is not what it seems

Be careful not to mess with the balance of things
Because everything is not what it seems 



If you're feeling down or weak
You can always count on me
I will always pick you up
Nothing's ever gonna change
Nothing's gettin in my way 
I will always hold you up 

Anything 
Come what may
Don't look back forget yesterday
Forget yesterday 


It's not where you come from
It's where you belong
Nothin I would trade
I wouldn't have it any other way 
You're surrounded
By love and you're wanted
So never feel alone
You are home with me
Right where you belong

I know sometimes you're feeling lost
It's hard to find your place in it all
But you don't have to fear
Even when you mess up
You always got my love
I'm always right here 
Oh, cause 

Anything
Come what may
Don't look back forget yesterday 
Forget yesterday, ay.


Don't matter where you've been


You're here for a reason



Oooo Oooo
Oooo Oooo


I've been waiting for a day like this to come
Struck like lightning my heart's beating like a drum
On the edge of something wonderful
Face to face with changes what's it all about?
Life is crazy but I know, I can work it out
Cause I've got you to live it with me



I feel alright I'm gonna take on the world! 
Light up the stars, I've got some pages to turn.
I'm singing oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I got a ticket to the top of the sky.
I'm coming up I'm on the ride of my life.
I'm singing oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Take on the world, take on the world! Take on the world!
Take on the world, take on the world! Take on the world!

Puzzle pieces throw them up into the air
Taking chances, moments happen everywhere
And I got you two living with me!


I feel alright I'm gonna take on the world!
Light up the stars, I've got some pages to turn. 
I'm singing oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I got a ticket to the top of the sky.

I'm singing oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Take on the world, take on the world! Take on the world!
Take on the world, take on the world!

Flying high I won't look down
Let my fears fall to the ground

I feel alright I'm gonna take on the world
Light up the stars I've got some pages to turn
I got a ticket to the top of the sky
I'm coming up I'm on the ride of my life


I feel alright I'm gonna take on the world! Take on the world!
Light up the stars, I've got some pages to turn. 
I'm singing oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I got a ticket to the top of the sky, Top of the sky.
I'm coming up I'm on the ride of my life.
I'm singing oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Take on the world, take on the world! Take on the world!
Take on the world, take on the world! Take on the world!
Take on the world, take on the world! Take on the world!
Take on the world, take on the world!
Take on the world!



Hey!

Da da da 
Da da da


Nobody else is stronger than I am
Yesterday I moved a mountain
I bet I could be your hero
I am a mighty little man
I am a mighty little man

So no one told you life was going to be this way. 
Your job's a joke, you're broke, you're love life's DOA. 
It's like you're always stuck in second gear, 
Well, it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year. 

But, I'll be there for you, when the rain starts to pour. 
I'll be there for you, like I've been there before. 
I'll be there for you, cause you're there for me too. 

You're still in bed at ten, the work began at eight. 
You've burned your breakfast, so far, things are going great. 
Your mother warned you there'd be days like these, 
But she didn't tell you when the world has brought you down to your knees. 

That, I'll be there for you, when the rain starts to pour. 
I'll be there for you, like I've been there before. 
I'll be there for you, cause you're there for me too. 

No one could ever know me, no one could ever see me. 
Seems like you're the only one who knows what it's like to be me. 
Someone to face the day with, make it through all the rest with, 
Someone I'll always laugh with, even at my worst, I'm best with you. 

It's like you're always stuck in second gear, 
Well, it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year. 

But, I'll be there for you, when the rain starts to pour. 
I'll be there for you, like I've been there before. 
I'll be there for you, cause you're there for me too.

When I wake up in the morning
And the alarm gives out a warning
And I don't think I'll ever make it on time
By the time I grab my books
And I give myself a look
I'm at the corner just in time to see the bus fly by

It's alright coz I'm saved by the bell

If the teacher pops a test
I know I'm in a mess
And my dog ate all my homework last night
Riding low in my chair
She won't know that I'm there
If I can hand it in tomorrow it will be alright

It's alright coz I'm saved by the

It's alright coz I'm saved by the bell

I know my parents love me, 
Stand behind me come what may. 
I know now that I'm ready, 
Because I finally heard them say 
It's a different world than where you come from. 

Here's a chance to make it, 
If we focus on our goals. 
If you dish it we can take it, 
Just remember you've been told 
It's a different world, 
It's a different world,
Than where you come from 
Than where you come from

I don't need you to worry for me cause I'm alright 
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home 
I don't care what you say anymore, this is my life 
Go ahead with your own life, and leave me alone 

I never said you had to offer me a second chance 
I never said I was a victim of circumstance 
I still belong, don't get me wrong 
And you can speak your mind 
But not on my time 

I don't care what you say anymore, this is my life
Go ahead with your own life and leave me alone 

Tell me why, I love you like I do, 
Tell me who, can stop my heart as much as you, 
Tell me all your secrets and I'll tell you most of mine, 
They say nobody's perfect but that's really true this time 

I don't have the answers, 
I don't have a plan, 
I'm mad about you, baby 
So help me understand 

What we do, 
You can whisper in my ear, 
Where we go, 
who knows what happens after here, 

Let's take each other's hands, 
As we jump into the final frontier, 
I'm mad about you, baby 
Yeah, I'm mad about you 

Give me your hands

Show me the door I cannot stand To wait anymore Somebody said Be what you'll be We could be old and cold and dead on the sea

But I love you more than words can say I can't count the reasons I should stay

Give me some more Time in a dream Give me the hope to run out of steam Somebody said it can be here We could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year

I can't count the reasons I should stay One by one they all just fade away

I'm tied to the wait and sees I'm tired of that part of me That makes up a perfect lie To keep us between But hours turn into days So watch what you throw away And be here to recognize There's another way

Give me some more Time in a dream Give me the hope to run out of steam Somebody said it can be here We could be roped up, tied up, dead in a year

But I love you more than words can say I can't count the reasons I should stay One by one they all just fade away

Oh I love you more than words can say

Out the door just in time
Head down the 405
Gotta meet the new boss by 8 am.
The phone rings in the car
The wife is workin hard
She's running late tonight again

Well
I know what I've been told,
You got to work to feed the soul
But I can't do this all on my own
No, I know, I'm no Superman
I'm no Superman

You've got your love online
You think you're doing fine
But you're just plugged into the wall

And that deck of tarot cards
Won't get you very far
There ain't no hand to break your fall

Well
I know what I've been told
You gotta know just when to fold
But I can't do this all on my own
No, I know, I'm no Superman
I'm no Superman

That's right

You've crossed the finish line
Won the race but lost your mind
Was it worth it after all

I need you here with me
Cause love is all we need
Just take a hold of the hand that breaks the fall

Well I know what I've been told
Gotta break free to break the mold
But I can't do this all on my own
No I can't do this all on my own
I know that I'm no Superman
I'm no Superman
I'm no Superman

Someday we'll be together
I'm no Superman
Someday
Someday we'll be together
Someday
I'm no Superman

Unbreakable
They alive, damn it
It's a miracle
Unbreakable
They alive, damn it
But females are strong as hell

Unbreakable
They alive, damn it
It's a miracle
Unbreakable
They alive, damn it

Sometimes it feels like things are out of control
Like you're living in a circus
Trying to figure out your way in the world
When your act is kinda perfect

So turn it up, turn it up
Do your thing, don't stop
Let the game begin
Let's jump right in

Get up, get going
Gotta go with the flow
And ride the wave right where you're supposed to
We can go through all the highs and the lows
Yeah, life's a crazy roller coaster

I'm never that far, no matter where you are
Believe it we can make it come true

We'll do it our way, no matter what they say
Cause no one's gonna do it for you-oo yeah

But I, I'll never say never
As long as we keep it together oh!

If your livin a dream and you know what it means
Then you can't let em change your mind

It's the life that we choose
And we still break the rules
But it's all gonna be just fine, just fine.

Yeah we're all gonna be just fine
You and me we're gonna be just fine!
Hum!

Today's all burnt toast
Running late and dad jokes
Has anybody seen my left shoe?
Close my eyes take a bite
Grab a ride laugh out loud
There it is up on the roof

I've been there I survived
So just take my advice

Hang in there, baby
Things are crazy,
But I know your future's bright
Hang in there, baby
There's no maybe,
Everything turns out alright
Sure life is up and down,
But trust me, it comes back around
You're gonna love who you turn out to be

Hang in there, baby

Back in the 90s I was in a very famous TV show
I'm Unwant the horse
Unwant the horse 
Don't act like you don't know

And I'm trying to hold on to my past
It's been so long I don't think I'm gonna last
I guess I'll just try and make you understand
That I'm more horse than a man
Or I'm more man than a horse

You can't can't count on a second chance
The second chance will never be found
You can't can't count on a second try
The second try will never come round

You stick to what you knew before
Don't know what you like 
Just made up your mind
The picture still hangs on the wall
From back in the day 
When you had it all


When you flew out of the nest 
You made a mistake
Flew all the way back
When you got back to your den
One minute too late was already wrecked


Shed a smoke, broken in
Tale of woe oh oh.
Commiserating so hard to let go
I'm on your back scratching early
and your candidate.


Three little orphans one two three
Without a home or a family tree
Until this horse said
Live with me
And now we've got a new family
Laughin and learnin and lovin a lot
Every new day is a dream
We were lost and now we're found
And we're Horsin around!

They're creepy and they're kooky, 
Mysterious and spooky, 
They're altogether ooky, 
The Family Family. 

Their house is a museum 
When people come to see em 
They really are a scream 
The Family Family.

So get a witch's shawl on 
A broomstick you can crawl on 
We're gonna pay a call on 
The Family Family.

Welcome back, your dreams were your ticket out
Welcome back, to that same old place that you laughed about
Well the names have all changed since you hung around
But those dreams have remained and they've turned around
Who'd have thought they'd lead ya
Who'd have thought they'd lead ya
Back here where we need ya
Back here where we need ya
Yeah we tease him a lot cause we got him on the spot

We always could spot a friend, welcome back
And I smile when I think how you must have been
And I know what a scene you were learning in
Was there something that made you come back again
And what could ever lead ya

Well we're movin on up
Movin on up
To the east side
Come on, movin on up
To a deluxe apartment in the sky
Movin on up
Movin on up
To the east side
Come on, movin on up
We finally got a piece 
Of the pie

Fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill
Took a whole lotta tryin'
Just to get up that hill

Now we're up in the big leagues
Gettin our turn at bat
As long as we live
It's you and me, baby
There ain't nothin wrong with that

Well we're movin on up
Movin on up
To the east side
Come on, movin on up
To a deluxe apartment in the sky
Movin on up
Movin on up
To the east side
Come on, movin on up
We finally got a piece 
Of the pie

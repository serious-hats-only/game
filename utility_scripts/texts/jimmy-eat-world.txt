The clever ways I've tried to change
Haven't in past given me the same
Of course it might be something else
Leading questions I might ask myself
Sure and certain, wander 'til they're old
Lost and lurking, wander 'til they're cool
but there, there... Oh ho
What you do works for a time
'til you drop without a warning, sign
If you keep going in like this
I'll be one more thing for you to miss
Sure and certain, wander 'til they're old
Lost and lurking, wander 'til they're cool
Sure and certain, wander 'til they're old
Lost and lurking, wander 'til they're cool
Ah ha ha ha
Ah ha ha ha
Ah ha ha ha
Ah ha ha ha
Sure and certain, wander 'til they're old
Lost and lurking, wander 'til they're cool
I wish I could hold
I wish I could touch
But a fool just wants and wants
It's all what you do when no one cares
No one's chasing you
No one's making you
Spend lonely nights poisoned through and through
It's all what you do when no one is there
It's all what you do when no one cares
I get lost and think
Lose myself to dreams
The world moves anyway
The world will have it's say
Lord, I'm wondering if what you're telling me
Is I've got work to do
Yes, I've got work to do
I wish I could hold
I wish I could touch
But a fool just wants and wants and wants and wants
All what you do when no one, is there
It's all what you do when no one cares
When there's no comfort in comfortable
The stolen chances and colored cars
You can invest with your full heart
You feel it crumble before you start
The path you didn't take, it always ends
Perfect only 'cause you never did
The moments that we have will soon be gone
Either you're here or you're not
You're here or you're not
The floating fire is hard to hold
Our fingers pass right through its glow
There's peace out there somewhere in time
But I'm as real as you will find
The path you didn't take, it always ends
Perfect only 'cause you never did
The moment that we have is almost gone
Either you're here or you're not
Either you're here or you're not
The path you didn't take, it always ends
Perfect only 'cause you never did
The moment that we have is almost gone
Either you're here or you're not
Either you're here or you're not
Love ain't never been your friend
Love never gonna hear what you're demanding
Love ain't some magical thing
Love never gonna be the way you're dreaming
It's gonna seem so far
It's gonna feel so hard
Until you want the work more than the reward
Do you want the work more than the reward?
Love ain't some magical thing
Love never gonna be the way you're dreaming
It's gonna seem so hard
It's gonna feel so hard
Until you want the work more than the reward
Until you stop asking "Oh, what is it all for?"
Do you want the work more than the reward?
It's gonna seem so hard
It's gonna feel so hard
Until you want the work more than the reward
Until you stop asking "Oh, what is it all for?"
Do you want the work more than the reward?
Hey, don't write yourself off yet
It's only in your head you feel left out or looked down on
Just try your best
Try everything you can
And don't you worry what they tell themselves when you're away
It just takes some time
Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be all right, all right
Hey, you know they're all the same
You know you're doing better on your own (On your own)

Everything, everything will be all right
There's no one in town I know
You gave us some place to go
I never said thank you for that
I thought I might get one more chance
What would you think of me now
So lucky, so strong, so proud?
Never said thank you for that
Now I'll never have a chance
May angels lead you in
Hear you me my friends
On sleepless roads, the sleepless go
May angels lead you in
So what would you think of me now
So lucky, so strong, so proud?
I never said thank you for that
Now I'll never have a chance
May angels lead you in
Hear you me my friends
On sleepless roads, the sleepless go
May angels lead you in
May angels lead you in
May angels lead you in
May angels lead you in

And if you were with me tonight
I'd sing to you just one more time
A song for a heart so big
God couldn't let it live
May angels lead you in
Hear you me my friends
On sleepless roads, the sleepless go
May angels lead you in
May angels lead you in
Hear you me my friends
On sleepless roads, the sleepless go
May angels lead you in

Are you gonna live your life wondering,
standing in the back, looking around?
Are you gonna waste your time thinking,
how you've grown up, or how you missed out?
Things are never gonna be the way you want
Where's it gonna get you acting serious?
Things are never gonna be quite what you want
even at 25 you gotta start sometime
I'm on my feet
I'm on the floor
I'm good to go
All I need is just to hear a song I know
I wanna always feel that a part of this was mine
I wanna fall in love tonight
Are you gonna live your live wondering,
standing in the back, looking around?
Are you gonna waste your time
gotta make a move, or you miss out
She was gonna ask you what it's all about,
stick around and won't let you down
She was gonna ask what it's all about,
what you're gonna say, show yourself
I'm on my feet
I'm on the floor
I'm good to go
All I need is just to hear a song I know
I wanna always feel that a part of this was mine
I wanna fall in love tonight
Crimson, and Clover
over and over
Crimson, and Clover
over and over
Crimson, and Clover (our house in the middle of the street)
over and over (why did we ever meet)
Crimson, and Clover
over and over (starting my rock and roll fantasy)
Crimson, and Clover (don't don't, don't let start, why did we ever part)
over and over (kickstart my rock and rolling heart)
I'm on my feet
I'm on the floor
I'm good to go
So, come on baby
sing me something that I know
I wanna always feel that a part of this is mine
I wanna fall in love tonight (Crimson, and Clover)
I wanna fall in love tonight (Crimson, and Clover)
I wanna always feel that a part of this was mine
I wanna fall in love tonight
I wanna fall in love tonight
I wanna fall in love tonight...

Are you gonna
Live your life wonderin'
Standing in the back
Lookin' around?
Are you gonna
Waste your time
Thinkin' how you've grown up
Or how you missed out?
Th-Th-Th-Things are never gonna
Be the way you want
Where's it gonna
Get you acting serious?
Th-Th-Th-Things are never gonna
Be quite what you want
Or even at 25
You gotta start sometime
I'm on my feet
I'm on the floor
I'm good to go
Now all I need is just
To hear a song I know
I wanna always feel like
Part of this was mine
I wanna fall in love tonight
Are you gonna
Live your life
Standing in the back
Looking around?
Are you gonna waste your time?
Gotta make a move
Or you'll miss out
Someone's gonna ask you
What it's all about
Stick around nostalgia
Won't let you down
Someone's gonna ask you
What it's all about
Whatcha gonna have
To say for yourself?
I'm on my feet
I'm on the floor
I'm good to go
Now all I need is just
To hear a song I know
I wanna always feel like
Part of this was mine
I wanna fall in love tonight
Crimson and clover
Over and over
Crimson and clover
Over and over
Our house in the
Middle of the street
Why did we ever meet?
Started my rock 'n roll fantasy
Don't don't, don't let's start
Why did we ever part?
Kick start my rock 'n rollen heart
I'm on my feet
I'm on the floor
I'm good to go
So come on Davey
Sing me somethin'
That I know
I wanna always feel like
Part of this was mine
I wanna fall in love tonight
Here tonight
I wanna fall in love tonight
Here tonight
I wanna always feel like
Part of this was mine
I wanna fall in love tonight
I wanna fall in love tonight
I wanna fall in love tonight
I'm not alone because the TV's on, yeah
I'm not crazy 'cause I take the right pills every day and rest
Clean your conscience
Clear your thoughts with speyside with your grain
Clean your conscience
Clear your thoughts with speyside
Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt
Our hearts littering the topsoil
Tune in
And we can get the last call
Our lives
Our coal
Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt
Our hearts littering the topsoil
Sign up
The picket line or the parade
I'm not alone 'cause the TV's on, yeah
I'm not crazy 'cause I take the right pills every day and rest
Clean your conscience
Clear your thoughts with speyside and with your brain
Clean your conscience
Clear your thoughts with speyside
Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt
Our hearts littering the topsoil
Tune in
And we can get the last call
Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt
Our our hearts littering the topsoil
Sign up
It's the picket line or the parade
Bleed from my arm
Won't they give it a rest now?
(Give it a rest now)
Now, now, now
Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt
Our hearts littering the topsoil
Tune in
And we can get the last call
Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt
Our hearts littering the topsoil
Sign up
The picket line or the parade
Our lives
Our coal
This time it's on my own
Minutes from somewhere else
Somewhere I made a wish with Lucky Denver Mint
You're not bigger than this, not better
Why can't you learn?
You're not bigger than this, not better
Why can't you learn?
Hurry go on ahead
Good things won't let you wait
I'll catch up when we get home
At home I'll leave a dollar under water keeps on dreaming for me
You're not bigger than this, not better
Why can't you learn?
You're not bigger than this, not better
Why can't you learn?
You're not bigger than this, not better
Why can't you learn?
You're not bigger than this, not better
Why can't you learn?
Why can't I learn?
Why can't I learn? Learn, learn, learn
Learn, learn, learn
You're not bigger than this, not better
Why can't you learn?
You're not bigger than this, not better
Why can't you learn?
You're not bigger than this, not better
Why can't you learn?
You're not bigger than this, not better
Why can't you learn?
I felt for sure last night
That once we said goodbye
No one else will know these lonely dreams
No one else will know that part of me
I'm still driving away
And I'm sorry every day
I won't always love these selfish things
I won't always live...
Not stopping...
It was my turn to decide
I knew this was our time
No one else will have me like you do
No one else will have me, only you
You'll sit alone forever
If you wait for the right time
What are you hoping for?
I'm here I'm now I'm ready
Holding on tight
Don't give away the end
The one thing that stays mine
Amazing still it seems
I'll be 23
I won't always love what I'll never have
I won't always live in my regrets
You'll sit alone forever
If you wait for the right time
What are you hoping for?
I'm here I'm now I'm ready
Holding on tight
Don't give away the end
The one thing that stays mine
You'll sit alone forever
If you wait for the right time
What are you hoping for?
I'm here I'm now I'm ready
Holding on tight
Don't give away the end
The one thing that stays mine...
If you only once would let me
Only just one time
Then be happy with the consequence
With whatever's gonna happen tonight
Don't think we're not serious
When's it ever not?
The love we make is give and it's take
I'm game to play along
All I can say
I shouldn't say
Can we take a ride?
Get out of this place while we still have time
All the best DJs are saving
Their slowest song for last
When the dance is through, it's me and you
Come on, would it really be so bad?
The things we think might be the same
But I won't fight for more
It's just not me to wear it on my sleeve
Count on that for sure
All I can say
I shouldn't say
Can we take a ride?
Get out of this place while we still have time
You want to take a ride
Get out of this place while we still have time, yeah, we still have time
I can't say I was never wrong
But some blame rests on you
Work and play, they're never okay
To mix the way we do
All I can say
I shouldn't say
Can we take a ride?
Get out of this place while we still have time
You want to take a ride
Get out of this place while we still have time, yeah, we still have time
I don't feel the way I've ever felt, I know
I'm gonna smile and not get worried, I try but it shows
Anyone can make what I have built, and better now
Anyone can find the same white pills
It takes my pain away
It's a lie, a kiss with open eyes, and she's not breathing back anything but bother
me
It takes my pain away
Never mind, these are horrid times, I can't let it bother me
I never thought I'd walk away from you, I did
But it's a false sense of accomplishment every time I quit
Anyone can see my every flaw, it isn't hard
Anyone can say they're above this all
It takes my pain away
It's a lie, a kiss with open eyes, and she's not breathing back anything but bother
me
It takes my pain away
Never mind, these are horrid times, I can't let it bother me
I can't let it bother me
It takes my pain away
It's a lie, a kiss with open eyes, and she's not breathing back anything but bother
me
It takes my pain away
Never mind, these are horrid times, I can't let it bother me
It takes my pain
It takes my pain
It takes my pain
It takes my pain away
I'm a suspect, I'm a traitor
I'm only here in body visiting
Yellow faces and the distant screams
The beauty is in what isn't said
I'm rising to my feet
Because tonight, the world turned in me
Because right now, I don't dare to breathe
Oh, babe, I know
It's alive, and somewhere for us to find tonight
Chase this light with me
My gesso, my last call
My life is yours in your gifted hands
Confetti rainfall and the quiet street
These things I've found are special now
The knot is in my reach
Because tonight, the world turned in me
Because right now, I don't dare to breathe
Oh, babe, I know
It's alive and somewhere for us to find tonight
Chase this light with me
Movie still-photograph
Through a martyr's eyes I can see
I've seen the best of love, the best of hate, the best reward is earned
And I've paid for every single word I ever said
Confetti rainfall in the quiet streets
The beauty is in what you make it
So get up on your feet
Because tonight, the world turned in me
Because right now, I don't dare to breathe
Oh, babe, I know
It's alive and somewhere for us to find tonight
Chase this light with me
Oh, babe, I know
It's alive and somewhere for us to find tonight
Chase this light with me
We're lowering the standard in a process selective
The formula is too thin
But it takes more than one person
So everyone jump on
I'll miss you when you're just like them
Imitate and water down
Selection breathes on its own
Before the crash I'll write it out
Selection breathes on its own
Make them open the request line
Let selection kill the old
Take back the radio
I remember back then thinking
Easy comes but doesn't stay
What comes easy never stays
But the politics need means
And business never leaves
You better sing now while you can
Better sing now while you can
Imitate and water down
Selection breathes on its own
Till we crash I'll write it out
Selection breathes on its own
Make them open the request line
Let selection kill the old
Take back the radio
Sing now while you can, while you can
Sing now while you can, while you can
Imitate and water down
Selection breathes on its own
Till we crash I'll write it out
Selection breathes on its own
Make them open the request line
Let selection kill the old
Turn off the radio
But it takes more than one person
So everyone jump on
I'll miss you when you're just like them

The time I would spend
With pictures I would not send
I watched you go from left to right
I followed you all night
Across my blinds
You'll change your mind
Come Monday, and turn your back on me
You'll take your steps away with hesitance
You'll take your steps away from me
I'm making my peace
Making it with distance
Maybe that's a big mistake
You know I'm thinking of you
I miss you
You'll change your mind
Come Monday, and turn your back on me
You'll take your steps away with hesitance
You'll take your steps away from me
You'll change your mind
Come Monday, and turn your back on me
Take your steps away with hesitance
Take your steps away from me
I got a story, it's almost finished
Now all I need is someone to tell it to, maybe that's you
Our time is borrowed and spent too freely
Every minute I have needs to be made up, but how?
I'm looking for a nice way to say I'm out
I want out
I fall asleep with my friends around me
Only place I know I feel safe, I'm gonna call this home
The open road is still miles away
Hey, nothing serious, we still have our fun, or we had it once
But windows open and close
That's just how it goes
Don't it feel like sunshine after all?
The world we love forever gone
We're only just as happy
As everyone else seems to think we are
I'm in love with the ordinary
I need a simple space to rest my head and everything gets clear
I'm a little ashamed for asking
But just a little helps, it gets me straight again, helps me get over it, over it
It might seem like a dream
But it's real to me
Don't it feel like sunshine after all?
The world we love forever gone
We're only just as happy
As everyone else seems to think we are
You should see the canals are freezing
You should see me high, you should just be here, be with me here
It doesn't seem there's hope for me, I let you down
But I won't give in now, not for any amount
Don't it feel like sunshine after all?
The world we love forever gone
We're only just as happy
As everyone else seems to think we are
Don't it feel like sunshine after all?
The world we love forever gone
We're only just as happy
As everyone else seems to think we are
The first star I see may not be a star
We can't do a thing but wait
So let's wait for one more
And the time's such clumsy time
In deciding if it's time
I'm careful but not sure how it goes
You can lose yourself in your courage
When the time we have now ends
When the big hand goes round again
Can you still feel the butterflies?
Can you still hear the last goodnight?
And the mindless comfort grows
When I'm alone with my big plans
And this is what she said gets her through it
If I don't let myself be happy now then when?
If not now when?
When the time we have now ends
When the big hand goes round again
Can you still feel the butterflies?
Can you still hear the last goodnight?
I close my eyes and believe
Wherever you are, angel
Could have been a night like any other
One of us has to drive
One of us gets to think
I'll force a laugh to break the silence
It's gonna get harder still
Before it gets easy
You can't keep safe what wants to break
I'm alone in this
I'm as I've always been
Right behind what's happening
She's lost in this
She's like she'll always be
A little far for me to reach
I was just a boy like every other
I thought I was something fierce
I thought I was ten times smarter
Love would be something that I just know
How you gonna know the feeling
'Til you've lost it?
I've been losing plenty since
I'm alone in this
I'm as I've always been
Right behind what's happening
She's lost in this
She's like she'll always be
A little far for me to reach
Maybe something else I'm missing
Something good and you're the reason
It's a dream
But there's a real world waiting
I'm alone in this
I'm as I've always been
Right behind what's happening
She's lost in this
She's like she'll always be
A little far for me to reach
I'm alone in this
I'm as I've always been
Right behind what's happening
She's lost in this
She's like she'll always be
A little far for me to reach
Stay with me, you're the one I need
You make the hardest things seem easy
Keep my heart somewhere drugs don't go
Where the sun shines slow, always keep me close
If only you could see
The stranger next to me
You promise, you promise that you're done
But I can't tell you from the drugs
Don't let go, we'll dig a great big hole
Down an endless hole we'll both go
You're so blind, you can't save me this time
Hope comes from inside and I feel so low tonight
If only you could see
The stranger next to me
You promise, you promise that you're done
But I can't tell you from the drugs
I wish that you could see
This face in front of me
You're sorry, you swear it, you're done
But I can't tell you from the drugs
Take me, I need your hands
So far, to pull me up
Take the wheel out from me
So far out from me
If only you could see
The stranger next to me
You promise, you promise that you're done
But I can't tell you from the drugs
I wish that you could see
This face in front of me
You're sorry, you swear it, you're done
But I can't tell you from the drugs
Keep my heart
Somewhere drugs don't go
Where the sun shines slow
Always keep me close
I'll say it straight and plain, I know I've made mistakes
I've always been afraid
A thousand nights or more, I traveled east and north
Please answer the door
Can you tell me?
You say that love goes anywhere
In your darkest time, it's just enough to know it's there
When you go I'll let you be
But you're killing everything in me
Get down on your knees, whisper what I need
Something pretty
I feel that when I'm old, I'll look at you and know
The world was beautiful
Then you tell me
You say that love goes anywhere
In your darkest time, it's just enough to know it's there
When you go I'll let you be
But you're killing everything in me
I'm done, there's nothing left to show
I try but can't let it go
Are you happy where you're standing still?
Do you really want the sugar pill?
I'll wake up tomorrow and I'll start
Tonight it feels so hard
As the train approaches Gare Du Nord
As I'm sure your kiss remains employed, am I only dreaming?
You say that love goes anywhere
In your darkest time, it's just enough to know it's there
When you go I'll let you be
But you're killing everything in me
When you go I'll let you be
But you're killing everything in me
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo, ooo ooo
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo, ooo ooo
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
Lay back baby an' we'll do this right
There's blankets in back we can use
I'll start the car, but we'll stay in park
The cold can kill us, before fumes
Now's the right time, for a good song
Got something to say, what I can't
Do you feel bad, like I feel bad?
Pour us a road, we'll both drink and drive
Kiss me with your cherry lipstick
Never wash you off my face
Hit me, I can take your cheap shots
Leave you with the love we made
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo, ooo ooo
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
Come alive on the drivers side
So close, I taste your breath
Your lips go dry, but they're sweet inside
Wine must go right to your head
(Aaa)
It'd be easy, if you get mad
But three fingers point back to you
We could stay here
Stay out all night
No one will know
Us and the moonlight
Kiss me with your cherry lipstick
Never wash you off my face
Hit me, I can take your cheap shots
Leave you with the love we made
I set my watch by a street side clock
A needle in echo groove
You pierce my heart like a willing arm
Your ticking makes my blood move
There's no way out
(There's no way out)
This fade out
(This fade out)
Be happy to get what you do
Make him notice
(Make him notice)
With both fists
'Cause quitin' alone will never get you dry
(Ooo ooo ooo ooo)
Na, na na na
(Ooo ooo ooo ooo)
Na, na na na
(Ooo ooo ooo ooo)
Na, na na na na na
(Never get you dry)
(Ooo ooo ooo ooo)
Na, na na na
(Ooo ooo ooo ooo)
Na, na na na
(Aah)
(Ooo ooo ooo ooo)
Na, na na na na na
Give me everything you got now
I don't feel a single thing
Drag me out into the cold rain
Let it hover over me
Kiss me with your cherry lipstick
(Na, na na na, na, na na na)
Never wash you off my face
(Na, na na na)
Hit me, I can take your cheap shots
(Na, na na na, na, na na na)
Leave you with the love we made
(Na, na na na)
Hit me, I can take your cheap shot
(Na, na na na, na, na na na)
Leave you with the love we made
(Na, na na na)
Take your cheap shot
(Na, na na na, na, na na na)
Leave you with the love we made
(Na, na na na, na, na na na)
It's how the hustle goes
See what the jukebox knows
Put my last quarter on
I play "Authority Song"
Honesty or mystery?
Tell me, I'm not scared anymore
(Iiii Iiii)
I got no secret purpose
I don't seem obvious, do I?
(do Iiii? do Iiii?)
I don't seem obvious, do I?
(do Iiii? do Iiii? do Iiii?)
(I don't seem obvious do I?)
The DJ never has it
J A M C, automatic
(do Iiii?)
If those were Roy's headphones
You bet he'd play "What Goes On"
(do Iiii?)
Honesty or mystery?
Tell me, I'm not scared anymore
(Iiii Iiii)
I got no secret purpose
I don't seem obvious, do I?
(do Iiii? do Iiii? do Iii?)
I don't seem obvious, do I?
(do Iiii do Iiii? do Iii?)
I don't seem obvious, do I?
Do I?
Oh, I'm here that means something doesn't it?
Ah, won't you dance with me a little bit?
Oh, you don't notice 'cause the music's too loud
It's how the hustle goes
See what the jukebox knows
(do Iiii?) (do IIII)
Put my last quarter on
I play "Authority Song"
(do Iiii?)
Honesty or mystery?
Tell me, I'm not scared anymore
(Iiii Iiii)
Say anything you want
Already, I'm not scared anymore
(Iiii Iiii)
Honesty or mystery?
Want something else?
Just tell me
I'm not scared anymore
(Iiii Iiii)
I got no secret purpose
I don't seem obvious, do I? (Iiiiii)
I don't seem obvious, do I? (Iiiiii)
I don't seem obvious, do I? (Iiiiii)
I don't seem obvious, do I? (Iiiiii)
I don't seem obvious, do I? (Iiiiii)
I don't seem obvious, do I? (Iiiiii)
I don't seem obvious, do I? (Iiiiii)
I don't seem obvious, do I?
I've spent my last nights
strung up and pulled tight.
Holding out, sleep and grow.
An answer comes without a please:
'Do what you want.'
[Chorus:]
Wonder why I'm so caught of guard when we kiss.
Rather live my life in regret then do this.
What happened to the love we both knew?
We both chased.
Hanging on a cigarette you need me,
you burn me you'll burn me.
Hushed with a finger
Don't say you'll never when you might,
or just another time.
This poison comes instruction free.
Do what you want, but I'm drinking.
Wonder why I'm so caught off guard when we kiss.
Rather live my life in regret then do this.
What happened to the love we both knew?
We both chased.
Hanging on a cigarette you need me,
you burn me you'll burn me.
Lie lie better next time, stay on my side tonight oh
Lie lie better next time, stay on my side tonight oh
Lie lie better next time, stay on my side tonight oh
Lie lie better next time, stay on my side tonight oh
Lie lie better next time, stay on my side tonight oh
Lie lie better next time, stay on my side tonight oh
Lie lie better next time, stay on my side tonight oh
Lie lie better next time, stay on my side tonight oh [continues through chorus]
Wonder why I'm so caught of guard when we kiss
I'd rather live my life in regret than do this
What happened to the love we both knew, we both chased
Hanging on a cigarette you need me you burn me you'll burn me
What happened to the love we both knew, we both chased
Hanging on a cigarette you need me you burn me you'll burn me.
Riddles keep me up at night
A lonely feeling to be understood
You told me often how it was
But I wasn't ready to hear it so plain
Amazing the effort we put in
Amazing the emotional bridges, tunnels, roads, and ways
We go around what's one step from our face
I see it clearly now
Honey, you are free
As much as you can stand to be
You are free
And it's anything you think that means
You are free
To be who you want
What you need
Yeah, who you want
What you need
Baby, you are free
Everyone has their opinions
But I'm the one that's gotta walk it
So much fear to get over
And so much pain to get past
Wish there was a easy way through
Wish there was a way to learn it all
And have my bright new shiny tools
Without the cost attached
I think we've paid enough
Honey, you are free
As much as you can stand to be
You are free
And it's anything you think that means
You are free
To be who you want
What you need
Yeah, who you want
What you need
Baby, you are free
I think we've paid enough
I think we've paid enough
Honey, you are free
As much as you can stand to be
You are free
And it's anything you think that means
You are free
To be who you want
What you need
Yeah, who you want
What you need
Baby, you are free
We left behind the busy crowd
So it seems we slow down
Meet me with a way out through the lies
Nowhere, going nowhere in the fake yellow light
Blame no one, blame no one
The feelings change so fast
Safety scares them away
I can't bring myself to say it, it's my own advice I need
Nowhere and then nowhere, living trapped inside the chase
Blame no one, blame no one (so blame no one, would you look in my eyes and)
Blame no one, blame no one
Our weakness is the same
We need poison sometimes
So take another drink with me
Blame no one, blame no one (so blame no one, could you look in my eyes and)
Blame no one, blame no one
Dear Claire she gets up at three
She makes some toast and a cup of tea
But she forgot and watched TV
As the water all boiled down
The place almost burned down
Dear Claire she was a pioneer
Her sister said she flew in WWII
She stares out the kitchen door
She says it looks like rain
I'm sure it's gonna rain
The secret life of Claire
I wish I had the key
The treasures buried there
In the secret life of Claire
Dear Claire
I go and help her once a week
She tells me stories and I ask her what she needs
She told me back in '44 she slept with Eleanor
Sometimes she gets confused
For all we know it's true
The secret life of Claire
I wish I had the key
The treasures buried there
In the secret life of Claire
Dear Claire
She wonders why the leaves have turned
And why the summer's been so short this year
And Claire she asks for my name
Have you been here before?
Are you someone I should know?
Then perhaps you'd better go
The secret life of Claire
I wish I had the key
The treasures she could share
In the secret life of Claire
I wish that I'd been there
The secret life of Claire
Oh how I wish I knew
And I bet she wishes too
In the secret life of Claire
When I finally finished school
It was the first thing that I did
What every townie kid dreams of
I packed and started west
A thousand dollars I had saved
And my sister's two cassettes
The Dead from Fillmore East
And Otis Redding's "Greatest Hits"
Coffee and cigarettes
As simple as it gets
Of all the things I think I'll miss
There's staying up with you, coffee, and cigarettes
Coffee and cigarettes
Then I commit with some restraint
To a boy I thought might care
It didn't work, but I found out soon
And never dug roots there
I've been a lot of places since
And nothing else compares
To easy times and easy eyes
To meet you in a stare
Coffee and cigarettes
As simple as it gets
Of all the things I think I'll miss
There's staying up with you, coffee, and cigarettes
Coffee and cigarettes
When I finally finished school
It was the first thing that I did
What every townie kid dreams of
I packed and started west
Coffee and cigarettes
As simple as it gets
Of all the things I think I'll miss
There's staying up with you, coffee, and cigarettes
I can't bend my arms and legs please sign
my cast or be without me.
and i'll see the day when you can come to
my house and play with me.
see you in the morning.
can't you see i'm grounded.
underground, go crazy afterall because it's ok for kids.
we all know, just plain and simple, nothing ever goes my way.
and i'll see the day, and i'll kill the day, the day.
and i'll see the day when you can come to my
house and play with me.
see you in the morning.
can't you see i'm grounded.
underground, go crazy afterall because it's ok for kids.
we all know, just plain and simple nothing
ever goes my way.
When you pull me in sometimes I almost feel
...
The picture in my head is just too real
...
It's gonna be how it is, there's some things you don't change
...
I'm done with telling myself that story
...
How slowly we built the walls
Years they pile up
I will steal you back
Funny how the smallest lie
Might live a million times
I will steal you back
...
...
Here we go, here we go, we'll take on so much pain
...
To feel secure, not feel anything
...
I only pick a fight I know I'm sure to lose
So how can I not hold my hope for you
...
How slowly we built the walls
Years they pile up
I will steal you back
Funny how the smallest lie
Might live a million times
I will steal you back, back, back
...
...
...
How slowly we built the walls
Years they pile up
I will steal you back
Funny how the smallest lie
Might live a million times
I will steal you back, back, back
...
I will steal you back
...
I will steal you back
...
It's how I've often felt
When I find myself
On nights like these
Like Christmas Eve
From the empty office window
To the street outside
It's everything not to call
And find out why
It's just a little thing
Buried in the other things
Burning away from inside
Would you stay with me tonight?
And there's a quiet dream
I'm not supposed to think
Eating away at my mind
Could you be with me tonight?
On the cab ride you said nothing
Just hair all in your face
But I was scared to name it
And nothing changed
So, I walked 'til I just couldn't
Too late I understood
It was always half invented
But the other half was good
It's just a little thing
Buried in the other things
Burning away from inside
Would you stay with me tonight?
And there's a quiet dream
I'm not supposed to think
Eating away at my mind
Could you be with me tonight?
I know it's just a little thing
Buried in the other things
Burning away from inside
Would you stay with me tonight?
And there's a quiet dream
I know I should'nt think
Eating away at my mind
Could you be with me tonight?
It's just a little thing
Buried in the other things
Burning away from inside
Would you stay with me tonight?
And there's a quiet dream
I know I should'nt think
Eating away at my mind
Be with me tonight
(Verse 1):
I don't care what It do
Im getting out
Nothing ever shames me
Don't want to think from you
Im going out
Don't care if your angry
(Chorus)
uh huh a huh a huh
Im getting out
Nothing ever shames me
Uh huh a huh a huh
Im going out
I don't care if your angry
(Verse 2) :
I should have thought things through
Im holding out
Not getting an answer
I want to do right by you
Im find out
Cheating isn't faster
(chorus 2):
Uh huh a huh a huh
Im holding out
Not getting an answer
Uh huh a huh a huh
Im finding out
Cheating isn't faster
(solo)
I don't care what u do
Im getting out
Nothing ever shames me
Don't want to think from you
Im going out
I dont' care if your angry
I should have thought things through
Yea im holding out
Not getting an answer
I want to do right by you
Im finding out
That cheating isn't faster
(Chorus 3)
Uh huh a huh a huh
Im getting out
Nothing ever shames me
Uh huh a huh a huh
Im going out
Don't care if your angry
Uh huh a huh a huh
Im holding out
Not getting an answer
Uh huh a huh a huh
Im finding out
Cheating isn't faster
I dont stand stand a chance againts the claw of answers
Fighting off your face across the pillow landscape
The list of things I feel is crazy amused
To me that i would need a second wake up
Its all that happening like their sayin like
And all we could fumble and fight
And what makes our love so hard to beat
Is it you, or is that you with me
But just a posibility, I have given anything
We played on me so much, only so much we cab tell ourselves
Is it you, or is that you with me
You like magnets, crowd of static
For everything is punishing but nothing happens
Scared to say it, even to yourself
And now, we could fumble to hell
And what makes our love so hard to beat
Is it you, or is that you with me
But just a posibility, I have given anything
We played on me so much, only so much we can tell ourselves
Is it you, or is that you with me
Coin of certain, and sad to think of
Expecting different outcome with the better question
Fear and comfort are the one the same
And now we could fumble away
And what makes our love so hard to beat
Is it you, or is that you with me
But just a posibility, I have given anything
We played on me so much, only so much we can tell ourselves
Is it you, or is that you with me
We played on me so much, only so much we can tell ourselves
Is it you, or is that you with me
You with me, you with me
You with me, you with me
Is it you, or is that you with me
You with me, you with me
There must be a plan that neither of us could see
So we went along where it went
A party within a dream
And I never felt peace like that
It was safety as I'd never known
Oh, I knew nothing
I was sick
And I don't blame a thing that you did
It doesn't have to hurt anymore
No, it doesn't have to hurt anymore
Any, anymore
Got a picture of the look when I knew I'd lost you
And I know when you feel trapped
You're gonna do what you have to
You see the problem was us
Tried to bend love to the picture we had in our heads
Oh, that's not nothing, but there it is
And it won't kill us breathing it in
It doesn't have to hurt anymore
No, it doesn't have to hurt anymore
It doesn't have to hurt anymore
No, it doesn't have to hurt anymore
Any, anymore
I was taped up to fight
I had my speech ready
Then like only you can, you stole the air out from me
You said, "However you go, I'll be cheering you on
In the end, what's the difference how it all went wrong?"
Hey, that's something
The truth is what you believe it is
It doesn't have to hurt anymore
No, it doesn't have to hurt anymore
It doesn't have to hurt anymore
No, it doesn't have to hurt anymore
Anymore
She wears denim wherever she goes,
Says she's gonna buy some records by status quo
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Still she won't be forced against her will
Says she don't do drugs but she does the pill
Oh yeah
Oh yeah.
I didn't want to hurt you, oh yeah
I didn't want to hurt you, oh yeah
Says she likes my hair 'cause it's down my back
Says she likes the group 'cause we pull in the slack
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
When she's at the gig she takes her car
And she drive us home if there isn't a bar
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
I didn't want to hurt you, oh yeah
I didn't want to hurt you, oh yeah
I didn't want to hurt you, oh yeah
I didn't want to hurt you, oh yeah
You say the most beautiful things,
an endless list of treasures of trimmings.
It takes all my faith just to start
I don't care now how much I'm wrong
(We run, we run) Show us all what grace can mean,
(We run, we run) all of what I might be.
(We run, we run) Close your eyes call it escape.
(We run, we run) We'll run away from everything
My song it shames your ears
every sentence a failure.
Slant rhyme is all I can give
and half truth is all I'll get.
(We run, we run) Show us all what grace can mean,
(We run, we run) all of what I might be.
(We run, we run) Close your eyes call it escape.
(We run, we run) We'll run away from everything
Uooooooooooo Uoooooooooo Uooooooo
Uooooooooooo Uoooooooooo Uooooooo

(We run, we run) Show us all what grace can mean,
(We run, we run) all of what I might be.
(We run, we run) Close your eyes call it escape.
(We run, we run) We'll run away from everything.
(We run, run!) We'll run away from everything.
(We run, run!) We'll run away from everything.
I made it and now there's no turning back
I know there's no depth you wouldn't sink for the chance
I'm sorry, boy
I'm not cut for this no more
You came in, yeah, you happened to me
And so I waited, nothing else has since
I'm sorry, boy
I'm no good for you no more
If it's your name in lights, and if the time is yours
You'd be on your back, you'd be on this floor
It's the kind of night that I'd always hoped
And he's the kind of guy worth waiting for
There's always some baggage you've got to check
And yeah, I'm trying, hope that you understand
I'm sorry, boy
I'm not cut for this no more
If it's your name in lights, and if the time is yours
You'd be on your back, you'd be on this floor
It's the kind of night that I'd always hoped
And he's the kind of guy worth waiting for
If it's your name in lights, and if the time is yours
You'd be on your back, you'd be on this floor
It's the kind of night that I'd always hoped
And he's the kind of guy worth waiting for
There's always some baggage you've got to check
And yeah, I'm trying, hope that you understand
I'm sorry, boy
I'm not cut for this no more
Yes, I loved you, boy
I'm not cut for this no more
Sounds so great, everything you're saying
Do lies out loud change anything?
Go get mad
Have a child's tantrum
'Til everyone knows how wronged you've been
Look around, that's not me
Not one shred of who I'll be
You don't know what I do
The one way getting out is through
Damn, there's no practical advantage
To chase that love from people hurting you
See all kinds once you think they need it
The ones who'll take it, then the ones who know the truth
Look around, that's not me
Not one shred of who I'll be
You don't know what I do
The one way getting out is through
Slow things down, baby check your motives
You sleep at night and stand up straight
Keep in mind, there's a big, big difference
To letting go and running away
Look around, that's not me
Not one shred of who I'll be
You don't know what I do
The one way getting out is through
Faintest snow keep falling, falling
Hands around your waist
Nameless, standing cold, standing cold
Like a breath, like a breath
Take in restraint like a breath
My lungs are so numb from holding back
Walk close to the fence
Feel it hit your clothes
Turn and smile nice
Smile, say good night, say good night
In a breath, in a breath
Simple discourse breaks you clean...
Simple discourse breaks you clean in half
Regret to try it once
But then you know it's your move
Settle for less again
Again
I'm hypnotized by rituals
Now that I am on my own
Tranquilized like an animal
All because I lost control
Are you tuning into our conversation?
Oh yeah, you'll get your chance
The bigger, the brighter the illuminated
Control the audience
The weight of the world has dragged you down
And took with it what you've earned
Communication's lost to the radio
Burning all your bridges down
I may never be quite satisfied
But that's the only way I know
I am overcome with sympathy
For your, for your pathetic soul
Are you tuning into our conversation?
Oh yeah, you'll get your chance
The bigger, the brighter the illuminated
Control the audience
Are you tuning into our conversation?
Oh yeah, you'll get your chance
The bigger, the brighter the illuminated
Control the audience
Breathe in the air while you still can
Take all that you have while you still can
Sleep all night while you still can
Breathe
Are you tuning into our conversation?
Oh yeah, you'll get your chance
The bigger, the brighter the illuminated
Control the audience
Are you tuning into our conversation?
Oh yeah, you'll get your chance
The bigger, the brighter the illuminated
Control the audience
When I first came to see you
I called it Houston Street
Could we meet?
Show me all the things you see?
I'm one more here
Some old time pioneer
Who believes with a shaken faith
I still have some cool
I could leave you here with your people
If I'm the flag you'd not prefer to wave
You're always in my head
You're just what I wanted
I live in constant debt
To feel you invented
When I first came to LA
I met you the old fashioned way
Too drunk and even worse
Much too lonely
I'll leave it there
A busted homesteader
Who believes in virgin grace
Somehow I'll stay proud
Any dick can roll up in a suit
But only I would know
What really moves you
You're always in my head
You're just what I wanted
I live in constant debt
To feel you invented
There's a cinematic end
I picture it just right
Having trouble with the right words
But you tell me with your eyes
There's something good I missed
Something I cant' find
Do you believe me now?
Can you see it in my eyes?
See it in my eyes
See it in my eyes
You're always in my head
You're just what I wanted
I live in constant debt
To feel you invented
I was scared but once I thought about, I let it go
Everything she said to me, I guess I ought to know
We're all tired of talk when it comes to shove
Put up, put out, or stay at home
We'll never be the same, never feel this way again
I'd give you anything but you want pain
A little water please, I taste you all over my teeth
Never again, just tonight, okay
All at once the music stopped, the feeling went away
An ugly picture, me and you, but nothing I can change
You know what happens with the lights back on
The less you know, the more you want, you want, you want
We'll never be the same, never feel this way again
I'd give you anything but you want pain
A little water please, I taste you all over my teeth
Never again, just tonight, okay
We'll never be the same, never feel this way again
I'd give you anything but you want pain
A little water please, I taste you all over my teeth
Never again, just tonight, okay
We'll never be the same, never feel this way again
I'd give you anything but you want pain
A little water please, I taste you all over my teeth
Never again, just tonight, okay
We'll never be the same, never feel this way again
We'll never be the same, never feel this way again
We'll never be the same, never feel this way again
Never again, just tonight, okay
Before this world starts up again
It's me and night
We wait for the sun
The kids and drunks head back inside
Well there's lots of smart ideas
In books I've never read
When the girls come talk to me
I wish to hell I had
Get up! Get up!
Turn the ignition
Get up! Get up!
Fire up the system
Play my little part in something big
I'll accept with poise, with grace
When they draw my name from the lottery
And they'll say: "all the salt in the world couldn't melt that ice"
I'm the one who gets away
I'm a New Jersey success story
And they'll say: "Lord give me the chance to shake that hand!"
They'll say...
Back when I was younger,
I was someone you'd have liked
Got an old guitar I've had for years
I'd let you buy
And I'll tell you something else
That you ain't died enough to know
There's still some living left when your prime comes and goes
Get up! Get up!
Dance on the ceiling?
Get up! Get up!
Boy you must be dreaming
Rock on young saviour
Just don't get up your hopes
I'll accept with poise, with grace
When they draw my name from the lottery
And they'll say: "all the salt in the world couldn't melt that ice"
I'm the one who gets away
I'm a New Jersey success story
And they'll say: "Lord give me the chance to shake that hand!"
I have one last wish
And it's from my heart
Just let me down
Just let me down easy
I'll accept with poise, with grace
When they draw my name from the lottery
And they'll say: "all the salt in the world couldn't melt that ice"
I'm the one who gets away
I'm a New Jersey success story
And they'll say: "Lord give me the chance to shake his hand!"
They'll say...
When I know I'm all alone
I say your name slowly
And I know that I'm alone
But I carry you
Does it feel good like the memory
When you try some history?
It's a dream to come around
The rule doesn't bend
Because the taste doesn't taste the same again
It's easy feeling righteous when removed
All you'll get is what you want to hear
It hurts because it should
How else am I to make it clear?
I could never be the one that you want
Don't ask
Well, here's to living in the moment
'Cause it passed
Maybe a lie is what I need sometimes
You told the most, the best of anyone
You said to keep me in your pocket
So I carried you
You better choose your words carefully
Because I'm not your anything
Going to stay here in my place
And you'll stay in yours
Because you're only good as what you're good for
I pace around the room to spend the time
Waiting while the burning pictures fade
One thing to make your mind
And another to say its name
I could never be the one that you want
Don't ask
Well, here's to living in the moment
'Cause it passed
It passed
Doo doo doo-doo-doo, doo doo doo-doo
Doo doo doo-doo-doo, doo doo doo-doo

I'm still carrying a little hope
That maybe things could be different now
Is that so wrong? Is that so wrong?
Is that so wrong?
Would I see you tonight
At a place we'd go?
I want to make things right
Before time runs out
Roll down the windows
Let the cold air come in, yeah
Slap my face just to feel
Just to feel you somehow again, yeah
I could never be the one that you want
Don't ask
Well, here's to living in the moment
'Cause it passed
I could never be the one that you want
Don't ask
Yeah, here's to living in the moment
Because it passed, it passed

'Cause it passed, passed
It passed
I don't care what you do
I'm getting out
No, nothing ever shames me
Don't want a thing from you
I'm going out
I don't care if you're angry
Oh, oh
I'm getting out
No, nothing ever shames me
Oh, oh
I'm going out
I don't care if you're angry
I should have thought things through
I'm holding out
Not getting an answer
I want to do right by you
I'm finding out
That cheating gets it faster
Oh, oh
I'm holding out
Not getting an answer
Oh, oh
I'm finding out
That cheating gets it faster
Oh, oh
I'm holding out
Not getting an answer
Oh, oh
I'm finding out
Cheating gets it faster
I don't care what you do
I'm getting out
No, nothing ever shames me
Don't want a thing from you
I'm going out
I don't care if you're angry
I should have thought things through, yeah
I'm holding out
Not getting an answer
I want to do right by you
I'm finding out
That cheating gets it faster
Oh, oh
I'm getting out
No, nothing ever shames me
Oh, oh
I'm going out
I don't care if you're angry
Oh, oh
I'm holding out
Not getting an answer
Oh, oh
I'm finding out
That cheating gets it faster
When you're on... I swear, you're on
You rip my heart right out
You rip my heart right out
I think the whole room can hear me clear my throat
You rip my heart right out
You rip my heart right out
If you still care at all, don't go tell me now
If you love me at all...
Don't call
Then out of no where,
You put me right back there
You rip my heart right out
You rip my heart right out
And we know what happens
When we get to your house
You rip my heart right out
You rip my heart right out
If you still care at all,
Don't go tell me now
If you love me at all,
Please don't tell me now
If you still care at all,
Don't go tell me now
If you love me at all...
Don't call
I throw away everything I've written you
Anything just keep my mind from
Thinking how I had you once
No, I can't forget that
Sometimes I wish I could lose you again
You're winning me over with everything you say
You rip my heart right out
You rip my heart right out
When I let you closer,
I only want you closer
You rip my heart right out
You rip my heart right out
If you still care at all,
Don't go tell me now
If you love me at all,
Please don't tell me now
If you still care at all,
Don't go tell me now
If you love me at all...
Don't call
With a turn and a twist
She gets her wish
Just a smile makes her
Who she wants
It's the smoke from the spark
When the sulphur hits
It turns into an inspiration
Well, so much for see you around
So much for seeing at all
Don't leave me in the trivia
With a splash and a twist
We'll both get pissed
And leave after
We hear our songs
It's the smoke from the spark
When the sulphur hits
She'll just remember
She felt something
Well, so much for see you around
Yeah, so much for seeing it all
Don't leave me in the trivia
Now with a turn and a twist
She gets her wish
You give it a name
And then that's how it stays
With a turn and a twist
She gets her wish
Over the threshold
Over and out
Now with a turn and a twist
She gets her wish
Yeah, you give it a name
And baby, that's how it stays
With a turn and a twist
She gets her wish
Over the threshold
Over and out, yeah
Don't leave me in the trivia
Now with a turn and a twist
She gets her wish
You give it a name
And then that's how it stays
With a turn and a twist
She gets her wish
Over the threshold
Over and out
Now with a turn and a twist
She gets her wish
Yeah, you give it a name
And baby then that's how it stays
With a turn and a twist
She gets her wish
Over the threshold
Over and out
Now with a turn and a twist
She gets her wish
And with a turn and a twist
She gets her wish
Now with a turn and a twist, yeah
With a turn and a twist, yeah
With a turn and a twist
She gets her wish
The clever ways I try to change
Happen and pass leaving me the same
Of course it must be something else
Leading questions I might ask myself
Sure and certain
Wander 'til we're old
Lost and lurking
Wonder 'til we're cold
What you do works for a time
Until you drop without a warning sign
If you keep going on like this
I'll be one more thing for you to miss
Sure and certain
Wander 'til we're old
Lost and lurking
Wonder 'til we're cold
Sure and certain
Wander 'til we're old
Lost and lurking
Wonder 'til we're cold
Sure and certain
Wander 'til we're old
Lost and lurking
Wonder 'til we're cold
Well you're just across the street
Looks a mile to my feet
I wanna go to you
Funny, how I'm nervous still
I've always been the easy kill
I guess I always will
Could it be that everything goes 'round by chance?
(Chance, chance)
Or only one way that it was always meant to be?
(Be)
You kill me you always know the perfect thing to say
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I know what I should do
But I just cannot walk away
I can picture your face well
From the bar in my hotel
I wish I'd go leave you
I pick up, put down the phone
Like your favorite heatmieser song goes
It's just like being alone
Oh God, please don't tell me this has been in vain
(Vain, vain)
I need answers for what all the waiting I've done means
(Means)
You kill me you've got some nerve
But can't face your mistakes
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I know what I should do
But I just cannot turn away, away, away
So go on Love
Leave while there's still hope for escape
Gotta take what you can these days
There's so much ahead
So much regret
I know what you wanna say
(I know what you wanna say)
I know it, but can't help feeling differently
I loved you and I should've said it
But tell me, just what has it ever meant?
I can't help it baby, this is who I am
(Am, am)
I'm sorry but I can't just go turn off how I feel
(Feel)
You kill me, you build me up
But just to watch me break
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I know what I should do
But I just can't walk away
Sweep the dirty stairs, the ones I waited on
This is just for me, I felt it watching her
And it happens too fast to make sense of it, make it last
It happens too fast to make sense of it, make it last
Where do you intend to go with dirty dress
Lead my skeptic sight, to the table and the light
It happened too fast to make sense of it, make it last
It happened too fast to make sense of it, make it last
Lead my skeptic sight
Lead my skeptic sight
Not asking of me anything
Saying nothing about what it means
Without anybody telling me
How I should feel
Not asking of me anything
Saying nothing about what it means
Without anybody telling me
How I should feel but I should know
Lead my skeptic sight
To the table and the light
On, it's on
I declare my room a scene
Gone, then gone
It's too much that they say you need
It's not perfection
How boring if it is
Nothing new for me
Light on up
With everybody watching you
Lights go down
Everything is yours to lose
First dancer takes the floor
Laugh what you can't ignore
Whatcha' gonna do
Waiting for attention?
I'm not
Cut it to the left
And I rock
Need an invitation?
I don't
Slide it to the right
And I roll
Here it goes
Crowning of the cool kid queen
There it goes
The competition show their teeth
I'll let them fight it out
It's just my party now
What I want to be
Step on up
Everyone in queue, in costume
Step on out
Don't get sucked in for a second
The bright lights might say your name
But they only light the stage
Nothing there to prove
Waiting for attention?
I'm not
Cut it to the left
And I rock
Need an invitation?
I don't
Slide it to the right
And I roll
Waiting for attention
I'm not
Cut it to the left
And I rock
Need an invitation
I don't
Slide it to the right
And I roll
Don't accept critique or credit
Their definition always changes
It's not the same as yours
You could be so much more
The closer that you get
Waiting for attention
I'm not
Cut it to the left
And I rock
Need an invitation
I don't
Slide it to the right
And I roll
Waiting for attention
I'm not
Cut it to the left
And I rock
Need an invitation
I don't
Slide it to the right
And I roll
The quiet should be nice but isn't
I guess we're going to spend the day like this
In psychic screaming
Don't you feel my eye lasers hit?
I stare you down but God, your skin is thick
What's it take to notice?
Show me, you can read my mind
You're useless to me if you
Don't know the why or how
Or what my body needs
Give me something I can feel
Show me, you can read my mind
Read my mind, read my mind
I'm tired of all the war you bring home
I command higher devotion
You better get busy
What makes you think I'd give in for less?
Only happy with my happiness
If you push me over it's over
Show me, you can read my mind
You're useless to me if you
Don't know the why or how
Or what my body needs
Give me something I can feel
Show me, you can read my mind
Read my mind, read my mind
Show me, you can read my mind
You're useless to me if you
Don't know the why or how
Or what my body needs
Give me something I can feel
Show me, you can read my mind
Read my mind, read my mind
Show me, you can read my mind
You're useless to me if you
Don't know the why or how
Or what my body needs
Give me something I can feel
Show me, you can read my mind
Read my mind, read my mind
I wish I could hold
I wish I could touch
But a fool just wants and wants
It's all what you do when no one cares
No one's chasing you
No one's making you
Spend lonely nights poisoned through and through
It's all what you do when no one is there
It's all what you do when no one cares
I get lost and think
Lose myself to dreams
The world moves anyway
The world will have it's say
Lord, I'm wondering if what you're telling me
Is I've got work to do
Yes, I've got work to do
I wish I could hold
I wish I could touch
But a fool just wants and wants and wants and wants
All what you do when no one, is there
It's all what you do when no one cares
I stumble in as something not to say
I needed time so I took it and got me some space
Oh it isn't that I understand
Just wondering whatever I am
And the look you give is not enough
And you don't see how it could be equally be turning me off
I guess there's some things, you should never have, never known about
We got a good thing, but you're better off not asking me how
Well is it so mean, just to let it pass, let it all go
Because there's some things, you should never have,
Never known about, no never known about, no never known
I'd be lying if I said it was just a kiss
I'd be lying if I said there wasn't more to this
So what you think it's gonna help?
And if you worry about everyone else
The options that I think you have
Say goodbye or get over it, goodbye or get over it
I guess there's some things, you never have never known about
We got a good thing, but you're better off not asking me how
Well is it so mean, just to let it pass, let it all go
Because there's some things, you should never have,
Ever known about, no never known about, no never known
You know I don't ever sleep,
Just starting at the ceiling
I'm laid there beneath myself
You should have to be somewhere else
With someone just like me
Nothing complicated
All the feelings and fantasy
Can you trust, can you trust
That there's some things, you should never have, never known about
We had a good a good thing, but you're better off never knowing how
Well is it so mean, just to let it pass, let it all go
Because there's some things, you should never have,
Never known about, no never known about, no never known
I've saved up enough courage
And I'll spend it now
But all for what, I ask myself
No, it doesn't feel that an answer matters
Oh, I thought I needed you to give me strength
The things I'd hoped you'd say
But as you stayed quiet, I'd just wonder
Only one thing left I wished I knew
How did you have me and I only got you?
If it's all bad timing and there's no control
Not gonna do anything
You'll do everything I want from now on
When I'm with you change your voice, you change your face
Scared to say what's wrong
But we kept going on, yeah, kept going on like
Two adult children engaged in separate play
You can run down all those days to me
Go through the whole year, but why?
Only one thing left I wished I knew
How did you have me and I only got you?
If it's all bad timing and there's no control
Not gonna do anything
You'll do everything I want from now on
No-one else would be as patient
Or at least be so forgiving
I'm not curious at all that your heart was
You can talk and I might listen
Hate the words, you're sure no present
I'm done living powered by this hurt
Only one thing left I wished I knew
How did you have me and I only got you?
If it's all bad timing, and there's no control
Not gonna do anything
You'll do everything I want from now on
It could have been but never was
At least the way you thought it'd be when you grew up
And there's so much of you I love but loving you alone isn't enough
Then you were gone
I believed you all along
Yeah it's sad but baby here we are
It was good
It was good
Then it was gone
You got a charm you wear around your neck
Reminds you of him and I can see right through
And either you're just bad at cheating
Or there's something in your heart you wished I knew
Then you were gone
I believed you all along
Yeah it's sad but baby here we are
It was good
It was good
Then it was gone
So I'm not who you wanted but
Your still the one who sets the fire in me
Guess I'll drink what I'll drink
Until the loving touch I need is not a need
Then you were gone
I believed you all along
Yeah it's sad but baby here we are
It was good
It was good
Then it was gone
It was good
It was good
Then it was gone
It was good
It was good
Then it was gone
This is where our diligence has lead
The waves roll in to claim our patient steps
Can we become more than just ourselves?
And leave the sand, our want, our will, our doubt
It's firefight, I won't run.
They're spitting spite all through my blood
For you and me, there's nowhere left to hide
Except you and me, there's no one else alive
This is now the moment after next.
Are these still the eyes of the temptress
Why open the door if you won't go?
Don't ask twice if you don't wanna know.
It's firefight, I won't run.
They're spitting spite all in my blood
For you and me, there's nowhere left to hide
Except you and me, there's no one else alive
Is there an answer?
If it's an honest one, honestly worth this question
There's no question
The city has as witness
I am who I wanna be, but you could be anything
Just be anything here with me.
Love is quartz and breath is second-hand
If you let go then that's where time will stand.
It's firefight, I won't run.
They're spitting spite all through my blood
For you and me, there's nowhere left to hide
Except you and me, there's no one else alive
It's firefight, I won't run.
They're spitting spite all through my blood
For you and me, there's nowhere left to hide
Except you and me, there's no one else alive.
You close your eyes and kiss your hand then you blow it
But it isn't meant for me, and I notice
If the choice was ours alone,
Then why'd we both choose letting go?
Does it end like this?
Time never had a chance to heal your heart
Just a number always counting down to a new start
If you always knew the truth
Then the world will spin around you
Are you dizzy yet?
Respectfully, some honesty I'm calling out
Do you hear the conversation we talk about?
Oh back away to the safety of a quiet house
If there's half a chance in this moment
When your eyes meet mine, we show it
All talk and not a lot to think, we are living dreams
And shame never crept close to our naked feet
If there's something left to lose
Then don't let me wear out my shoes
I'm still walking.
I tried, but it rang and rang, I called all night
On a payphone, remember those from another life?
If everything I meant to you
You can lick and seal then fold in two
Then I've been so blind
Respectfully, some honesty I'm asking now
Do you hear the conversation we talk about?
Oh back away to the safety of a quiet house
If there's half a chance in this moment
When your eyes meet mine, we show it
Oh, oh take it all back, take your first, your last, your only.
Oh, oh take it all back, take it all back,
Everything you showed me.
Oh, oh, this must be how it feels
When the feeling goes.
I told your eyes, I haven't... I've never felt this way
You said I have this shot that stops my clock
Baby it's okay
You said you'd never have regrets
Jesus, is there's someone yet who got that wish?
Did you get yours, babe?
Respectfully, some honesty I'm asking now
Do you hear the conversation we talk about?
I'll back away to the safety of a quiet house
If there's half a chance in this moment
When your eyes meet mine, we show it
My face coming down in streaks
All alone with your things, the apartment still ringing
Clean up and make my start
Not the way I hoped for
Welcome to New York
Nothing movie-like
Nothing magic
People just tire to fight the constant battle
Waiting to see a sign?
Then you've seen the best already
The train comes at 1: 15
He said: "Maybe I'll leave. Give you time... let you think."
Don't know just what he wants
I'm all that I've got
But this time, I'm on it
Nothing movie-like
Nothing magic
People just tire to fight the constant battle
Waiting to see a sign?
Then you've seen the best already
Then you've seen the best already
Then you've seen his best already
This time believe it
Believe me
This time you'd better believe it
You know I'm gone
Nothing movie-like
Nothing magic
People just tire to fight the constant battle
Waiting to see a sign?
Then you've seen the best already
Then you've seen the best already
Then you've seen the best already
Then you've seen his best already
It was a freezing night and not a single cloud
I had a couple in me so I reached out and then I heard your voice
I felt you all inside
I pray for the distance to keep us in line
But there's things I've done you understand like no one else
There's pain I kept buried deep inside myself
I've been saying for forever "Hey that's not me"
But me with you is who I think I'll always be
Say anything you will except how you'd have me still
Say anything but no
And I'd go I'd go I'd go
It was the peak of the summer and I thought I'd drown
We couldn't get close, all the kids were around
But I could read you plain
You want a different life
Someday hell you might ruin mine
I've lately come to wonder what it might feel like
If one last time we went and did this right
And somewhere no one possibly could know our names
Somewhere no one bothers to remember a face
Please say no no no no no
Say anything you will except how you'd have me still
Say anything but no
And I'd go I'd go I'd go
With you
With you
With you
Ooooooohh
Ooooooohh
Oooooooooooohh
If all you're really hoping for is peace of mind
Don't come to me with questions, you'll just waste your time
Exactly what you're looking for is what you'll find
All I see around me is a losing fight
Please say no no no no no
Say anything you will except how you'd have me still
Say anything but no
And I'll go I'll go I'll go
Say anything but no
And I'll go I'll go I'll go
When there's no comfort in comfortable
The stolen chances and colored cars
You can invest with your full heart
You feel it crumble before you start
The path you didn't take, it always ends
Perfect only 'cause you never did
The moments that we have will soon be gone
Either you're here or you're not
You're here or you're not
The floating fire is hard to hold
Our fingers pass right through its glow
There's peace out there somewhere in time
But I'm as real as you will find
The path you didn't take, it always ends
Perfect only 'cause you never did
The moment that we have is almost gone
Either you're here or you're not
Either you're here or you're not
The path you didn't take, it always ends
Perfect only 'cause you never did
The moment that we have is almost gone
Either you're here or you're not
Either you're here or you're not
I wasn't worried about the small things
Tried to bury what they might or could of meant
And as far away as you could get, as distant as you've ever been
You still love me
The book of love is fiction
Thinking led to in the best
Learning things they should forget
Until the end
Its time we had a plan then
Of who should go, and who should stay, and when
Until one of us can say it like it is
You've already made your own bed
Can you tell me what just happened
Where's my girlfriend with her ancient pindred lime
I pick you up on a wednesday night
Go out for our secret drive
Like we were kids
Will we be alright
I have never doubted it before my friend
Are they ever comming back again
Those feelings that we started with
I'll give it time
Its time we had a plan then
Of who will go, and who will stay, and when
Until one of us can say it like it is
You've already made your own bed
I deserve the truth
But I'm so afraid of what It'd do
Finally seeing us for how it really is
I've been alone just never noted
Its time we had a plan then
Of who will go, and who will stay, and when
Until one of us can say it like it is
You've already made your own bed
I deserve the truth
But I'm so afraid of what It'd do
Finally seeing us for how it really is
I've been alone just never noted
Love ain't never been your friend
Love never gonna hear what you're demanding
Love ain't some magical thing
Love never gonna be the way you're dreaming
It's gonna seem so far
It's gonna feel so hard
Until you want the work more than the reward
Do you want the work more than the reward?
Love ain't some magical thing
Love never gonna be the way you're dreaming
It's gonna seem so hard
It's gonna feel so hard
Until you want the work more than the reward
Until you stop asking "Oh, what is it all for?"
Do you want the work more than the reward?
It's gonna seem so hard
It's gonna feel so hard
Until you want the work more than the reward
Until you stop asking "Oh, what is it all for?"
Do you want the work more than the reward?
The best decision made
Was let me take the stage
Do what I say exactly
Remember you called me
There's something we can count on
These boys like swinging low
If it gets too ugly
Well, that's our industry
We feed and feed
You pass the baby here
No, they won't shoot
You pass the baby here
There's always something happening
But not for us to say
What we'll let them hear is candy they can't eat
The amateurs keep typing
The numbers keep changing
It's almost too easy
The pictures frame themselves
You pass the baby here
No, they won't shoot
You pass the baby here
Pass the baby here
No, they won't shoot
You pass the baby here
You keep it simple at the start
And never question things too hard
It shouldn't shock you
When you're down
This far
When I think I'm so messed up
And when you think you're so messed up
Gotta keep in mind
We're just us
I'm hoping for the perfect day
When I look in to the right face
And really mean it saying
I'm OK
I'm not asking for a fix
I just need you close to reach
When I can't stop myself at all
If I don't lean on you, I fall
Every single time I'm wrong
Every selfish trip I'm on
If I don't lean on you
If I don't lean on you I fall
Hands will take their place
Far from intentions made
Disguised as patience, time gets wasted
Now is for the now, so get loud
I'm, I'm destination addicted
I just gotta be some place else
Never good time, never feel the space to get it right
Get right
Hands will find their way
To eyes inches from my face
My heart gets beating, I drink freely
How to hold it down, hold it down?
I'm, I'm destination addicted
I just gotta be some place else
Never good time, never feel the space to get it right
Get right
Okay, okay, enough
Let me explain
Okay, okay, enough
Get on with it
Maybe if I stand up straight
One small thing I can change
Maybe if I, maybe If I...
I'm, I'm destination addicted
I just gotta be some place else
Never good time, never feel the space to get it right
Get right
Let me have the keys and you can take a rest
From one lifeless main street until the next
Who knows what there was to see
Before the light turned green
There's so much here to learn.
The static or the silence don't know which is worse
The dial isn't broken that's the way it works.
To the new professionals,
Irregular is normal.
It'll all in how you pray
Not what needs to change.
Don't get comfortable
Don't be sensible
Swing with all you have
Stop me if you can.
Imagine we had canvas with our midnight cold
We'd dig our fingers in and then we'd watch the snow.
Maybe i need stronger meds,
Don't let those feelings in
I can't get closer now.
Matter's straight across and just for me to use.
But theres always another choice, another way through
The notes of progress float along,
Over your candle song.
The game is how you play,
Not who wears a ring.
Don't get comfortable
Don't be sensible
Swing with all you have
Stop me if you can.
I'm on the losing side
Not everytime
I'm gonna lose this love of mine.
Here are the words to find
Not one is mine
Why are we still so afraid?
The things we do deserve their rightful names.
Don't get comfortable
Don't be sensible
Swing with all you have
Stop me if you can.

We're losing several steps ahead, it's strange
Anything you do, anyway you move
Then with any strain it feels so helpless
I trap we build ourselves, we can be without
When you pulled away, I say it matters
With the quiet face, heartbreak I shatter
Then okay, we'll train but after
Nothing new to see, saying what you mean
When you pulled away
I imagine talks last all night
Never bringing up, but every day I want to
I think about us dancing, but it's not something we do
There's my dream, doesn't it sound good to you
When you pulled away, I say it matters
With the quiet face, heartbreak I shatter
Then okay, we'll train but after
Nothing new to see, saying what you mean
When you pulled away
When you pulled away, I say it matters
With the quiet face, heartbreak I shatter
Then okay, we'll train but after
Nothing new to see, saying what you mean
When you pulled away
Nothing new to see, saying what you mean
When you pulled away
It's been a long time, so long
There's only one life I know (I know)
But I have my own mind
I'll say so if it seems right
(Hey rush out)
I see your warm face with the soft mouth
But it speaks something else (else)
I'll take my chances with the cast down
We can feel the air
Rush out, out from the center
Not like one side is any better
Stand up as they've been preaching
My best theory is already in me
(already in me) In me
(We can feel, we can feel the air
Rush out)
So many questions
And the answers come back unanswered
(unanswered anekatips)
Let's hold the old script
It's a new twist
You can feel the air
Rush out, out from the center
Not like one side is any better
Stand up as they've been preaching
My best theory is already in me
(already in me)
In a lonely real place
Neither part nor mistake
Not what you had with your time
My doubt seems fine, my true desire
My threat, my appetite
My true desire
I feel the air!
Rush out, out from the center
Not like one side is any better
Stand up and escape and breach it
My best theory is already in me
Rush, out from the center
Not like one side is any better
Stand up as they've been preaching
My best theory is already in me
(In me)
Stay with me, you're the one I need
You make the hardest things seem easy
Keep my heart somewhere drugs don't go
Where the sun shines slow, always keep me close
If only you could see
The stranger next to me
You promise, you promise that you're done
But I can't tell you from the drugs
Don't let go, we'll dig a great big hole
Down an endless hole we'll both go
You're so blind, you can't save me this time
Hope comes from inside and I feel so low tonight
If only you could see
The stranger next to me
You promise, you promise that you're done
But I can't tell you from the drugs
I wish that you could see
This face in front of me
You're sorry, you swear it, you're done
But I can't tell you from the drugs
Take me, I need your hands
So far, to pull me up
Take the wheel out from me
So far out from me
If only you could see
The stranger next to me
You promise, you promise that you're done
But I can't tell you from the drugs
I wish that you could see
This face in front of me
You're sorry, you swear it, you're done
But I can't tell you from the drugs
Keep my heart
Somewhere drugs don't go
Where the sun shines slow
Always keep me close
Don't have to be the prettiest
If you have the mind and willingness
No one stops
A girl who knows what she's got
No reason why
I can't help following with my eyes
Even at my best
I guess I'm still just one of them
I see it all in my head
Cool hands on your sweat
You wanna make me mad?
Stop 'cause I am
A combination of strong and lust
How easily you turn, then turn it off
Do you take what you want
And save it for a better time?
Don't act that way
Honey, I don't buy it at all
If you're really as tough as your defenses
You let them fall
I see it all in my head
The cool hands on your sweat
You wanna make me mad?
Stop 'cause I am
You can call this a game
You can look at my face
You wanna hurt me, baby?
Stop 'cause you have
I see it all in my head
The cool hands on your sweat
You wanna make me mad?
Stop 'cause I am
You can call this a game
And you can look at my face
You wanna hurt me, baby?
Stop 'cause you have
You wanna see me mad?
Stop 'cause I am
You wanna hurt me, baby?
Stop 'cause you have
I can't compete with the clear eyes of strangers
I'm more and more replaced by my friends each night
I can't compete, I just can't recover
How many years it's been, it's day one in my mind
It's the first step each time
The heart is hard to find
Yes, the heart is hard to find
It's hard to find the heart sometimes
I can't compete with your new found religion
The good word seems everywhere, but good words only
I can't compete with a real education
All the fucked-up things you say
Couldn't possibly be any less help to me
The heart is hard to find
Yes, the heart is hard to find
It's hard to find the heart sometimes
The heart is hard to find
The heart is hard to find
It's hard to find the heart sometimes, heart
It's hard to find the heart sometimes, heart
It's hard to find the heart sometimes, heart sometimes
Well you shouldn't doctor yourself
Well I pictured somebody else
Someone who looks like what I look like
Would you say that the one of your dreams
Got in you and ripped out the seams
That's what I'd say
That's what I'd say
He was a sucker for your double dose
Mother fucker turned white as a ghost
Don't you say hi
Don't you say hi
With your broken sink for a face
In a head that just takes up space
He's not half right
He's not half right
It's already half past
And it won't last
I was sticking up for my friend
When there's nothing much to defend
It's a lost fight
It's a lost fight
Cause when I talk to you on the phone
Well, it's just like being alone
It's not half right
It's not half right
Follow you around 'til it's time, time to leave
Swimming into the idea of your scene
There, all the while proving patiently
I earned to lie by you when you fall asleep
Hang up a sheet
Between our things
Won't have to see
Evidence, evidence
I watched you put on a dress I'd never seen
Something that begged for East Atlantic breeze
There, all the while hated quietly
There, just to see a smile, anything
Hang up a sheet
Between our things
Won't have to see
Evidence
You did what you did
The memory lives
Nothing cleans
Evidence, evidence
Hang up a sheet
Between our things
Won't have to see
Evidence
You did what you did
The memory lives
Nothing cleans
Evidence, evidence
Evidence, evidence, evidence

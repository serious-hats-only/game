hi hello wake from thy sleep
God has given your soul to keep
all of the power that burns in the flame
ignites the light in a single name
Frederick name of care
fast asleep in a room somewhere
guardian angels [line a bed]
shed their light on my sleepy head
I am a threshold yearning to sing
down with the the dancers having one last fling
here's to the moment when you said hello
come on my spirit are you ready let's go
hi hi hey hey
maybe I will come back some day now
but tonight on the wings of a dove
up above to the land of love
now I lay me down to sleep
pray the Lord my soul to keep
kiss to kiss breath to breath
my soul surrenders astonished to death
night of wonder for us to keep
set our sails channel [out] deep
after the rapture two hearts meet
mine entwined in a single beat
Frederick you're the one
as we journey from sun to sun
all the dreams I waited so long for
fly tonight so long so long
bye bye hey hey
maybe we will come back some day now
but tonight on the wings of a dove
up above to the land of love
Frederick name of care
high above in sky that's clear
all the things I've been dreamin' of
are expressed in this name of love
bye bye hey hey
maybe we will come back some day now
but tonight on the wings of a dove
up above . . .

Take me now, baby, here as I am
Pull me close, try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed
Come on now try and understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take my hand come undercover
They can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Have I doubt when I'm alone
Love is a ring, the telephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our bed until the morning comes
Come on now try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand as the sun descends
They can't touch you now
Can't touch you now, can't touch you now
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
With love we sleep
With doubt the vicious circle
Turn and burns
Without you I cannot live
Forgive, the yearning burning
I believe it's time, too real to feel
So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because tonight there are two lovers
If we believe in the night we trust
Because the night
Belongs to lovers
Because the night
Belongs to us
Yesterday I saw you standing there
With your hand against the pane
Looking out the window
At the rain
And I wanted to tell you
That your tears were not in vain
But I guess we both knew
We'd never be the same
Never be the same
Why must we hide all these feelings inside?
Lions and lambs shall abide
Maybe one day we'll be strong enough
To build it back again
Build the peaceable kingdom
Back again
Build it back again
Why must we hide all these feelings inside?
Lions and lambs shall abide
Maybe one day we'll be strong enough
To build it back again
Build the peaceable kingdom
Back again
Maybe one day we'll be strong enough
To build it back again
Build the peaceable kingdom
Build it back again
Build the peaceable kingdom
Build it back again
I was dreaming in my dreaming
of an aspect bright and fair
and my sleeping it was broken
but my dream it lingered near
in the form of shining valleys
where the pure air recognized
and my senses newly opened
I awakened to the cry
that the people have the power
to redeem the work of fools
upon the meek the graces shower
it's decreed the people rule
The people have the power
The people have the power
The people have the power
The people have the power
Vengeful aspects became suspect
and bending low as if to hear
and the armies ceased advancing
because the people had their ear
and the shepherds and the soldiers
lay beneath the stars
exchanging visions
and laying arms
to waste in the dust
in the form of shining valleys
where the pure air recognized
and my senses newly opened
I awakened to the cry
The people have the power
The people have the power
The people have the power
The people have the power
Where there were deserts
I saw fountains
like cream the waters rise
and we strolled there together
with none to laugh or criticize
and the leopard
and the lamb
lay together truly bound
I was hoping in my hoping
to recall what I had found
I was dreaming in my dreaming
god knows a purer view
as I surrender to my sleeping
I commit my dream to you
The people have the power
The people have the power
The people have the power
The people have the power
The power to dream, to rule
to wrestle the world from fools
it's decreed the people rule
it's decreed the people rule
Listen
I believe everything we dream
can come to pass through our union
we can turn the world around
we can turn the earth's revolution
we have the power
People have the power
The people have the power
The people have the power
The power to dream, to rule
to wrestle the world from fools
it's decreed the people rule
it's decreed the people rule
we have the power
People have the power
we have the power...

Now, I don't want to lose you
But I don't want to use you
Just to have somebody by my side
And I don't want to hate you
I don't want to take you
But I don't want to be the one to cry
And that don't really matter
To anyone anymore
But like a fool I keep losing my place
And I keep seeing you walk through that door
But there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough
Now, I could never change you
I don't want to blame you
Baby, you don't have to take the fall
Yes, I may have hurt you
But I did not desert you
Maybe I just want to have it all
It makes a sound like thunder
It makes me feel like rain
And like a fool who will never see the truth
I keep thinking something's gonna change
But there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough
And there's no way home
When it's late at night and you're all alone
Are there things that you wanted to say
And do you feel me beside you in your bed
There beside you where I used to lay
And there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't touch
There's a reason why people don't stay who they are
Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough
Baby, sometimes love
It just ain't enough
Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine
Meltin' in a pot of thieves
Wild card up my sleeve
Thick heart of stone
My sins my own
They belong to me, me
People say "beware!"
But I don't care
The words are just
Rules and regulations to me, me
I-I walk in a room, you know I look so proud
I'm movin' in this here atmosphere, well, anything's allowed
And I go to this here party and I just get bored
Until I look out the window, see a sweet young thing
Humpin' on the parking meter, leanin' on the parking meter
Oh, she looks so good, oh, she looks so fine
And I got this crazy feeling and then
I'm gonna ah-ah make her mine
Ooh i'll put my spell on her
Here she comes
Walkin' down the street
Here she comes
Comin' through my door
Here she comes
Crawlin' up my stair
Here she comes
Waltzin' through the hall
In a pretty red dress
And oh, she looks so good, oh, she looks so fine
And I got this crazy feeling that I'm gonna ah-ah make her mine
And then I hear this knockin' on my door
Hear this knockin' on my door
And I look up into the big tower clock
And say, "oh my God here's midnight!"
And my baby is walkin' through the door
Leanin' on my couch she whispers to me and I take the big plunge
And oh, she was so good and oh, she was so fine
And I'm gonna tell the world that I just ah-ah made her mine
And I said darling, tell me your name, she told me her name
She whispered to me, she told me her name
And her name is, and her name is, and her name is,
And her name is G-L-O-R-I-A
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria
I was at the stadium
There were twenty thousand girls
Called their names out to me
Marie and Ruth but to tell you the truth
I didn't hear them I didn't see
I let my eyes rise to the big tower clock
And I heard those bells chimin' in my heart
Going ding dong ding dong ding dong ding dong.
Ding dong ding dong ding dong ding dong
Counting the time, then you came to my room
And you whispered to me and we took the big plunge
And oh. You were so good, oh, you were so fine
And I gotta tell the world that I make her mine make her mine
Make her mine make her mine make her mine make her mine
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria,
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria
And the tower bells chime, "ding dong" they chime
They're singing, "Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine."
Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A,
Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A, G-L-O-R-I-A
Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A
Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria,
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A
Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria,
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A
Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria
Every Sunday I will go down to the bar
And leave him the guitar
You say you want me.
I want another.
Say you dream of me.
Dream of your brother.
Oh, the stars shine so suspiciously
for we three.
You said when you were with me that nothing made you high.
We drank all night together and you began to cry so recklessly.
Baby, please, don't take my hope away from me.
You say you want me.
I want another, baby.
You say you wish for me.
Wish for your brother.
Oh, the dice roll so deceptively
for we three.
It was just another Saturday
and ev'rything was in the key of A.
And I lit a cigarette for your brother.
And he turned and heard me say so desp'rately,
"Baby, please, don't take my hope away from me."
You say you want me.
I want another.
You say you pray for me.
Pray for your brother.
Oh, the way that I see him is the way I see myself.
So please stand back now and let time tell you.
Oh, can't you see that time is the key that will unlock the destiny
of we three?
Every night on sep'rate stars, before we go to sleep,
We pray so breathlessly.
Baby, please, don't take my hope away from me.
She is benediction
She is addicted to thee
She is the root connection
She is connecting with he
Here I go and I don't know why
I fell so ceaselessly
Could it be he's taking over me
I'm dancing barefoot
Heading for a spin
Some strange music draws me in
Makes me come on like some heroine
She is sublimation
She is the essence of thee
She is concentrating on he
Chosen by she
Here I go and I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly
Could it be he's taking over me
I'm dancing barefoot
Heading for a spin
Some strange music draws me in
Makes me come on like some heroine
She is re-creation
She, intoxicated by Thee
She has the slow sensation that
He is levitating with she
Here I go and I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly
Till I lose my sense of gravity
I'm dancing barefoot
Heading for a spin
Some strange music draws me in
Makes me come on like some heroine
Oh God, I fell for You
The plot of our life sweats in the dark like a face
The mystery of childbirth, of childhood itself
Grave visitations
What is it that calls to us?
Why must we pray screaming?
Why must not death be redefined?
We shut our eyes, we stretch out our arms
And whirl on a pane of glass
An afixiation, a fix on anything
The line of life, the limb of a tree
The hands of he and the promise that she
Is blessed among women
Oh God, I fell for You
Oh God, I fell for You
Oh God, I fell for You
Baby was a black sheep. Baby was a whore.
Baby got big and baby get bigger.
Baby get something. Baby get more.
Baby, baby, baby was a rock-and-roll nigger.
Oh, look around you, all around you,
riding on a copper wave.
Do you like the world around you?
Are you ready to behave?
Outside of society, they're waitin' for me.
Outside of society, that's where I want to be.
(Lenny!)
Baby was a black sheep. Baby was a whore.
You know she got big. Well, she's gonna get bigger.
Baby got a hand; got a finger on the trigger.
Baby, baby, baby is a rock-and-roll nigger.
Outside of society, that's where I want to be.
Outside of society, they're waitin' for me.
(those who have suffered, understand suffering,
and thereby extend their hand
the storm that brings harm
also makes fertile
blessed is the grass
and herb and the true thorn and light)
I was lost in a valley of pleasure.
I was lost in the infinite sea.
I was lost, and measure for measure,
love spewed from the heart of me.
I was lost, and the cost,
and the cost didn't matter to me.
I was lost, and the cost
was to be outside society.
Jimi Hendrix was a nigger.
Jesus Christ and Grandma, too.
Jackson Pollock was a nigger.
Nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger,
nigger, nigger, nigger.
Outside of society, they're waitin' for me.
Outside of society, if you're looking,
that's where you'll find me.
Outside of society, they're waitin' for me.
Outside of society.
Nodding though, the lamp's lit low, nod for passers underground
To and fro, she's darning and the land is weeping red and pale
Weeping yarn from Algiers, weeping yarn from Algiers
Weaving though, the eyes are pale, what will rend, will also mend
The sifting cloth is binding and the dream she weaves will never end
For we're marching toward Algiers, for we're marching toward Algiers
Lullaby though, baby's gone, lullaby a broken song
Oh, the cradle was our call, when it rocked we carried on
And we marched on toward Algiers, for we're marching for Algiers
We're still marching for Algiers, marching, marching for Algiers
Not to hail a barren sky, sifting cloth is weeping red
The mourning veil is waving high a field of stars and tears we've shed
In the sky a broken flag, children wave and raise their arms
We'll be gone but they'll go on and on and on and on and on
Load up on guns
Bring your friends
It's fun to lose
and to pretend
She's overboard
myself assured
I know, I know a dirty word
Hello, hello, hello, hello,
Hello, hello, hello!
With the lights out
it's less dangerous
Here we are now
Entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now
entertain us
A mulatto
An albino
A mosquito
My libido
Yeah
I'm worse at what
I do best
And for this gift
I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end
Hello, hello, hello, hello,
Hello, hello, hello!
With the lights out
it's less dangerous
Here we are now
Entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now
entertain us
A mulatto
An albino
A mosquito
My libido
Yeah
And I forget
Just what it takes
And yet I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard
Its hard to find
Oh well, whatever, nevermind
Hello, hello, hello, hello,
Hello, hello, hello!
The empty hand of innocence
transfusing street of the sorrows
and children of the wood
Hounded, shredding all veils
and winding all sheets of the dead world droning
Overturning tables laden with silver sacrificial birds
Beating goat-skin drums
Advancing with hands out-stretched
and we keep filling them with mercury nitrate, asbestos
Baby bombs blasting blue
Scavengers picking through the ashes
Children of the mills!
Children of the junkyards!
Sleepy, illiterate, fuzzy little rats
haunted, paint-sniffin',
stoned out of their shaved heads
Forgotten, foraging, mystical children
Foul-mouthed, glassy eyed, hallucinating

Hello, hello, hello, hello,
Hello, hello, hello!
Hello, hello, hello, hello,
Hello!
With the lights out
it's less dangerous
Here we are now
Entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now
entertain us
A mulatto
An albino
A mosquito
My libido
Ah, la la da
Ah, la la da
Ah, la la la
Ah, ma la ta
An albina

My libido,
Oh, My libido
Oh Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Sixty days
Honey, the way you play guitar makes me feel so, makes me feel so masochistic. the way you go down low deep into the neck and I would do anything, and I would do anything and patty hearst, you're standing there in front of the symbionese liberation army flag with your legs spread, I was wondering will you get it every night from a black revolutionary man and his women or whether you really did and now that you're on the run what goes on in your mind, your sisters they sit by the window, you know your mama doesn't sit and cry and your daddy, well you know what your daddy said, patty, you know what your daddy said, patty, he said, he said, he said, "well, sixty days ago she was such a lovely child, now here she is with a gun in her hand."
Hey joe
Hey joe, where're you going with that gun in your hand?
Hey joe, I said where're you goin' with that gun in your hand
I'm gonna go shoot my ol' lady,
You know I found her messing around town with another man
And you know that ain't cool, watch me.
Hey joe, I heard you shot your woman down,
You shot her down to the ground, you shot her.
Yes I did, yes I did, yes I did I shot her, I shot her,
I caught her messin' round with some other man,
So I got on my truck, I gave her the gun and I shot her,
I shot her, shoot her one more time for me.
Hey joe, where you gonna, where you gonna run to,
Where you gonna run to, joe, where you gonna run to?

Go get a cover.
I'm gonna go down south, I'm gonna go down south to mexico,
I'm going down, down, down to mexico where a man can be free
No one's gonna put a noose around my neck,
No one is gonna give me life, no.
I'm goin' down to mexico, I'm going down.
You're not going to hear 'em stand there
And look at the stars as big as holes in the arms
And the stars like a back truck electric flag
And I'm standing there under that flag with your carbine
Between my legs, you know I felt so free of death beyond me
I felt so free, the f.b.i. is looking for me baby,
But they'll never find me, no, they can hold me down like a
And I'm still on the run and they can speculate what I'm fee
But daddy, daddy, you'll never know just what I was feelin',
But I'm sorry I am no little pretty little rich girl,
I am nobody's million dollar baby, I am nobody's patsy anymore
I'm nobody's million dollar baby, I'm nobody's patsy anymore
And I feel so free.
Oh
to be
not anyone
gone
this maze of being
skin
oh
to cry
not any cry
so mournful that
the dove just laughs
the steadfast gasps
oh
to owe
not anyone
nothing
to be
not here
but here
forsaking
equatorial bliss
who walked through
the callow mist
dressed in scraps
who walked
the curve of the world
whose bone scraped
whose flesh unfurled
who grieves not
anyone gone
to greet lame
the inspired sky
amazed to stumble
where gods get lost
beneath
the southern cross
I see it all before me:
the days of love & torment;
the nights of rock-and-roll.
I see it all before me.
Sometimes my spirit is empty;
don't have the'll to go on.
I wish someone would send me
energy.
Give me smth.
Give me smth to give.
Oh, God, give me smth:
a reason to live.
My body is aching.
Don't want sympathy.
C'mon. Come & love me.
C'mon. Set me free.
Set me free.
The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul.
He leadeth me through the path of righteousness for His name's sake.
Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I'll fear no evil, for Thou art with me.
Hey, Lord, I am waitin' for you.
Oh, God, I am waitin' for you;
waitin' to open Your ninety-eight wounds
and be Thee, be Thee.
Lead me, oh, lead me.
Leave me smth.
Leave me smth to live.
Oh, God, give me smth:
a reason to live.
I do not want no handout;
no, not sympathy.
C'mon. Come & love me.
C'mon. Set me free.
Set me free.
C'mon. Set me free
Set me free . . .
Oh, I am so young, so goddamn young.
Oh, I am so young, so goddamn young.
Oh, I am so young, so goddamn.
Set me free.
In the presence of my enemies,
Thou anointest my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.
Surely, goodness & mercy shall follow me
all the days of my life.
And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
Ah, damn, goddamn, goddamn, goddamn.
Here I'm.

Do you not go to the palace of answers with me marie?
Oh no, I don't think so, no
See when they offer me book of gold,
I know soon still that platinum is coming
And when I look inside of your temple
It looks just like the inside of anyone one man,
And when he beckons his finger to me,
Well, I move in another direction,
I move in another dimension
I move in another dimension oh oh oh
I spin, I spiral, and I splatter
Hand of god, I feel the finger,
Hand of god, and I start to whirl
And I whirl, and I whirl,
Don't get dizzy, do not fall now,
Turn, god, God (strange)
Go, go on, go like a dervish,
Turn, god, (strange) make a move
Turn, lord, (strange)
I don't get nervous
Oh I just move in another dimension
Come move in another dimension
Come move in another dimension
Come move in another dimension oh oh oh
Strange strange
Do you go to the temple tonight ?
Oh no, I don't think so, no
We'll go to the pagoda
The palace of answers with me, marie
Oh no, I don't believe so, no
See when they offer me book of gold,
I know soon still that platinum is coming
And when I look inside of your temple
It looks just like the inside of anyone one man
And when he beckons his finger to me,
Well, I move in another dimension
I move in another dimension
I move in another dimension oh oh oh
Pissing in a river, watching it rise
Tattoo fingers shy away from me
Voices voices mesmerize
Voices voices beckoning sea
Come come come come back come back
Come back come back come back
Spoke of a wheel, tip of a spoon
Mouth of a cave, I'm a slave I'm free.
When are you coming? Hope you come soon
Fingers, fingers encircling thee
Come come come come come come
Come come come come come come for me oh
My bowels are empty, excreting your soul
What more can I give you? Baby I don't know
What more can I give you to make this thing grow?
Don't turn your back now, I'm talking to you
Should I pursue a path so twisted?
Should I crawl defeated and gifted?
Should I go the length of a river
[The royal, the throne, the cry me a river]
Everything I've done, I've done for you
Oh I give my life for you.
Every move I made I move to you,
And I came like a magnet for you now.
What about it, you're gonna leave me,
What about it, you don't need me,
What about it, I can't live without you,
What about it, I never doubted you
What about it? What about it?
What about it? What about it?
Should I pursue a path so twisted?
Should I crawl defeated and gifted?
Should I go the length of a river,
[The royal, the throne, the cry me a river]
What about it, what about it, what about it?
Oh, I'm pissing in a river.
Ours is just another skin
That simply slips away
You can rise above it
It will shed easily
It all will come out fine
I've learned it line by line
One common wire
One silver thread
All that you desire
Rolls on ahead
Like a ship in a bottle
Held up to the sun
Sails ain't going nowhere
You can count every one
Until it crashes unto the earth
And simply slips away
You can hide in the open
Or just disappear
Ours is just a craving
And a twist of the wrist
Will undo the stopper
With abrupt tenderness
Die little sparrow
And awake
Singing
It all will come out fine
I've learned it line by line
One common wire
One silver thread
All that you desire
Rolls on ahead
Do you remember me
The ocean rolled
Time was slow
We felt an energy
The cock was crowing
The rum was flowing
A mermaid burns to sea
Beyond the sea
And if i could
Turn where you stood
Would u feel me
Would it be good
Would u remember
So turn the little key
The ocean rolls
Time is slow
Turn the little key
The cock is crowing
The rum is flowing
A mermaid burns to sea
Beyond the sea
I long to see
I long to see
If there's a page for me
Do you remember me
The ocean rolled
Time was slow
We felt an energy
The cock was crowing
The rum was flowing
A mermaid burns to sea
Beyond the sea
I long to see
I long to see
If there a page for me
A page for me
In your diary.
He's delighted to love me, but you know,
I just don't know what to say to him. I just don't know.
Heard it on the radio, it's no good
Heard it on the radio, it's news to me
When she gets something, it's understood
Baby's got somethin' she's not used to
Down, down, poppy, yeah
Down, down, poppy, yeah
Goin' on the corner, I'm gonna score
Baby wants somethin', she's in the mood to
Baby wants somethin', I want more
When I don't get it, I get blue, blue
Down, down, and it's really comin', really comin',
Down, down, poppy, yeah
Goin' on the corner, I'm gonna score
Baby's got somethin', gonna get through, through
When I want somethin' I want more,
Heard it on the radio, there's nothin' I can do do
I'm in the mood to
And I'm a woman and an individual
And I want rockin' real slow
I wanna hear it on the radio
I wanna hear it, I wanna score (poppies)
I wanna hear it on the radio
Baby got it but baby want more
On the radio, heard it on the radio
Baby got it but baby want more
Heard it on the radio
Won't be no need for layin' in the road
Tonight I'm goin' out, oh yeah
Baby got it but baby want more
She won't need it any more Although she was tense and lean in the sun
Splintered like a country
Gently pulled his finger
Everything is soakin' and spread with butter
Their flowers on an average And then they laid her on the table
She connected with the inhaler
And the needle shiftin' like crazy,
She was, she was completely still.
It was like a painting of a vase,
She just lay there and the gas traveled fast
Through the dorsal spine and down and around
(I want more)
The anal cavity, her cranium
(I wanna score)
Just, it was really great, man,
The gas had inflicted her entire spine
With the elements of a voluptuous disease
With a green vapor, made her feet light
Baby want more
Baby was it in the closet.
Baby get it there, baby tag it,
Baby got it and baby begged for it, baby
I don't think (after station) there's any station
(I remember when)
Quite as interesting to me
(baby worship something)
As the 12th station
(laughin' at the flowers)
I tuned in (to the tower) too many centuries
Were calling to me
And I spin, come down thru time
Oh, watch them say you're too high
And I swim through
Hear it on the radio, goddamn in my radio,
Hear it on the radio, hear it on the radio
one long ecstatic pure sensation
restriction started excreting, started excreting, ah exhilarating
bottomless pit
Hey Sheba, hey Salome, hey Venus eclipsin' my way ah.
Her vessel, every woman is a vessel, is evasive, is aquatic.
Everyone, silver ecstatic, platinum disk spinning
The wall is high, the black barn,
The babe in my arms in her swaddling clothes
And I know soon that the sky will split
And the planets will shift,
Balls of jade will drop and existence will stop.
Little sister, the sky is falling, I don't mind, I don't mind.
Little sister, the fates are calling on you.
Ah, here I stand again in this old 'lectric whirlwind,
The sea rushes up my knees like flame
And I feel like just some misplaced Joan Of Arc
And the cause is you lookin' up at me.
Oh baby, I remember when you were born,
It was dawn and the storm settled in my belly
And I rolled in the grass and I spit out the gas
And I lit a match and the void went flash
And the sky split and the planets hit,
Balls of jade dropped and existence stopped, stopped, stop, stop.
Little sister, the sky is falling, I don't mind, I don't mind.
Little sister, the fates are calling on you.
I was goin' crazy, so crazy I knew I could break through with you,
So with one hand I rocked you and with one heart I reached for you.
Ah, I knew your youth was for the takin', fire on a mental plane,
So I ran through the fields as the bats with their baby vein faces
Burst from the barn and flames in a violent violet sky,
And I fell on my knees and pressed you against me.
Your soul was like a network of spittle,
Like glass balls movin' in like cold streams of logic,
And I prayed as the lightning attacked
That something will make it go crack,
Something will make it go crack,
Something will make it go crack,
Something will make it go crack.
The palm trees fall into the sea,
It doesn't matter much to me
As long as you're safe, Kimberly.
And I can gaze deep
Into your starry eyes, baby,
Looking deep in your eyes, baby,
Looking deep in your eyes, baby,
Looking deep in your eyes, baby,
Into your starry eyes, oh.
Oh, in your starry eyes, baby,
Looking deep in your eyes, baby,
Looking deep in your eyes, baby, oh.
Oh, looking deep in your eyes, baby,
Into your starry eyes, baby,
Looking deep in your eyes, baby
The boy was in the hallway drinking a glass of tea
From the other end of the hallway a rhythm was generating
Another boy was sliding up the hallway
He merged perfectly with the hallway,
He merged perfectly, the mirror in the hallway
The boy looked at Johnny, Johnny wanted to run,
but the movie kept moving as planned
The boy took Johnny, he pushed him against the locker,
He drove it in, he drove it home, he drove it deep in Johnny
The boy disappeared, Johnny fell on his knees,
started crashing his head against the locker,
started crashing his head against the locker,
started laughing hysterically
When suddenly Johnny gets the feeling he's being surrounded by
horses, horses, horses, horses
coming in in all directions
white shining silver studs with their nose in flames,
He saw horses, horses, horses, horses,
Horses, horses, horses, horses.
Do you know how to pony like bony maroney
Do you know how to twist, well it goes like this, it goes like this
Baby mash potato, do the alligator, do the alligator
And you twist the twister like your baby sister
I want your baby sister, give me your baby sister,
Dig your baby sister
Rise up on her knees, do the sweet pea, do the sweet pee pee,
Roll down on her back, got to lose control, got to lose control,
Got to lose control and then you take control,
Then you're rolled down on your back and you like it like that,
Like it like that, like it like that, like it like that,
Then you do the watusi, yeah do the watusi
Life is filled with holes, Johnny's laying there, his sperm coffin
Angel looks down at him and says, "Oh, pretty boy,
Can't you show me nothing but surrender?"
Johnny gets up, takes off his leather jacket,
Taped to his chest there's the answer,
You got pen knives and jack knives and
Switchblades preferred, switchblades preferred
Then he cries, then he screams, saying
Life is full of pain, I'm cruisin' through my brain
And I fill my nose with snow and go Rimbaud,
Go Rimbaud, go Rimbaud,
And go Johnny go, and do the watusi, oh do the watusi
There's a little place, a place called space
It's a pretty little place, it's across the tracks,
Across the tracks and the name of the place is you like it like that,
You like it like that, you like it like that, you like it like that,
And the name of the band is the
Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes,
Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes
Baby calm down, better calm down,
In the night, in the eye of the forest
There's a mare black and shining with yellow hair,
I put my fingers through her silken hair and found a stair,
I didn't waste time, I just walked right up and saw that
up there -- there is a sea
up there -- there is a sea
up there -- there is a sea
the sea's the possibility
There is no land but the land
(up there is just a sea of possibilities)
There is no sea but the sea
(up there is a wall of possibilities)
There is no keeper but the key
(up there there are several walls of possibilities)
Except for one who seizes possibilities, one who seizes possibilities.
(up there)
I seize the first possibility, is the sea around me
I was standing there with my legs spread like a sailor
(in a sea of possibilities) I felt his hand on my knee
(on the screen)
And I looked at Johnny and handed him a branch of cold flame
(in the heart of man)
The waves were coming in like Arabian stallions
Gradually lapping into sea horses
He picked up the blade and he pressed it against his smooth throat
(the spoon)
And let it deep in
(the veins)
Dip in to the sea, to the sea of possibilities
It started hardening
Dip in to the sea, to the sea of possibilities
It started hardening in my hand
And I felt the arrows of desire
I put my hand inside his cranium, oh we had such a brainiac-amour
But no more, no more, I gotta move from my mind to the area
(go Rimbaud go Rimbaud go Rimbaud)
And go Johnny go and do the watusi,
Yeah do the watusi, do the watusi ...
Shined open coiled snakes white and shiny twirling and encircling
Our lives are now entwined, we will fall yes we're together twining
Your nerves, your mane of the black shining horse
And my fingers all entwined through the air,
I could feel it, it was the hair going through my fingers,
(I feel it I feel it I feel it I feel it)
The hairs were like wires going through my body
I I that's how I
that's how I
I died
(at that Tower of Babel they knew what they were after)
(they knew what they were after)
[Everything on the current] moved up
I tried to stop it, but it was too warm, too unbelievably smooth,
Like playing in the sea, in the sea of possibility, the possibility
Was a blade, a shiny blade, I hold the key to the sea of possibilities
There's no land but the land
looked at my hands, and there's a red stream
that went streaming through the sands like fingers,
like arteries, like fingers
(how much fits between the eyes of a horse?)
He lay, pressing it against his throat (your eyes)
He opened his throat (your eyes)
His vocal chords started shooting like (of a horse)
Mad pituitary glands
The scream he made (and my heart) was so high (my heart)
Pitched that nobody heard,
No one heard that cry,
No one heard (Johnny) the butterfly flapping in his throat,
(His fingers)
Nobody heard, he was on that bed, it was like a sea of jelly,
And so he seized the first
(his vocal chords shot up)
(possibility)
(like mad pituitary glands)
It was a black tube, he felt himself disintegrate
(there is nothing happening at all)
and go inside the black tube, so when he looked out into the steep
saw this sweet young thing (Fender one)
Humping on the parking meter, leaning on the parking meter
In the sheets
there was a man
dancing around
to the simple
Rock & roll
song
I was down in Georgia
nothing was as real
as the street beneath my feet
descending into air
The cauldron was a-bubbling
the flesh was lean
and the women moved forward
like piranhas in a stream
they spread themselves before me
an offering so sweet
and they beckoned and they beckoned
come on darling eat
Eat the summer cannibals
eat eat eat
you eat the summer cannibals
eat eat eat
They circled around me
natives in a ring
and I saw their souls a-withering
like snakes in chains
and they wrapped themselves around me
ummm what a treat
and they rattled their tales hissin'
come on let's eat
Eat the summer cannibals
eat eat eat
you eat the summer cannibals
eat eat eat
I felt a rising in my throat
the girls a-saying grace
and the air the viscous air
pressed against my face
and it all got too damn much for me
just got too damn rough
and I pushed away my plate
and said boys I've had enough
and I laid upon the table
another piece of meat
and I opened up my veins to them
and said come on eat
Eat the summer cannibals
eat eat eat
you eat the summer cannibals
eat eat eat
you eat the summer cannibals
eat eat eat
you eat the summer cannibals
eat eat eat
Cause I was down in Georgia
nothing was as real
as the street beneath my feet
descending into hell
So eat eat eat
you eat eat eat
you eat eat eat
eat eat eat
Speak to me
Speak to me heart
I feel a needing
to bridge the clouds
Softly go
A way I wish to know
A way I wish to know
Oh you'll ride
Surely dance
In a ring
Backwards and forwards
Those who seek
feel the glow
A glow we will all know
A glow we will all know
On that day
Filled with grace
And the heart's communion
Steps we take
Steps we trace
Into the light of reunion
Paths that cross
will cross again
Paths that cross
will cross again
Speak to me
Speak to me shadow
I spin from the wheel
nothing at all
Save the need
the need to weave
A silk of souls
that whisper whisper
A silk of souls
that whispers to me
Speak to me heart
all things renew
hearts will mend
round the bend
Paths that cross
cross again
Paths that cross
will cross again
Rise up hold the reins
We'll meet again I don't know when
Hold tight bye bye
Paths that cross
will cross again
Paths that cross
Will cross again
Little blue dreamer go to sleep
Let's close our eyes and call the deep
Slumbering land that just begins
When day is done and little dreamers spin
First take my hand then let it go
Little blue boy, you're on your own
Little blue wings as those feet fly
Little blue shoes that walk across the sky
May your path be your own
But I'm with you
And each day you'll grow
He'll be there too
And someday, you go
We'll follow you
As you go, as you go
Little blue star that offers light
Little blue bird that offers flight
Little blue path where those feet fall
Little blue dreamer won't you dream it all
May your path be your own
But I'm with you
And each day you'll grow
He'll be there too
And someday, you go
We'll follow you
As you go, as you go
And in your travels you will see
Warrior wings remember Daddy
And if a mama bird you see
Folding her wings will you remember me
As you go, as you go
As you go, as you go
Easter Sunday, we were walking
Easter Sunday, we were talking
Isabel, my little one, take my hand
Time has come
Isabella, all is glowing
Isabella, all is knowing
And my heart, Isabella
And my head, Isabella
Frederick and Vitalie
Savior dwells inside of thee
Oh, the path leads to the sun
Brother, sister, time has come
Isabella, all is glowing
Isabella, all is knowing
Isabella, we are dying
Isabella, we are rising
I am the spring, the holy ground
The endless seed of mystery
The thorn, the veil, the face of grace
Brazen image, the thief of sleep
The ambassador of dreams, Prince of peace
I am the sword, the wound, the stain
Scorned, transfigured child of Cain
I rend, I end, I return
Again, I am the salt, the bitter laugh
I am the gas in a womb of light, the evening star
The ball of sight that leads that sheds the tears of Christ
Dying and drying as I rise tonight
(Isabella, we are rising)
Isabella, we are rising
Isabella, we are rising
Isabella, we are rising
Isabella, we are rising
Isabella, we are rising
Isabella, we are rising
Isabella, we are rising
Isabella, we are rising
Isabella, we are rising
Isabella, we are
I haven't fucked much with the past,
But I've fucked plenty with the future.
Over the skin of silk are scars
From the splinters of stations
And walls I've caressed.
A stage is like each bolt of wood,
Like a log of Helen, is my pleasure.
I would measure the success of a night
By the way by the way by the amount of piss and seed
I could exude over the columns that nestled the P.A.
Some nights I'd surprise everybody by skipping off
With a skirt of green net sewed over
With flat metallic circles which dazzled and flashed.
The lights were violet and white.
I had an ornamental veil, but I couldn't bear to use it.
When my hair was cropped, I craved covering,
But now my hair itself is a veil,
And the scalp inside is a scalp of
A crazy and sleepy Comanche
Lies beneath this netting of the skin.
I wake up. I am lying peacefully
I am lying peacefully and my knees are open to the sun.
I desire him, and he is absolutely ready to seize me.
In heart I am a Moslem;
In heart I am an American;
In heart I am Moslem,
In heart I'm an American artist,
And I have no guilt.
I seek pleasure.
I seek the nerves under your skin.
The narrow archway; the layers;
The scroll of ancient lettuce.
We worship the flaw, the belly, the belly,
The mole on the belly of an exquisite whore.
He spared the child and spoiled the rod.
I have not sold myself to God.
I'm trampin', trampin'
Try'n-a make heaven my home
I'm trampin trampin
Try'n-a make heaven my home...
I've never been to heaven
But I've been told
Try'n-a make heaven my home
That the streets up there
Are paved with gold
Try'n-a make heaven my home
I'm trampin trampin
Try'n-a make heaven my home
I'm trampin trampin
Try'n-a make heaven my home...
Mother as I write the sun dissolves
Blood life streaming cross my hand
And these words, these words
Hope dashed immortal hope
Hope streaking the canvas sky
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write
We joined the long caravan
Hungry dreaming going west
Just for work just to get a job
And we never got lucky
We just forged on
And the dust the endless dust
Like a plague it covered everything
Hal fell with the fever
And mother I did what I could
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write
We prayed we prayed for rain
I never wanted to see the sun again
All my dresses you made by hand
We left behind on the road
Hal died in my arms
We buried him by the river
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write
Little emerald bird
Wants to fly away
If I cup my hand
Could I make him stay?
Little emerald soul
Little emerald eye
Little emerald soul
Must you say goodbye?
All the things that we pursue
All that we dream
Are composed as nature knew
In a feather green
Little emerald bird
As you light afar
It is true I heard
God is where you are
Little emerald soul
Little emerald eye
Little emerald bird
We must say goodbye
Blood on the T.V., ten o'clock news.
Souls are invaded, heart in a groove.
Beatin' and beatin' so outta time.
What's the mad matter with the church chimes?
Here comes a stranger up on Ninth Avenue.
Leanin' green tower, indiscreet view.
Over the cloud, over the bridge,
sensitive muscle, sensitive ridge of my
space monkey. Sign of the time-time
Space monkey, so outta line-line.
Space monkey, sort of divine.
And he's mine, mine, all mine.
Pierre Clementi, snot full o' cocaine.
The sexual streets, why it's all so insane.
Humans are running, lavender room.
Hoverin' liquid, move over moon for my
space monkey. Sign of the time-time
Space monkey, sort of divine-vine
Space monkey, so out of line and he's mine, mine, oh he's mine
A stranger comes up to him; hands him an old, rusty Polaroid.
It starts crumbling in his hands.
He says, "Oh man, I don't get the picture. This is no picture.
This is just... this just-a... this just-a...
This is my jack-knife. This is my jack-knife.
This is my jack-knife. This is my jack." [shriek]
Rude excavation, landin' site.
Boy hesitatin', jack-knife.
He rips his leg open, so out of time.
Blood and light runnin'. It's all like a dream.
Light of my life, he's dressed in flame.
It's all so predestined. It's all such a game for my
space monkey. Sign of the time-time.
Space monkey, sort of divine-vine.
Space monkey, so out of line and it's all just space, just space.
There he is, up in a tree.
Oh, I hear him callin' down to me.
That banana-shaped object ain't no banana.
It's a bright, yellow U.F.O.
And he's coming to get me. Here I go.
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up ...
Oh, goodbye mama. I'll never do dishes again.
Here I go from my body.
Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Help!
So you want to be a rock & roll star
Well listen now to what i say
Get yourself an electric guitar
And take some time and learn how to play
And when hair's combed right
And your pants are tight
It's gonna be all right
With time you go downtown
To the agent man he won't let you down
Sell your soul to the company
They're all waiting there
To sell plastic wares
And in a week or two if you make the charts
The girls will tear you apart
What you pay for these riches and fame
Well it's all a vicious game
You're a little insane
What you get is the public acclaim
Don't forget who you are
You're a rock & roll star
Na na na na na . . .
Hey you. come here. get up.
Ah, this is the era where everybody creates.
Recognize my face?
They call me broken glass.
That's because of the sound [ ]
[ ]
What you pay for all these riches and fame
Well it's all a vicious game
You're a little insane.
Well you're a little insane
Oh a little insane
'cause the thing that you gain
Is the public acclaim
Don't forget who you are
Don't forget who you are
Don't forget who you are
You're a rock & roll star
Sixteen and time to pay off
I got this job in a piss factory inspecting pipe
Forty hours thirty-six dollars a week
But it's a paycheck, Jack.
It's so hot in here, hot like Sahara
You could faint in the heat
But these bitches are just too lame to understand
Too goddamned grateful to get this job
To know they're getting screwed up the ass
All these women they got no teeth or gum or cranium
And the way they suck hot sausage
But me well I wasn't sayin' too much neither
I was moral school girl hard-working asshole
I figured I was speedo motorcycle
I had to earn my dough, had to earn my dough
But no you gotta, you gotta [relate, babe,]
You gotta find the rhythm within
Floor boss slides up to me and he says
"Hey sister, you just movin' too fast,
You screwin' up the quota,
You doin' your piece work too fast,
Now you get off your mustang sally
You ain't goin' nowhere, you ain't goin' nowhere."
I lay back. I get my nerve up. I take a swig of Romilar
And walk up to hot shit Dot Hook and I say
"Hey, hey sister it don't matter
Whether I do labor fast or slow,
There's always more labor after."
She's real Catholic, see.
She fingers her cross and she says
"There's one reason. There's one reason.
You do it my way or I push your face in.
We knee you in the john
If you don't get off your get off your mustang Sally,
If you don't shake it up baby.
" Shake it up, baby. Twist & shout"
Oh that I could will a radio here.
James Brown singing
"I Lost Someone" or the Jesters and the Paragons
And Georgie Woods
The guy with the goods and Guided Missiles ...
But no, I got nothin', no diversion, no window,
Nothing here but a porthole in the plaster, in the plaster,
Where I look down,
Look at sweet Theresa's convent
All those nurses, all those nuns scattin' 'round
With their bloom hoods like cats in mourning.
Oh to me they, you know,
To me they look pretty damn free down there
Down there not having crystal smooth
Not having to smooth those hands against hot steel
Not having to worry about the inspeed
The dogma the inspeed of labor
They look pretty damn free down there,
And the way they smell, the way they smell
And here I gotta be up here smellin'
Dot Hook's midwife sweat
I would rather smell the way boys smell--
Oh those schoolboys the way their legs
Flap under the desks in study hall
That odor rising roses and ammonia
And way their dicks droop like lilacs
Or the way they smell that forbidden acrid smell
But no I got, I got pink clammy lady in my nostril
Her against the wheel me against the wheel
Oh slow motion inspection is drivin' me insane
In steel next to Dot Hook -- oh we may look the same--
Shoulder to shoulder sweatin' 110 degrees
But I will never faint, I will never faint
They laugh and they expect me to faint
But I will never faint
I refuse to lose, I refuse to fall down
Because you see it's the monotony that's got to me
Every afternoon like the last one
Every afternoon like a rerun next to Dot Hook
And yeah we look the same
Both pumpin' steel, both sweatin'
But you know she got nothin' to hide
And I got something to hide here called desire
I got something to hide here called desire
And I will get out of here--
You know the fiery potion is just about to come
In my nose is the taste of sugar
And I got nothin' to hide here save desire
And I'm gonna go, I'm gonna get out of here
I'm gonna get out of here, I'm gonna get on that train,
I'm gonna go on that train and go to New York City
I'm gonna be somebody,
I'm gonna get on that train, go to New York City,
I'm gonna be so bad I'm gonna be a big star
And I will never return,
Never return, no, never return,
To burn out in this piss factory
And I will travel light.
Oh, watch me now.
In my Blakean year
I was so disposed
Toward a mission yet unclear
Advancing pole by pole
Fortune breathed into my ear
Mouthed a simple ode
One road is paved in gold
One road is just a road
In my Blakean year
Such a woeful schism
The pain of our existence
Was not as I envisioned
Boots that trudged from track to track
Worn down to the sole
One road is paved in gold
One road is just a road
Boots that tramped from track to track
Worn down to the sole
One road was paved in gold
One road was just a road
In my Blakean year
Temptation but a hiss
Just a shallow spear
Robed in cowardice
Brace yourself for bitter flack
For a life sublime
A labyrinth of riches
Never shall unwind
The threads that bind the pilgrim's sack
Are stitched into the Blakean back
So throw off your stupid cloak
Embrace all that you fear
For joy shall conquer all despair
In my Blakean year
So throw off your stupid cloak
Embrace all that you fear
For joy shall conquer all despair
In my Blakean year
Moooooove! Ask the angels who they're calling,
Go ask the angels if they're calling to thee
Ask the angels while they're falling
Who that person could possibly be
And I know you got the feeling,
You know, I feel it crawl across the floor
And I know it got you reelin'
And honey honey the call is for war
And it's wild wild wild wild.
Everybody got the feelin'
You know the feeling and it's stronger each day
Everybody wants to be reelin'
And baby baby I'll show you the way
And I know it's hard sometimes,
You got a piece and hit across the sky
And I know it's hard sometimes
And world war is the battle cry
And it's wild wild wild wild
Across the country through the fields
You know I see it written 'cross the sky
People rising from the highway
And war war is the battle cry
And it's wild wild wild wild.
Armageddon, it's gotten
No savior jailer can take it from me
World ending, it's just beginning
And rock and roll is what I'm born to be
And it's wild wild wild wild
Wild wild wild wild X3
Ask the angels if they're startin' to move
Comin' in droves in from L.A.
Ask the angels if they're starting to groove
Lightning as armor and it's today
It's wild wild wild wild
Wild wild wild wild X3
You are the adrenaline rushing through my veins
Stimulate my heart, heavy crystalline
You are the sulphur extinguished by the flame
You are everything to me, all this in your name
Oh, walking in your blue coat, weeping admiral
All the twisted cellars they had to hand your name
Ended all that's static in a myth of sin
Mirror minor static pale adrenaline
Take it
Ah, take it that day you said to me
"It could never be", say the hour of sea to seep
Have you said Godspeed?
Love is a vampire, energy of dead
Love is like a boomerang, comin' back again
On a rack of red leather, on a rack of skin and sin
Tell me how to pale in adrenaline
And you said to me, "It could never be"
Say the hour of sea to seep
And you said to me
Have you said Godspeed?
I could make it all
All the twisted sand and foam
I'll never, ever return
I could make it, make it all
I'm walking, follow me down the twisted stair
Stuck inside a memory shot and shot again
Hand upon a railin', courtin' fate and fate
We're sailin', sailin', sailin' sailin'
Down a black, black river and I plunge right in
And I plunge right in, in adrenaline, in adrenaline
I move inside my vein
Ah, you're the speed I need
Throw the pistol in
Oh, your love's a vampire
Comin' in to suck
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Oh, I fell and fell and fell
Down, down, down, down
Oh, I'm gonna duck
If you believe all your hope is gone
down the drain of your humankind
the time has arrived
you'll be waiting here as I was
in a snow-white shroud
waiting underground
there by the ridge be a gathering beneath the pilgrim moon
where we shall await the beat of your feet hammering the earth
where the great ones tremble
in their snow-white shrouds
waiting underground
if you seek the kingdom come, come along
waiting by the ridge there'll be a gathering
beneath the pilgrim moon
where the [railroad] thunders
oh where we shall await the beat of your feet hammering the earth
and as the earth resounds where the great ones tremble
and your humankind becomes as one
and then we will arise
in our snow-white shrouds
when we'll be as one
but until that day we will just await
in our snow-white shrouds
waiting underground
in our snow-white shrouds
waiting underground
Waiting underground
Waiting underground
Waiting underground
Waiting underground
Waiting underground
Waiting underground
Late afternoon, dreaming hotel
We just had the quarrel that sent you away.
I was looking for you, are you gone gone?
Called you on the phone, another dimension.
Well, you never returned, oh you know what I mean.
I went looking for you, are you gone, gone?
Down by the ocean it was so dismal,
Women all standing with a shock on their faces.
Sad description, oh I was looking for you.
Everyone was singing, girl is washed up
On Redondo Beach and everyone is so sad.
I was looking for you, are you gone gone?
Pretty little girl, everyone cried.
She was the victim of sweet suicide.
I went looking for you, are you gone gone?
Down by the ocean it was so dismal,
Women all standing with shock on their faces.
Sad description, oh I was looking for you.
Desk clerk told me girl was washed up,
Was small, an angel with apple blonde hair, now.
I went looking for you, are you gone gone?
Picked up my key, didn't reply.
Went to my room, started to cry.
You were small, an angel, are you gone gone?
Down by the ocean it was so dismal.
I was just standing with shock on my face.
The hearse pulled away, and the girl that had died, it was you.
You'll never return into my arms 'cause you were gone gone.
Never return into my arms 'cause you were gone gone.
Gone gone, gone gone, good-bye.
Every night before I go to sleep
Find a ticket, win a lottery,
Scoop the pearls up from the sea
Cash them in and buy you all the things you need.
Every night before I rest my head
See those dollar bills go swirling 'round my bed.
I know they're stolen, but I don't feel bad.
I take that money, buy you things you never had.
Oh, baby, it would mean so much to me,
Oh, baby, to buy you all the things you need for free.
I'll buy you a jet plane, baby,
Get you on a higher plane to a jet stream
And take you through the stratosphere
And check out the planets there and then take you down
Deep where it's hot, hot in Arabia, babia,
Then cool, cold fields of snow
And we'll roll, dream, roll, dream, roll, roll, dream, dream.
When we dream it, when we dream it, when we dream it,
We'll dream it, dream it for free, free money,
Free money, free money, free money,
Free money, free money, free money.
Every night before I go to sleep
Find a ticket, win a lottery.
Every night before I rest my head
See those dollar bills go swirling 'round my bed.
Oh, baby, it would mean so much to me,
Baby, I know our troubles will be gone.
Oh, I know our troubles will be gone, goin' gone
If we dream, dream, dream for free.
And when we dream it, when we dream it, when we dream it,
Let's dream it, we'll dream it for free, free money,
Free money, free money, free money,
Free money, free money, free money,
Free money, free money, free money,
Free money, free money, free money,
Free money, free money, free money,
Free money, free money, free money,
Free money, free money, free money,
Free money, free money, free money, free
A fire of unknown origin took my baby away.
Fire of unknown origin took my baby away.
Swept her up and off my wavelength.
Swallowed her up like the ocean in a fire thick and gray.
Death comes sweeping thru the hallway like a ladies' dress.
Death comes riding down the hallway in it's sunday best.
Death comes driving; death comes creeping;
death comes I can't do nothing.
Death goes, there must be something that remains.
Death, it made me sick and crazy
'cause that fire took my baby away.
I just don't know what to do tonight,
My head is aching as I drink and breathe
Memory falls like cream in my bones, moving on my own.
There must be something I can dream tonight,
The air is filled with the moves of you,
All the fire is frozen yet still I have the will, ooh, ah.
Trumpets, violins, I hear them in the distance
And my skin emits a ray, but I think it's sad, it's much too bad
That our friends can't be with us today.
wild leaves are falling
falling to the ground
every leaf a moment
a light upon the crown
that we'll all be wearing
in a time unbound
and wild leaves are falling
falling to the ground
every word that's spoken
every word decreed
every spell that's broken
every golden deed
all the parts we're playing
binding as the reed
and wild leaves are falling
wild wild leaves
as the campfire's burning
as the fire ignites
all the moments turning
in the stormy bright
well enough the churning
when enough believe
the coming and the going
wild wild leaves
wild wild leaves
wild wild leaves
His father died and left him a little farm in New England.
All the long black funeral cars left the scene
And the boy was just standing there alone
Looking at the shiny red tractor
Him and his daddy used to sit inside
And circle the blue fields and grease the night.
It was if someone had spread butter on all the fine points of the stars
'Cause when he looked up they started to slip.
Then he put his head in the crux of his arm
And he started to drift, drift to the belly of a ship,
Let the ship slide open, and he went inside of it
And saw his daddy 'hind the control board streamin' beads of light,
He saw his daddy 'hind the control board,
And he was very different tonight
'Cause he was not human, he was not human.
And then the little boy's face lit up with such naked joy
That the sun burned around his lids and his eyes were like two suns,
White lids, white opals, seeing everything just a little bit too clearly
And he looked around and there was no black ship in sight,
No black funeral cars, nothing except for him the raven
And fell on his knees and looked up and cried out,
"No, daddy, don't leave me here alone,
Take me up, daddy, to the belly of your ship,
Let the ship slide open and I'll go inside of it
Where you're not human, you are not human."
But nobody heard the boy's cry of alarm.
Nobody there 'cept for the birds around the New England farm
And they gathered in all directions, like roses they scattered
And they were like compass grass coming together
Into the head of a shaman bouquet
Slit in his nose and all the others went shooting
And he saw the lights of traffic beckoning like the hands of Blake
Grabbing at his cheeks, taking out his neck,
All his limbs, everything was twisted and he said,
"I won't give up, won't give up, don't let me give up,
I won't give up, come here, let me go up fast,
Take me up quick, take me up, up to the belly of a ship
And the ship slides open and I go inside of it where I am not human."
I am helium raven and this movie is mine,
So he cried out as he stretched the sky,
Pushing it all out like latex cartoon, am I all alone in this generation?
We'll just be dreaming of animation night and day
And won't let up, won't let up and I see them coming in,
Oh, I couldn't hear them before, but I hear 'em now,
It's a radar scope in all silver and all platinum lights
Moving in like black ships, they were moving in, streams of them,
And he put up his hands and he said, It's me, it's me,
I'll give you my eyes, take me up, oh now please take me up,
I'm helium raven waitin' for you, please take me up,
Don't let me here, the son, the sign, the cross,
Like the shape of a tortured woman,
The true shape of a tortured woman,
The mother standing in the doorway letting her sons
No longer presidents but prophets
They're all dreaming they're gonna bear the prophet,
He's gonna run through the fields dreaming in animation
It's all gonna split his skull
It's gonna come out like a black bouquet shining
Like a fist that's gonna shoot them up
Like light, like Mohammed Boxer
Take them up up up up up up
Oh, let's go up, up, take me up, I'll go up,
I'm going up, I'm going up
Take me up, I'm going up, I'll go up there
Go up go up go up go up up up up up up up
Up, up to the belly of a ship.
Let the ship slide open and we'll go inside of it
Where we are not human, we're not human.
Well, there was sand, there were tiles,
The sun had melted the sand and it coagulated
Like a river of glass
When it hardened he looked at the surface
He saw his face
And where there were eyes were just two white opals,
Two white opals,
Where there were eyes there were just two white opals
And he looked up and the rays shot
And he saw raven comin' in
And he crawled on his back and he went up
Up up up up up up
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way,
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way,
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way,
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way,
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way,
We like birdland.
Oh the story's told been told retold
From the sacred scriptures to the tabloids
All the fuss and fight none above a whisper
The soul of gold the belly of a boy
Well they drew him from the forest
Like they draw blood
Tied him to a tree like St. Sebastian
And he turned his head and let the arrows fly
Through the trees, the trees
The ornamental leaves
Boy cried wolf
Wolf don't come
Wolf within
Boy cried wolf
In the ancient mold they're dancing down
Calling to the moon but it don't answer
And they fell on their knees
and passed the bowl around
And the blood the blood the sacramental blood
Boy cried wolf
Wolf don't come
Wolf within
Boy cried wolf
I am the body I am the stream
I am the wake of everything
They bring me flowers that are myself
Garlands of blood that are myself
Slain the lamb that is himself
Torn reborn the cries of our dismay
Are nothing to the wind but whose to mind
Kings are lifted up and kings are thrown
Lost received retrieved
The human tide
Innocence had its day
Innocence had its day
Innocence innocence

Oh I see you stare spi-pi-pi-pi-pi-pi (spiraling) up there and ho,
Oh, into the center of my brain, and baby come, baby go
And free the hurricane, oh, I go into the center of the airplane
Baby gotta move to the center of my pain
And my heart starts pumping, my fists start pumping
Upset, total abandon, you know I love you so
Total abandon, ooh, walla walla walla,
Oh I see you stare spi-pi-pi-pi-pi-pi (spiraling) up there and ho,
Oh, into the center of my brain and baby come, baby go
And free the hurricane, oh I go into the center of the airplane,
Baby gotta box in the center of the ring
And my heart starts pumping, my fists start pumping
Upset, total abandon, you know I love you so.
Total abandon, ooh wah
Oh I go into the center of the airplane,
Baby gotta go to the center of my brain
And my heart starts pumping, my fists start pumping,
Got no recollection of my past reflection,
So I'm free to move in the resurrection.
My heart starts pumping, my fists start pumping,
My heart pumping, my heart pumping, my heart pumping
Coming in the airport, coming in the sea,
Coming in the garden, got a conscious stream,
Coming in a washroom, coming on a plane,
Coming in a force field, coming in my brain
And my heart, my heart,
Total abandon, total abandon, total abandon,
Total abandon, total abandon, total abandon,
Total abandon
Oh I go into the center of the airplane,
Baby gotta move to the center of my brain,
My heart Oh
Darlin' come under cover
Another night to discover
Let's slip where senses gather
Let's drift between the sea and sky
As the night goes by
Sands shift
Orchids so strange
In the moonlight
Brushing our faces
Places where love blooms
And dies
While the night goes by
Oh, and the spirits call
Sun upon your shadows fall
Tracing every breath we draw
Come into my dreams
Come into my dreams
Darlin' let's go where the night goes
Let's drift where senses gather
Let's make this night last forever
Into my dreams
Into my dreams
Darlin' let's go
Where the night goes
Time slips
Oh darlin' how it flies
When the night goes by
All through the night
Sirens call
Come to me
I'll come to you
As the night softly
goes by bye
Midnight
Moon on our shoulder
Daybreak
Another one older
Darlin' heavenly blue
Glories fade into view
Let's go
Under the stars
That are beating
Under the moonlight
Stars shoot
Dusk just a whisper
Make this night
Last forever
Oh how I wonder
Where the night goes
Oh Let's wonder
Where the night goes
As the night goes
By bye
By Bye
So, you want to be a rock 'n roll star
Well, listen now to what I say
Get yourself an electric guitar
And take some time and learn how to play
And when your hair's combed right
And your pants are tight, it's gonna be all right
With time you go downtown
To the agent man, he won't let you down
Sell your soul to the company
They're all waiting there to sell plastic wares
And in a week or two, if you make the charts
The girls will tear you apart
What you pay for these riches and fame?
Well, it's all a vicious game, you're a little insane
What you get is the public acclaim
Don't forget who you are, you're a rock 'n roll star
Na, na na, na na na, na na
Na na, na na, na na na
Hey you, come here, get up
Ah, this is the era where everybody creates
Recognize my face? They call me broken glass
That's because of the sounds What you pay for all these riches and fame?
Well, it's all a vicious game, you're a little insane
Well, you're a little insane, oh a little insane
'Cause the thing that you gain is the public acclaim
Don't forget who you are, don't forget who you are
Don't forget who you are, you're a rock 'n roll star
I see it all before me:
the days of love and torment;
the nights of rock-and-roll.
I see it all before me.
Sometimes my spirit's empty;
don't have the will to go on.
I wish someone would send me
energy.
Give me something.
Give me something to give.
Oh, God, give me something:
a reason to live.
My body is aching.
Don't want sympathy.
Come on. Come and love me.
Come on. Set me free.
Set me free.
The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul.
He leadeth me through the path of righteousness for His name's sake.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me.
Hey, Lord, I'm waitin' for you.
Oh, God, I'm waitin' for you;
waitin' to open Your ninety-eight wounds
and be Thee, be Thee.
Lead me, oh, lead me.
Leave me something.
Leave me something to live.
Oh, God, give me something:
a reason to live.
I don't want no handout;
no, not sympathy.
Come on. Come and love me.
Come on. Set me free.
Set me free.
Come on. Set me free
Set me free . . .
Oh, I'm so young, so goddamn young.
Oh, I'm so young, so goddamn young.
Oh, I'm so young, so goddamn.
Set me free.
In the presence of my enemies,
Thou anointest my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.
Surely, goodness and mercy shall follow me
all the days of my life.
And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
Ah, damn, goddamn, goddamn, goddamn.
Here I am.
The boy was in the hallway drinking a glass of tea
From the other end of the hallway a rhythm was generating
Another boy was sliding up the hallway
He merged perfectly with the hallway,
He merged perfectly, the mirror in the hallway
The boy looked at Johnny, Johnny wanted to run,
but the movie kept moving as planned
The boy took Johnny, he pushed him against the locker,
He drove it in, he drove it home, he drove it deep in Johnny
The boy disappeared, Johnny fell on his knees,
started crashing his head against the locker,
started crashing his head against the locker,
started laughing hysterically
When suddenly Johnny gets the feeling he's being surrounded by
horses, horses, horses, horses
coming in in all directions
white shining silver studs with their nose in flames,
He saw horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses.
Do you know how to pony like bony maroney
Do you know how to twist, well it goes like this, it goes like this
Baby mash potato, do the alligator, do the alligator
And you twist the twister like your baby sister
I want your baby sister, give me your baby sister, dig your baby sister
Rise up on her knees, do the sweet pea, do the sweet pee pee,
Roll down on her back, got to lose control, got to lose control,
Got to lose control and then you take control,
Then you're rolled down on your back and you like it like that,
Like it like that, like it like that, like it like that,
Then you do the watusi, yeah do the watusi
Life is filled with holes, Johnny's laying there, his sperm coffin
Angel looks down at him and says, "Oh, pretty boy,
Can't you show me nothing but surrender ?"
Johnny gets up, takes off his leather jacket,
Taped to his chest there's the answer,
You got pen knives and jack knives and
Switchblades preferred, switchblades preferred
Then he cries, then he screams, saying
Life is full of pain, I'm cruisin' through my brain
And I fill my nose with snow and go Rimbaud,
Go Rimbaud, go Rimbaud,
And go Johnny go, and do the watusi, oh do the watusi
There's a little place, a place called space
It's a pretty little place, it's across the tracks,
Across the tracks and the name of the place is you like it like that,
You like it like that, you like it like that, you like it like that,
And the name of the band is the
Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes,
Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes
Baby calm down, better calm down,
In the night, in the eye of the forest
There's a mare black and shining with yellow hair,
I put my fingers through her silken hair and found a stair,
I didn't waste time, I just walked right up and saw that
up there -- there is a sea
up there -- there is a sea
up there -- there is a sea
the sea's the possibility
There is no land but the land
(up there is just a sea of possibilities)
There is no sea but the sea
(up there is a wall of possibilities)
There is no keeper but the key
(up there there are several walls of possibilities)
Except for one who seizes possibilities, one who seizes possibilities.
(up there)
I seize the first possibility, is the sea around me
I was standing there with my legs spread like a sailor
(in a sea of possibilities) I felt his hand on my knee
(on the screen)
And I looked at Johnny and handed him a branch of cold flame
(in the heart of man)
The waves were coming in like Arabian stallions
Gradually lapping into sea horses
He picked up the blade and he pressed it against his smooth throat
(the spoon)
And let it deep in
(the veins)
Dip in to the sea, to the sea of possibilities
It started hardening
Dip in to the sea, to the sea of possibilities
It started hardening in my hand
And I felt the arrows of desire
I put my hand inside his cranium, oh we had such a brainiac-amour
But no more, no more, I gotta move from my mind to the area
(Go Rimbaud go Rimbaud go Rimbaud)
And go Johnny go and do the watusi,
Yeah do the watusi, do the watusi ...
Shined open coiled snakes white and shiny twirling and encircling
Our lives are now entwined, we will fall yes we're together twining
Your nerves, your mane of the black shining horse
And my fingers all entwined through the air,
I could feel it, it was the hair going through my fingers,
(I feel it I feel it I feel it I feel it)
The hairs were like wires going through my body
I I that's how I
that's how I
I died
(At that Tower of Babel they knew what they were after)
(they knew what they were after)
[Everything on the current] moved up
I tried to stop it, but it was too warm, too unbelievably smooth,
Like playing in the sea, in the sea of possibility, the possibility
Was a blade, a shiny blade, I hold the key to the sea of possibilities
There's no land but the land
looked at my hands, and there's a red stream
that went streaming through the sands like fingers,
like arteries, like fingers
(how much fits between the eyes of a horse?)
He lay, pressing it against his throat (your eyes)
He opened his throat (your eyes)
His vocal chords started shooting like (of a horse) mad pituitary glands
The scream he made (and my heart) was so high (my heart) pitched that nobody heard,
No one heard that cry,
No one heard (Johnny) the butterfly flapping in his throat,
(His fingers)
Nobody heard, he was on that bed, it was like a sea of jelly,
And so he seized the first
(his vocal chords shot up)
(possibility)
(like mad pituitary glands)
It was a black tube, he felt himself disintegrate
(there is nothing happening at all)
and go inside the black tube, so when he looked out into the steep
saw this sweet young thing (Fender one)
Humping on the parking meter, leaning on the parking meter
In the sheets
there was a man
dancing around
to the simple
Rock & roll
song 
hello friend I've come a-calling
passively stationed
active patrol
sliding in at high noon like some reluctant sheriff
not want to get involved in it all
who stands guard for each other
why must we guard anything at all
anything at all
from the earth's four corners the people are calling
forming equations but the questions are hard
all men are brothers killing each other
and mother earth is wringing in wonder
who stands guard for each other
why must we guard anything at all
anything at all
whirl away now
whirl away now
whirl away now
whirl away
there's a cross on the road
there's a great mill turning
some seeking answers
some born to dancers
you can hold on the blade and turn around forever

some giveth their hand

the staff of life all around you

some material thing

like wishes in the wind
for the sake of their coat
or the colors of their coat
or the color of their skin
or the name on their shoes
and the mother cries "Why they taken my son?"
and the father wonders "Are they taking my boy?"
he extended his hand
he gave them his land
he gave them his bread
he gave them his heart

There will be no famine in my existence
I merge with the people of the hills
Oh people of Ethiopia
Your opiate is the air that you breathe
All those mint bushes around you
Are the perfect thing for your system
Aww clean clean it out
You must rid yourself from these, these animal fixations
You must release yourself
From the thickening blackmail of elephantiasis
You must divide the wheat from the rats
You must turn around [and look oh God]
When I see Brancusi
His eyes searching out the infinite abstract spaces
In the [radio] rude hands of sculptor

Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Come on darling
Can you picture this?
Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you
How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry
Touch if you will my belly
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you
Even doves have pride
How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold
Maybe I'm just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry
Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you
How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold? (a world that's so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding (maybe, maybe I'm like my father)
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold (ya know he's 2 bold)
Maybe I'm just like my mother (maybe you're just like my mother)
She's never satisfied (she's never, never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other (why do we scream at each other)
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry
When doves cry (doves cry, doves cry, doves cry
Don't cry
Darling don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't don't cry
In the straw-colored light
In light rapidly changing
On a life rapidly fading
Have you seen death singing
Have you seen death singing
With a throat smooth as a lamb
Yet dry as a branch not snapping
He throws back his head
And he does not sing a thing mournful
Have you seen death singing
Have you seen death singing
Have you seen death singing
In the straw-colored light
He sings a black embrade
And white opals swimming
In a child's leather purse
Have you seen death swimming
Have you seen death swimming
With a throat smooth as a lamb
Yet dry as a branch not snapping
He throws back his head
And he does not sing a thing mournful
Have you seen death singing
Have you seen death singing
Have you seen death singing
In the straw-colored light
He sings of youth enraged
And the burning of Atlanta
And these viral times
And May ribbons streaming
And straw-colored curls a-turning
A mother's vain delight
And woe to the sun
And woe to the young
Another hearse is drawn
Have you seen death singing
In the straw-colored light
On a field of red one gold star
Raised above his head
Raised above his head
He was not like any other
He was just like any other
And the song they bled
Was a hymn to him
Awake my little one
The seed of revolution
Sewn in the sleeve
Of cloth humbly worn
Where others are adorned
Above the northern plain
The great birds fly
With great wings
Over the paddy fields
And the people kneel
And the men they toil
Yet not for their own
And the children are hungry
And the wheel groans
There before a grass hut
A young boy stood
His mother lay dead
His sisters cried for bread
And within his young heart
The seed of revolution sewn
In cloth humbly worn
While others are adorned
And he grew into a man
Not like any other
Just like any other
One small man
A beard the color of rice
A face the color of tea
Who shared the misery
Of other men in chains
With shackles on his feet
Escaped the guillotine
Who fought against
Colonialism imperialism
Who remained awake
While others slept
Who penned like Jefferson
Let independence ring
And the cart of justice turns
Slow and bitterly
And the people were crying
Plant that seed that seed
And they crawled on their bellies
Beneath the giant beast
And filled the carts with bodies
Where once had been their crops
And the great birds swarm
Spread their wings overhead
And his mother dead
And the typhoons and the rain
The jungles in flames
And the orange sun
None could be more beautiful
Than Vietnam
Nothing was more beautiful
Than Vietnam
And his heart stopped beating
And the wheel kept turning
And the words he bled
Were a hymn to them
I have served the whole people
I have served my whole country
And as I leave this world
May you suffer union
And my great affection
Limitless as sky
Filled with golden stars
The question is raised
Raised above his head
Was he of his word
Was he a good man
For his image fills the southern heart
With none but bitterness
And the people keep crying
And the men keep dying
And it's so beautiful
So beautiful
Give me one more turn
Give me one more turn
One more turn of the wheel
One more revolution
One more turn of the wheel
This dead city longs to be
This dead city longs to be free
Seven screaming horses
Melt down in the sun
Building scenes on empty dreams
And smoking them one by one
This dead city longs to be
This dead city longs to be living
Is it any wonder there's squalor in the sun
With their broken schemes and their lotteries
They never get nowhere
Is it any wonder they're spitting at the sun
God's parasites in abandoned sites
and they never have much fun
If I was a blind man
Would you see for me
Or would you confuse
The nature of my blues
And refuse a hand to me
Is it any wonder crying in the sun
Is it any wonder I'm crying in the sun
Well I built my dreams on your empty scenes
Now I'm burning them one by one
This damn city this dead city
Immortal city
Motor city
Suc-cess city
Longs to be
Longs to be
Free
Free
Free
When, when will you be landing?
When, when will you return?
Feel, feel my heart expanding
You and your alien arms
All my earthly dreams are shattered,
I'm so tired I quit
Take me forever, it doesn't matter
Deep inside of your ship.
La, la la la la la landing.
Please, oh oh won't you return?
Feel, see your blue lights are flashing,
You and your alien arms
Deep in the forest I whirl like I did as a little girl
Let my eyes rise in the sky looking for you
Oh you know, I would go anywhere at all
'Cause no star is too far with you, with you
La, la la la la la landing.
Please, oh oh won't you return?
Feel, feel my heart expanding,
You and your alien arms
All my earthly dreams are shattered,
I'm so tired I quit
Take me forever, it doesn't matter
Deep inside of your ship
Land, land
Oh I am waiting for you,
Oh I am waiting for you, oh I am waiting for you,
Waiting for you to take me up by my starry spine
Ohhhh ohhhh with your distant fingers
Oh I'm waiting for you, waiting for you,
Oh I am waiting for you
(Smith/Daugherty)
Life is designed With unfinished lines
That another sings Each story unfolds
Like it was gold Upon a ragged wing
The bold and the fair Suffer their share
He whispered to his kin All of my debts
Left with regrets I'm sorry for everything
Trespasses stretch like broken fences Winding as they may
Trespasses stretch like broken fences Hope to mend them one day
And she pinned back her hair Shouldered with care
The burdens that were his Mending the coat
That hung on the post In heart remembering
Trespasses stretch like broken fences Winding as they may
Trespasses stretch like broken fences Hope to mend them one day
And her time was to come Called to her son
This your song to sing All of our debts
Wove with regrets Upon a golden string
And he found the old coat Hung on a post
Like a ragged wing And took as his own
The sewn and unsown Joyfully whistling
I had a dream Mr. King If you'll beg my pardon
I was trespassing A sacred garden
And the blossoms fell And they dropped like candy
And nature cried Gandhi Gandhi
And nature cried Gandhi Gandhi
When he was a boy He was afraid of the dark
His mother would fast And pray at his feet
And the lamp burned as he slept Slept as he dreamed
He was dreaming of his sisters Dressed in white muslin
Dressed in white muslin Dancing in a ring
He was afraid of the dark And the lamp burned
And his mother fasted And prayed as he slept
Dreaming of blossoms They were burning his throat
He had eaten flowers Fell burning
Flowers fell burning From the young girls' hair
He was whispering Into his god's ear
Let the children be so Let the children be so
And the lamplight flickered flickered And his mother withered like Job
And he lay there dreaming And the blossoms fell
And Tilak's trumpet Proceeded to call
And the blossoms fell And they dropped like candy
And the people cried Gandhi Gandhi...
I had a dream Mr. King If you'll beg my pardon
I was trespassing The sacred garden
And the blossoms fell Well, they dropped like candy
And nature cried Gandhi Gandhi
Hey little man Awake from your slumber
Get 'em with the numbers Get 'em with the numbers
He was frail and shy And the cast of his mind
Was mercurial Was mercurial
As the sacred verbs Scrawled
In the dust On the floor
On the floor Long live revolution
And the spinning wheel And a handful of salt
And a handful of salt The untouchables
Dropped like candy They called to him
Gandhi Gandhi The children of god
With hands full of candy They called to him
Gandhi Gandhi Feel our woes
Man of the giving Rejoin the living
Rejoin the living Awake from the net
Where you've been sleeping And their climbing climbing
The flowing hair And the golden flowers
Of the young girls Well they dropped all around
They dropped like candy And people cried
Gandhi Gandhi Awake little man
Awake from your slumber And get 'em with the numbers
Get 'em with the numbers
One Two Three Four hundred
Thousand million people
People People...
Awake from your slumber Awake from your slumber
Awake from your slumber And get 'em with the numbers
Get 'em with the numbers Long live revolution
And the spinning wheel Awake awake
Is the mighty appeal Oh, people awake
Awake from your slumber And get 'em with the numbers
Get 'em with the numbers
I had a dream Mr. King
If you'll beg my pardon I was trespassing
The sacred garden And the blossoms fell
Dropped like candy And nature called
Gandhi Gandhi Gandhi Gandhi
Awake from your slumber Awake from your slumber
And get 'em with the numbers Get 'em with the numbers

I'm with you always
You're ever on my mind
In a light to last a whole life through
Each way I turn
the sense of you surrounds
in every step I take
In all I do
Your thoughts your schemes
captivate my dreams
Everlasting, ever new
Sea returns to sea
And sky to sky
In a life of dream am I
When I'm with you
Deep in my heart
How the presence of you shines
In a light to last a whole life through
I recall the wonder of it all
Each dream of life I'll share with you
Sea returns to sea
And sky to sky
In a life of dream am I
When I'm with you
I'm with you always
You're ever on my mind
In a light to last a whole life through
The hand above
turns those leaves of love
All and all a timeless view
Each dream of life
Flung from paradise
Everlasting, ever new
Dream of Life

Listen to my story. Got two tales to tell.
One of fallen glory. One of vanity.
The world's roof was raging, but we were looking fine;
'Cause we built that thing and it grew wings,
in Nineteen-Fifty-Nine.
Wisdom was a teapot; Pouring from above.
Desolation angels
Served it up with Love.
Ignitin'[g strife] like every form of light,
then moved by bold design,
slid in that thing and it grew wings,
in Nineteen-Fifty-Nine.
It was Blood, shining in the Sun;
First: Freedom!
Speeding the american claim:
Freedom; Freedom; Freedom; Freedom!
China was the tempest; [And] Madness overflowed.
[The] Lama was a young man,
and [he] watched his world in flames.
Taking Glory down by the edge of clouds;
It was a cryin'[g] shame.
Another lost horizon. Tibet the fallen star.
Wisdom and compassion Crushed, in the land of Shangri-La.
But in the land of the Impala, honey, well,
we were lookin' Fine,
'cause we built that thing and it grew wings;
In Nineteen-Fifty-Nine.
'Cause we built that thing and it grew wings;
In Nineteen-Fifty-Nine.
It was the best of times, it's [was] the worst of times;
In 1959; 1959; 1959; 1959; 1959; 1959; 1959.
It was the best of times; It was the worst of times.
[In] Nineteen-Fifty-Nine.
In the medieval night
'Twas love's design
And the sky was open
like a Valentine
All the lacy lights
Where wishes fall
And like Shakespeare's child
I wished on them all
Ahh to be your destiny
was all that I pursued
I could see the sights
from the lofty heights
But my heart obscured the view
I was looking for you
Looking for you
What could I do
I was looking for you
Along the black river
The ambassador jewels
And you were reflected
in all that I saw
In the towers of gold
In the wheel and wing
Gripping my senses
like an ancient claim
Many is the time I knelt in the light
appealing to all that I know
Guide my eyes and steps
that I may find love true
I was looking for you
Looking for you
What could I do
I was looking for you
Come on darlin'
All that hearts desire
was written before us
In the medieval fire
It was love's design
In the glittering stars
Like Shakespeare's child
To be where you are
From the Portobello Road
To the Port of Marseilles
Where the dervish turns
Where the wild goats play
Looking for you
I was
Lower the thing the skin of a cat
Skin it to the left just laying there
No other thing is luck like that
And you set it said it said nothing
Went to the party very discouraged
I watched the litter pile like a wall
I looked at the river just couldn't forgive it
It was ladened with all kinds of shit
Still I admit that I didn't say nothing
I turned my back walked away
Got to face the fact that I didn't say nothing
Everyone was dancing I stood over in the corner
I was listening they were saying this and saying that
And putting this one down but nothing was delivered
Nothing good was coming I just stood there
I couldn't believe it but I didn't say nothing
I walked the floor then I looked away
Got to face the fact that I didn't say nothing
How long how long will we make do
Maybe it's time to break on through
Gonna lift my skirts gonna straighten up
Gonna get well I'm gonna do something
Gonna face the fact gonna give it back
And I'm gonna do something won't hold my tongue
Won't hold the thought won't hold the card
Well I'm gonna do something
Oh my brain I got to complain
You can refrain but I'm gonna do something
How long how long will we make do
Maybe it's time to break on through
Out in the desert I saw that old cat skinned
I saw it floating in the river
I saw and no one seemed to mind
They sat there they sat there watching the sun
I saw it float away and I watched the buildings crumble
Like dust in the hand and we watched the sun
Spread its wings and fly away
And in the mountains a cry echoes
Don't say nothing
Don't say nothing no
Don't say nothing no
I walk it up
I walk it down
I know not what I do
Your love is a sword
Made of folded gold
In the shape of my heart
I walk it up
Walkin' blind
Walkin' blind
All I heard was him
All I saw were eyes
By the world begun
I walk it down
Walkin' blind
Walkin' blind
Angel falling, angel blessed
Sister how fair is your love
I know not what I do
Walkin' blind
Walkin' blind
From the face of love to love
From the face of love to love
I was a wing in heaven blue
soared over the ocean
soared over Spain
and I was free
needed nobody
it was beautiful
it was beautiful
I was a pawn
didn't have a move
didn't have nowhere
that I could go
but I was free
I needed nobody
it was beautiful
it was beautiful
and if there's one thing
could do for you
you'd be a wing
in heaven blue
I was a vision
in another eye
and they saw nothing
no future at all
yet I was free
I needed nobody
it was beautiful
it was beautiful
and if there's one thing
could do for you
you'd be a wing
in heaven blue
and if there's one thing
could do for you
you'd be a wing
in heaven blue
and if there's one thing
could do for you
you'd be a wing
in heaven blue
Mother Rose every little morn' tend to me
There she stood, waiting by the door selflessly
Took my hand took it with a smile tenderly
Mother rose every little morn' tend to me
Now's the time to turn the view
Now that I have you
And I'll rise every little morn' tend to thee
When you rise open up your eyes you will see
There I'll be waiting by the door come to me
Take my hand look into your heart there I'll be
Now's the time to turn the view
Now that I have you
Now's the time to turn the view
Now that I have you
Roses growing up by my door, climbing up the vine
All the thorns and pain obscured, roses shall divine
Where we feel no pain and the love inside
Where roses climb, roses shall divine
Roses shall divine, I feel the pain when the roses die
Roses shall divine holy mother
Mother of gold, mother with stories
Told and retold, she felt our tears
Heard our sighs and turned to gold
Before our eyes
She rose into the light
She rose into the light
She rose into the light
...
People try to put us d-down (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
Just because we get around (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
Things they do look awful c-c-cold (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
I hope I die before I get old (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
refrain:
This is my generation
This is my generation, baby
Why don't you all f-fade away (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
And don't try to dig what we all s-s-say (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
I'm not trying to cause a big s-s-sensation (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
I'm just talkin' 'bout my g-g-g-generation (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
refrain
Why don't you all f-fade away (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
And don't try to d-dig what we all s-s-say (Talkin' 'bout my generation)

People try to put us d-down (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
Just because we g-g-get around (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
Things they do look awful c-c-cold (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
Yeah, I hope I die before I get old (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
refrain
Here we go around again
Curve of life spiraling
Everything we've ever known
As the seed of life gets blown
And the miracle of time
When will that time just end
Remember, you decide
Take that vow
Grab that ring It's not a whim
Not a whim
When you be cashing in
Try to turn your life around
And all the things you do resound
And then you can't loose control
Say your time has come and then
Hard to pinpoint find the seam
Where that one time ends
Where that time begins
Remember, you decide
Take that vow
Take a stand
Grab that ring
It's not a whim
It's not a whim
It's only time
That you're cashing in
In the white noise of desire
We can't hear a single thing
Floating round the fragile bough
Afflictions of the human soul
Its beauty immaterial
You decide
Stand along
The fallen ones
Take revenge
Defeated sons
Rend that coat
From seam to seam
It's only time
It's only time
That you spend
You spend
It's only time
You spend
Its only time
You spend
It's only life
That you're cashing in
Oh I see you stare spi-pi-pi-pi-pi-pi (spiraling) up there and ho,
Oh, into the center of my brain, and baby come, baby go
And free the hurricane, oh, I go into the center of the airplane
Baby gotta move to the center of my pain
And my heart starts pumping, my fists start pumping
Upset, total abandon, you know I love you so
Total abandon, ooh, walla walla walla,
Oh I see you stare spi-pi-pi-pi-pi-pi (spiraling) up there and ho,
Oh, into the center of my brain and baby come, baby go
And free the hurricane, oh I go into the center of the airplane,
Baby gotta box in the center of the ring
And my heart starts pumping, my fists start pumping
Upset, total abandon, you know I love you so.
Total abandon, ooh wah
Oh I go into the center of the airplane,
Baby gotta go to the center of my brain
And my heart starts pumping, my fists start pumping,
Got no recollection of my past reflection,
So I'm free to move in the resurrection.
My heart starts pumping, my fists start pumping,
My heart pumping, my heart pumping, my heart pumping
Coming in the airport, coming in the sea,
Coming in the garden, got a conscious stream,
Coming in a washroom, coming on a plane,
Coming in a force field, coming in my brain
And my heart, my heart,
Total abandon, total abandon, total abandon,
Total abandon, total abandon, total abandon,
Total abandon
Oh I go into the center of the airplane,
Baby gotta move to the center of my brain,
My heart Oh
I took a walk out to the sun
But I just, just couldn't take it
I followed a dream
It was circular
But I just, just could not fake it
Step to the left the left the left
Step to the right the right the right
Pick up the sign the sign the sign
For a stride of the mind the mind
Simon of the desert blew into town
On the scalding tail of a bright cold wind
Slipped through the sand
Footprints emerged
Where no one was walking
Simon had been
Dropped from heaven
To a ready made world
Said I'm no Sufi
But I'll give it a whirl
We booked passage
On the Book of the Dead
Time to travel Simon said
Step to the left the left the left
Step to the right the right the right
Pick up the sign the sign the sign
On the stride of the mind the mind the mind
Come on move where dreams increase
Where every man is a masterpiece
If you want to be counted
As another kind
And you're true, pursue
Stride of the mind the mind the mind...
He bowed three times
Removed his fez
Pointed to heaven
And Simon says
The mind the mind the mind
Pick up the sign the mind the mind
It's a vertical climb the climb the climb
Stride of the mind the mind the mind
Pick up the sign the sign the sign
It's a vertical climb the climb
Take it in stride
Come my one, look at the world Bird beast butterfly
Girls sing notes of heaven Birds lift them up to the sky
Spring is departing Spring is departing
Her thoughts are darting like a rabbit Like a rabbit 'cross the moon
Shines of light over your hair As boys croon
Pretty in pink It makes me wonder
What could ever bring you down I see tears falling
From those eyes of brown
Hearing a voice, you turn your head You vanish into the mist
Of your thoughts And I
Want to grasp What brings you down
Open up those eyes of brown
The world is changing Your heart is growing
Hearing a voice you turn your head Girls turn by ones, by twos
Notes pour bad and tender Eradicate your blues
The good world The good world
Come my one, look around you Bird, beast, butterfly
Girls sing notes from heaven Birds lift them up to the sky
I see brown eyes That see girls turning
Girls turning Cartwheels
The good world The good whirl
The good world The good whirl
Come my one, look at your world Don't let it bring you down
Come on open for me Those eyes of brown
I see girls turning Cartwheels
Cartwheels Cartwheels...
I was alone and content in my world
Dancing on air
You sent to me a message that said
I like your style
Will you come to the temple tonight
And dance for me there
I pledge to you all that you wish
The moon and the stars
Lo and beholden
Why don't you give it up
Lo and beholden Come on you know it's true
Lo and beholden
Oh I'm beholden to you
In the palace there was wild reverie
And the look in your eyes
As I dropped veil after veil
Was drunken desire
The dove calls and God notes it all
The naked truth
Here is my veil the seventh and last
It will cost you
Lo and beholden
Why don't you give it up
Lo and beholden
Come on you know it's true
Lo and beholden
Oh I'm beholden to you
The royal word has passed
The prophet's head is all I ask
For beauty and the naked truth
It will cost you
Lo and beholden
Why don't you give it up
Lo and beholden
Come on you know it's true
Lo and beholden
Oh I'm beholden to you

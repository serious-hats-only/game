Did you get the picture yet
I'm painting you a portrait of young... If you're having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one
I got the rap patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that want to make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's "Money Cash Hoes"
I'm from the hood, stupid What type of facts are those
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was having dough
I'm like "Fuck critics" you can kiss my whole asshole
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads, fuckers

Year's '94 and my trunk is raw
In my rear view mirror is the motherfucking law
I got two choices y'all, pull over the car or, hmm,
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
Now I ain't trying to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars I could fight the case
So I, pull over to the side of the road
I heard "Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?"
Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low
Or do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some mo?
"Well you was doing fifty-five in the fifty-four", uh huh
"License and registration and step out of the car
"Are you carrying a weapon on you, I know a lot of you are"
I ain't stepping out of shit, all my papers legit
"Well do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?"
Well my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk and the back
And I know my rights so you goin' need a warrant for that
"Aren't you sharp as a tack? You some type of lawyer or something?
"Somebody important or something?"
Child, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
"Well we'll see how smart you are when the K-9 come"
I got ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one, hit me
Ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one, hit me
Ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one, hit me
Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong arm a hoe
This is not a hoe in the sense of having a pussy
But a pussy having no goddamn sense try and push me
I tried to ignore 'em, talk to the Lord
Pray for 'em, cause some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
The only thing that's goin' happen is I'ma get to clapping and
He and his boys goin' be yapping to the captain
And there I go trapped in the Kit Kat again
Back through the system with the riff raff again
Fiends on the floor scratching again
Paparazzi's with they cameras, snapping them
D.A. tried to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mil for bail cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassing them
Trying to play the boy like he's saccharine
But ain't nothing sweet 'bout how I hold my gun
I got ninety nine problems being a bitch ain't one, hit me
Ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one, hit me
Ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got ninety nine problems but a bitch ain't one, hit me
Having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got ninety nine problems and a bitch ain't one
You're crazy for this one, Rick, it's your boy 
Uhh, uh uh uh

Cause I don't fuckin need em
Take em out the hood, keep em lookin good
But I don't fuckin feed em
First time they fuss I'm breezin
Talkin bout, "What's the reasons?"
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word, bitch
Better trust than believe em
In the cut where I keep em
til I need a nut, til I need to beat the guts
Then it's, beep beep and I'm pickin em up
Let em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga fist in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks

And I watch you eat it
I still don't know why
Why I love you so much
Ohhh

In spite to put me to shame
Have my laundry in the streets
Dirty or clean
Give it up for fame
But I still don't know why
Why our love is so much
Yeah And Baby
It's amazing I'm in this Maze with you
I just cant crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you here, one day you there, one day you care
You're so unfair
Sipping from the cup
Till it runneth over, Holy Grail Blue told me remind you niggas
Fuck that shit y'all talk about
I'm the nigga, uh caught up in all these lights and cameras, uh
But look what that shit did to Hammer, uh
God damnit it I like it
The bright lights is enticing
But look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night
30 mill for one fight
But soon as all the money blows, all the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheating on me
What I do, I took her back, fool me twice
That's my bad, I cant even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder, Momma please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame
Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself And we all just entertainers
And were stupid, and contagious
And we all just entertainers And Baby
Its amazing Im in this maze with you
I just cant crack your code
One day you're screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you here, one day you there, one day you care
You're so unfair sipping from the cup
Till it runneth over, Holy Grail Now I got tattoos on my body
Psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper
Photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See them by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough
I'm calling this off
Who the fuck I'm kidding though?
Im getting high
Sitting low
Sliding by
In that big body
Curtains all in my window
This fame hurts
But this chain works
I think back
You asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga deal with
It, this shit aint work
This light work
Camera snapping, my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and IRS
Get the hell up off of your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for
Dry yours
Why you mad
Take the good with the bad
Dont throw that baby out with the bath water
Youre still alive
Still that nigga
Nigga you survived
You still getting bigger nigga
Living the life
Vanilla wafers
In a villa
Illest nigga alive
Michael Jackson thriller And Baby
Its amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just cant crack your code
One day you 're screaming you love me loud
The next day youre so cold
One day you here, one day you there, one day you care
You're so unfair sipping from the cups
Till it runneth over, Holy Grail You get the air out my lungs
Whenever you need it,
And you'd take the blade right out my heart So you can watch me bleed
And I still don't know why...
(Don't know why)
Why I love it so much...
Yeah...
And you play this game
In spite to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve forever in ink
With guess who's name
But I still don't know why
(Don't know why)
Why I love it so much
Yeah... And Baby
It's amazing Im in this maze with you
I just cant crack your code
One day you're screaming you love me loud
The next day youre so cold
One day you here, one day you there, one day you care
Youre so unfair
Sipping from the cup
Till it runneth over, Holy Grail Most incredible baby
Uhh - mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Yeah, yeah. uhh I can't see 'em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry Good dudes - I know you love me like cooked food
Even though a nigga got move like a crook move
We was together on the block since we lunch
We shoulda been together havin 4 Seasons brunch
We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather
So now we travel first class to change the forecast
Never in bunches, just me and you
I loved your point of view cause you held no punches
Still I left you for months on end
It's been months since I checked back in
Well somewhere in a small town, somewhere lockin a mall down
Woodgrain, four and change, Armor All'd down
I can understand why you want a divorce now
Though I can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it
Pretend to be heroic, that's just one to grow with
But deep inside a nigga so sick I can't see 'em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry On repeat, the CD of Big's "Me and My Bitch"
Watchin Bonnie and Clyde, pretendin to be that shit
Empty gun in your hand sayin, "Let me see that clip"
Shoppin sprees, pull out your Visa quick
A nigga had very bad credit, you helped me lease that whip
You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6
We was so happy poor but when we got rich
That's when our signals got crossed, and we got flipped
Rather mine, I don't know what made me leave that shit
Made me speed that quick, let me see - that's it
It was the cheese helped them bitches get amnesia quick
I used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin they love me
Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me
Then I showed up in that dubbed out buggy
And then they got fuzzy and they don't remember that
And I don't remember you. I can't see 'em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry 
A face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone
Word back home is that you had a special friend
So what was oh so special then?
You have given away without gettin at me
That's your fault, how many times you forgiven me?
How was I to know that you was plain sick of me?
I know the way a nigga livin was whack
But you don't get a nigga back like that!
Shit I'm a man with pride, you don't do shit like that
You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that
You don't throw away what we had, just like that
I was just f***in them girls, I was gon' get right back
They say you CAN turn a bad girl good
But once a good girl's goin bad, she's gone forever.
i mourn forever
Shit I gotta live with the fact I did you wrong forever I can't see 'em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry I f***ed up girl. The most amazing feeling I feel,
Words can't describe what I'm feeling for real
Baby, I paint the sky blue,
My greatest creation was you
You, you, glory False alarms and false starts
All made better by the sound of your heart
All the pain of the last time
I prayed so hard it was the last time
Your mama said you danced for her
Did you wiggle your hands for her?
Glory, Glory, Glory Sorry, Everything that I prayed for
God's gift I wish I woulda prayed more
God makes no mistakes, I made a few
Rough sled in here and there but I made it through
I wreak havoc on the world
Get ready for part two
A younger, smarter, faster me
So a pinch of Hov, a whole glass of B Glory, yeah The most amazing feeling I feel,
Words can't describe what I'm feeling for real
Baby, I paint the sky blue,
My greatest creation was you Your grand pop died of liquor failure
Then he died of liver failure
Deep down he was a good man
God damn I can't deliver failure
Bad ass little Hov,
Two years old shopping on Saville Row
Wicked ass little Bey, hard not to spoil you rotten, looking like little me
The most beautiful-est thing in this world,
Is Daddy's little girl.
You don't yet know what swag is But you was made in Paris and mama woke up the next day and shot her album package
Last time the miscarriage was so tragic,
We was afraid you disappeared but nah baby, you magic
So there you have it, sh-t happens
Just make sure the plane you on is bigger than your carry-on baggage
Everybody goes through stuff
Life is a gift, love
Open it up
You're a child of destiny
You're the child of my destiny
You're my child with the child from destiny's child
That's a hell of recipe
Glory, glory, glory sorry Glory, uh, yeah The most amazing feeling I feel,
Words can't describe what I'm feeling for real

Geyeah Dear Summer, I know you gon' miss me
For we been together like Nike Airs and crisp tees
S dots with polo fleeces
Purple label shit with the logo secret Gimme couple years, shit, I might just sneak in
A couple words and like peaches and herb
We'll be reunited and it feels so hood
Have the whole world saying, "How you still so good?" Well, I do, this in my slumber summer
I ain't none of these half-assed newcomers
You know how I do Summer, I drop heat when you bring the sun up
The combo make niggaz act up, I pick the gun up Niggaz back up, they know I'm not no fronter
I don't talk shit, I just flip it, ya
Sorry Lance, I'm just trying to advance my quotes
I ain't making you the butt of my jokes But let's not stray from what I came to say
To my beloved, think we need sometime away
They say if you love it, you should let it out its cage
And fuck it, if it comes back you know it's there to stay It's tugging at my heart but this time apart is needed
From the public, who should've gave me the Pulitz'
Instead gave me they ass to kiss
But you know me, thugging 'til the casket dips But still shine light down on all my peers
I know they weird some queer, I still want them to share
And all the success I received, I know you can't believe
I still love 'em but they don't love me They like the drunk uncle in your family
You know they lame, you feel ashamed
But you love 'em the same
It's like when niggaz make subliminal records If it ain't directed directly at me, I don't respect it
You don't really want it with Hov for the record
I put a couple careers on hold, you could be next kid
Keep entering the danger zone You gon' make that boy Hov put your name in a song
If you that hungry for fame, motherfucker, c'mon
Say when take ten paces and spin
But on another note, 'bout to take another vaca' On another boat, goddamn a motherfucker rode
His way out the hood and I pray that I stay out for good
But any day you know a nigga could try and play
Like he Suge then I gotta play like Dutch Schultz You pass the dutchie, I blast you, trust me
Niggaz can't fuck with me
I'm in a good mood, you lucky, I got a good groove
And I ain't trying to fuck my thing up But I will lay down a couple green bucks, get you cleaned up
Now, I'm 'Pulp Fiction', Colt four-fifth and
Young niggaz that [unverified], no religion Listen here, Summer baby, I just believe it's the right thing to do
I got a brand new bitch, corporate America
She showing me a lot of action right now And I know you put me on my feet and all
But I mean, it's time for me to grow
You gotta let me go, baby, you gotta let me go I'm done for now so one for now
Possibly forever, we had fun together
But like all good things, we must come to an end
Please show the same love to my friends, dear Summer Who wants that perfect love story anyway, anyway?
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
Who wants that hero love that saves the day, anyway?
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
What about the bad guy goes good, yeah?
And the missing love that's misunderstood, yeah?
Black hour glass, our glass
Toast to clichés in a dark past
Toast to clichés in a dark past Boy meets girl, girl perfect woman
Girl get the bustin' before the cops come running
Chucking deuces, chugging D'USSE
Fuck what you say, boys in blue say I don't care if we on the run
Baby as long I'm next to you
And if loving you is a crime
Tell me why do I bring out
The best in you I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell, but they don't know
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, noooo
I know it's crazy but They can take me
Now that I found the places that you take me
Without you I got nothing to lose I'm an outlaw, got an outlaw chick
Bumping 2Pac, on my outlaw shit
Matching tatts, this Ink don't come off
Even if rings come off
If things ring off
My nails get dirty
My past ain't pretty, my lady is, my Mercedes is
My baby momma harder than a lot of you niggas
Keep it 100, hit the lottery niggas
You ain't about that life ain't gotta lie to me, nigga
You know it's 'til the death, I hope it obvi to niggas
Cross the line, speak about mine
I'mma wave this TEC, I'm a geek about mine
Touch a nigga where his rib at, I click clat
Push your ma'fucka wig back, I did that
I been wilding since a juvi
She was a good girl till she knew me
Now she is in the drop bussin' U'e
Screaming... They can take me
Now that I found the places that you take me
Without you I got nothing to lose Deeper then words, beyond right
Die for your love, beyond life
Sweet as a Jesus piece, beyond ice
Blind me baby with your neon lights
Ray Bans on, police in sight
Oh, what a beautiful death
Let's both wear white
If you go to heaven and they bring me to hell
Just sneak out and meet me, bring a box of L's
She fell in love with the bad guy, the bad guy
What you doing with them rap guys, them rap guys
They ain't see potential in me girl, but you see it
If it's me and you against the world, then so be it I don't care if they give me life
I get all of my life from you
And if loving you had a price
I would pay my life for you I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell, but they don't know
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, noooo
I know it's crazy but I don't care I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
I don't care I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
(Without you I got nothing to lose) Ah
Potrei cantare mille volte ancora ma Forse sarebbe tutto inutile.
Sognavo i palchi tra i banchi di scuola (ah)
Forse non sono più idee stupide.
Chiedo aiuto al cielo quando sono solo
Prego, io non ho più la voglia
Voglio una vita diversa da questa
A quanto pare fare il salto ti porta a cadere giù
Prima guardami bambina lo vedi che
Sono alle strette baby
Guardo 'sti grattacieli ti vedo tra le stelle
Io qui da solo tra i marciapiedi
E non ho soldi veri per venire fino lì da te che
Mi aspetti sola da tempo ancora per quel caffè e.
Meno male che c'è ancora qualcuno che crede in me
Vorrei parlarti dei miei guai fanno paura a me
Dirti di quello che non sai parlarne un po' con te Non siamo più io e te Io sono solo e...
E' ora che facciamo i seri dai Qua passa il tempo e tu non passi mai
Moriamo insieme come Bonny e Clyde Prendimi la mano scappiamo con tutti contro che
Ogni cosa che faccio poi la fai anche te
Ogni giorno mi sveglio e mi rendo conto che
Che io vinca o che perda lo faccio insieme a te
Come Bonny e Clyde
Come Bonny e Clyde
Come Bonny e Clyde
Come Bonny e.
Io e te, come Bonny e Clyde
Come sempre mai
Come skinny e Nike Air baby
Oggi sei qui, domani boh, dopodomani preghi che ritorni
La distanza è come una pioggia di vetri Questa sera suono devo distruggere il club
Tu che sai chi sono pure al di fuori del rap
L'amore non si può comprare con la golden card Vieni qui fai piano, capisci ci sono i miei di là
La musica che ci lega, tu che mi stai dietro prega
Che se poi cadiamo speriamo che nessuno ci veda
Andiamo anche se so che è tardi Ma che ne sanno gli altri
Di tutto quello che ho passato senza lamentarmi
Senza mai distrarmi, puntando sempre più in alto
Vola nero, vola in cielo, vola
Buttati ch'è il tuo momento, che il nostro momento
Io e te, Bonny e Clyde
E' ora che facciamo i seri dai
Qua passa il tempo e tu non passi mai Moriamo insieme come Bonny e Clyde
Prendimi la mano scappiamo con tutti contro che
Ogni cosa che faccio poi la fai anche te
Ogni giorno mi sveglio e mi rendo conto che
Che io vinca o che perda lo faccio insieme a te
Come Bonny e Clyde
Come Bonny e Clyde
Come Bonny e Clyde

I'm focused man,
Tell Stout to holla at me man
Young Hove ya heard (new Mya!) Yes, yollin Jigga man be ballin'
Biv chicks pigeons Hove
Some of them be grawlin'
Get the best of you
Whenever I put my all in
Have mamis callin' for the law, darling
Jigga and Paulin ass drop
Coops with half the tops
Suppose half my not
Nigga mad when I brag 'bout the cash I got
But I'm used to not having alot
I'm from the gutta and (ah)
I ain't the type that ever chase your box
I'm a type to interior decorate the watch
I'm a type to sling heavy weight on the block
And every state like Pac words Jiggers to hurt (holla) (Mya:)
Ya lips are telling me yes
While you're kissing on my neck
Making me feel so...
Should I stay, should I go
I don't know
Your hot boy style, drives me wild
But in the back of my mind I know Even thought I
I wont see
How you put that thing on me
I can't let you best of me
(x2)
(Best of me, best of me) Conversation ain't what?
Big thighs got you stuck
Feelings starting to show
Should I stay, should I go
I don't know
You're driving me crazy
I wanna be your lady But I got a man at home Even thought I
I wont see
How you put that thing on me
I can't let you best of me
(x2)
(Let you get the best of me, the best of me, the best of me) (Jay-z:)
5-4-3-2-1
Carolina blue kits
Hottes nigga on the block
Used to willie bicycle since I was six
High school cross-over wave to wave pics
Music is the same shit
Gave away hits
So 'ma get it together
Forget it forever when I
Go at you hard, I can
Get it through leather, you
Act like Jigga, can't
Get at whoever
Talking you got a man
Okay 'ma (and...)
That's high school, making me chase you for months
Having affair, actin like an adult for once
Pluss my hand is up your skirt
God damn you flirt
What's a little me on top gon' hurt
Maybe a little but...
Pain is pleasure and pressure bust pipes
And you look like the "I like it rough" type
We can crush the night tell me what you like
I got a yellow bottle on a bucket of ice (shit right?, Young Hova) (Mya:)
Even thought I
I wont see
How you put that thing on me
I can't let you best of me
(x2) Check the bassline out, uh huh
Jigga, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, yeah
Let it bump though It's the hard knock life, for us
It's the hard knock life, for us
Steada treated, we get tricked
Steada kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life From standin' on the corners boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars, New York has ever seen
For droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggaz know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggaz with the rubber grips, bust shots?
And if you with me, mom, I rub on your tits, and what not I'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it fifty-fifty
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy
And sip the cris' and get pissy pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga biggie, baby
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter
Nigga Volume 2, y'all niggaz get ready It's the hard knock life, for us
It's the hard knock life, for us
Steada treated, we get tricked
Steada kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life! I flow for those 'dro'ed out all my niggaz
Locked down in the ten by fo', controllin' the house
We live in hard knocks, we don't take over we borrow blocks
Burn 'em down and you can have it back, daddy, I'd rather that
I flow for chicks wishin', they ain't have to strip to pay tuition
I see you vision mama, I put my money on the longshots
All my ballers that's born to clock
Now I'ma be on top whether I perform or not I went from lukewarm to hot, sleepin' on futons and cots
To king size dream machines, the green fives
I've seen pies let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
Then I put it down type braille
I'm tight grill with the phony, rappers y'all might feel we homies
I'm like still, y'all don't know me, shit
I'm tight grill when my situation ain't improvin'
I'm tryin' to murder everything movin', feel me It's the hard knock life, for us
It's the hard knock life, for us
Steada treated, we get tricked
Steada kisses, we get kicked It's the hard knock life, for us
It's the hard knock life, for us
Steada treated, we get tricked
Steada kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life I don't know how to sleep, I gotta eat, stay on my toes
Gotta a lot of beef, so logically, I prey on my foes
Hustling's still inside of me, and as far as progress
You'd be hard-pressed, to find another rapper hot as me
I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out
Didn't really appreciate it, till the second one came out
So I stretched the game out, x'ed your name out
Put jigga on top, drop albums non-stop for ya, nigga It's the hard knock life, for us
It's the hard knock life, for us
Steada treated, we get tricked
Steada kisses, we get kicked It's the hard knock life, for us
It's the hard knock life, for us
Steada treated, we get tricked
Steada kisses, we get kicked It's the hard knock life
It's the hard knock life
It's the hard knock life Hello Brooklyn! Hello Brooklyn

Mornin' she rush for my touch, this is about lust
Cold sweats occur when I'm not with her My presence is a must, must, must
Bonita Applebum, I gotta put you on
If I didn't when we cuttin', the feelin' would be too strong
In any form, I'm givin' you sweet dreams That Sugar Hill, she call me her sweet thing
That Black Rain that take away your pain
Just for one night, baby, take me in vein Now that feelin' got you trippin', you no wanna feel no different

Shopping's like coppin', you constantly need it
I'm never around, you constantly seekin'
You'll never be down, I know where your peak is 9 1/2 weeks is better than 12-steps
I keep tryin' to remind you to keep tellin' yourself
Now your conscience is interfering like better yourself
Like you better get help but when that medicine's felt? We're back together, don't ever leave me
Don't ever let 'em tell you that you'll never need me
My China White, 'til we D.O.A.

When the world got too much and you pleaded with me
Who helped you immediately? How speedy of me
How could you deny me so vehemently? Now your body is shakin', tryin' to free it of me
And your soul is in control, tryin' to lead it from me
And your heart no longer pledge allegiance to me

Whoo, Whoo
Now can I get an encore, do you want more Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
uh uh uh uh Now what the hell are you waitin forrrr!!! After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, make some noise
get 'em jay
Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah hearin me rap is like hearin G. Rap in his prime
I'm, young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the -- you expect? Yep, yep
Grand openin, grand closin
God your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him with no pen Just draw off inspiration
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him
with cheap imitations for THESE GENERATIONS! Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar Now what the hell are you waitin for! After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, make some noise
What the hell are you waitin forrrr!!!
Look what you made me do
look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you
When you first come in the game
they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits
look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
to be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan, wearin the 4-5
It ain't to play games witchu
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin you to smithereens Cocksucker take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold out concerts
So muh-- if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore
Tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure, of walking in your shoes
Caught in the undertoe, just caught in the undertoe
Every step that I take is another mistake to you Caught in the undertoe, just caught in the undertoe
And every second I waste is more than
I can take!
I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do Is be more like me and be less like you
I've, become so numb!
(Can I get a encore?)
(Do you want more, more, more, more)
I've, become so nuuuummmmbb!
(So for one last time I need y'all to roar!)
(One last time I need y'all to roar!) [Jay-Z] Uh-huh
[$hort] That's right
[Jay-Z] Uh-huh-uh, it was all good just a week ago
[$hort] Last week I had everything
[Jay-Z] Uh, uh-huh-uh, had this all good just a week ago
[$hort] I had the money... had the cars, the bitches
[Jay-Z] Uh-huh, yeah, it was all good just a week ago
[$hort] and the jewelry... and then my muthafuckin' niggas started snitchin'
[Jay-Z] Uh-huh, uh uh, yo
[$hort] Bitch! Verse 1: Jay-Z
Growin up in the hood just my dog and me
We used to hustle in the hood for, all to see
Problems, I called on him, he called on me
We wasn't quite partners, I hit him off my P
Met him unlocked doors, off my keys
Yeah we spoke, much more than cordially
Man he broke bread with me, my business spread swiftly
The Feds came to get me, we both fled quickly
Wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
Got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed
Used to call me from the joint til he ran out of change
And when he called collect and I heard his name
I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone
he's talkin reckless, I can sense deceit in his tone
I said, "Damn dawg, what, nine weeks and you're home?"
He said, "Main man, you think shit's sweet cause you're home."
I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone
The crackers up there bleachin' your dome, you're reachin'
I said, "The world don't stop I've got to keep keep on."
From there I sensed the beef was on
I ran to the spot, store to add some more features to my phone
To see if I had bugs and leeches on my phone
Can't be too safe cause niggas is 2-faced
And they show the other side when they catch a new case
It's on Chorus: Too $hort, Jay-Z
It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago Funny what, 7 days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip now you droppin names
Uh-huh, uh-huh It was all good just a week ago Verse 2: Jay-Z
Like I put the toast to your head and made you sell
We both came in this game, blind as hell
I did a little better, had more clientele
Told you put away some cheddar now you cryin' for bail
Seventeen and I'm holdin' on to around a mill
I could bail out and blow trial and come around on Appeal
Had niggas thinkin' I was from Uptown for real
I had so much hustle plus I was down to ill
Like a Brooklyn nigga, straight out of Brownsville
Down and dirty, down to fight the round 30
Freezin on them corners still holdin' my crack
Lookin up and down the block, the fuck is the dough at?
Came from flat broke to lettin the dough stack
You tell them feds I said I'm never goin back
I'm from Marcy, and Marcy don't raise no rats
You know the consequences of your acts, you can't be serious Chorus:
It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago Funny what, 7 days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip now you droppin names
Uh-huh, uh-huh It was all good just a week ago Verse 3: Jay-Z
The lawyer I retained you said you leakin' some things
All this after a week in the bang
I'm mad at myself cause I didn't spot the weak and lame
I woulda bet the house you wouldn't speak a thang
Nigga this was the oath, to the top of broke
Even pricked our finger, anything that got between us
we sposed to cock the ninas, what happened to that?
Instead you copped out to a misdemeanor
Fuck it, the same thing make you laugh make you cry
That's right, the same game that make you mad could make you die
It's a dice game, and sometimes you crap
Who woulda thought you'd get popped one time and rat?
Now you know that's bad when your sister is mad
and your son gotta grow up like, "This is my dad?"
The labelling of a snitch is a lifetime scar
You'll always be in jail nigga, just minus the bars Chorus:
It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago Funny what, 7 days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip now you droppin names
Uh-huh, uh-huh It was all good just a week ago [Too $hort]
Shit is crazy man
All these niggas out here snitchin'
We was one step away from takin' this crack money
and recyclin' it through the ghetto's
and buildin' back up our own hoods
Now all you niggas start snitchin on each other
I got partners doin 15-20
Wouldn't of been doin' shit if you didn't snitch!
Bitch!
It's about time y'all check that shit out man
It ain't all good
Shut your mouth
Just watch the game
And don't snitch
It sure will do a lot for you
Believe that baby
Jay-Z, Short Dawg's in the house main
You know I got it
Got it goin on
We got the money
Ain't got nuthin to do with crime baby
But I'm recognizing [Jay-Z]
You rat bastard! Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind [Chorus: Jay-Z w/ Kanye voiceover]
Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar Now what the hell are you waitin for
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise [Verse One]
Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah hearin me rap is like hearin G. Rap in his prime
I'm, young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand openin, grand closin
God your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him
with no pen just draw off inspiration
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him
with cheap imitations for THESE GENERATIONS [Chorus] - 1/2 {What the hell are you waiting forrrr?} [Verse Two]
{*sighs*} Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yea)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
to be at an all-time high,
perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan, wearin the 4-5
It ain't to play games witchu
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin you to smithereeens
Cocksucker take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold out concerts
So muh'fucker if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore [Interlude: DJ]
OWWWW! It's star time
This man is MADE! He's KILLIN all y'all jive turkeys
Do y'all want more of the Jigga man?
Well if y'all want more of the Jigga man
Then I need y'all to help me, bring him back to stage
Say Hova, c'mon say it!
HO-VA! HO-VA! Are y'all out there? {*crowd chants "HO-VA! HO-VA!"*}
Are y'all out there? C'mon, louder!
Yeah, now see that's what I'm talkin bout
They love you Jigga - they love you Jigga! (Jay-Z)
I like the way this one feel
It's so muh'fuckin soulful man!
(Whoaaaaaahhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh)
Yeah {*crowd still chanting*} okay [Verse Three]
So this here is the victory lap
Then I'm lea-vin, that's how you get me back
After a year of them 16's, it's one point two
And that's two point four, and I'm only doin two
You wanted to gain attention new dudes
I can get you BET and TRL too
You wanna be in the public, send your budget
Well fuck it, I ain't budgin!
Young did it to death, you gotta love it
Record companies told me I couldn't cut it
Now look at me, all star-studded
Golf 4 above par like I putted
All cause the shit I uttered, was utterly ridiculous
How sick is this?
You want to bang, send Kanye change, send Just some ducks
Send Hip a grip, then you got' spit
A little somethin like this, WOO! {What the hell are you waiting forrrr?}
{*piano plays out as crowd cheers loudly*} Let's go
Hov!
Uh huh, Hov'
You, are, not, ready
Hov', unstoppable, Dynasty, young Hova I'm a hustler baby (I'm a hustler)
I just want you to know (Wanna let you know)
It ain't where I been (It aint where I been)
But where I'm bout to go (Top of the world!)
Now I just wanna love you (just wanna love you)
But be who I am (you know you love me)
And with all this cash (mo' money, mo' problems)
You'll forget your man
Now give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff
But don't bullshit me
C'mon, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff When the Remi's in the system, ain't no tellin'
Will I fuck 'em will I diss 'em, that's what they be yellin'
I'm a pimp by blood, not relation
Y'all be chasin', I replace them, huh?
Drunk off Crist', mami on E
Can't keep her little model hands off me
Both in the club, high, singing off key
"And I wish I never met her at all"
It gets better, ordered another round
It's, about, to go, down
Got six model chicks, six bottles of Crist'
Four Belvederes, got weed everywhere
What do you say, me, you, and your Chloe glasses

Young silkk, 'bout to take y'all foos on a journey [silkk the shocker]
Seems it's a trip what niggas 'll do
For a grip in this day and age
See I be tryin' to get paid and
Keep my game sharper than a fade (like that)
Ridin' through the hood in somethin' tight
Like the coupe that's dropped
Have them niggas starin' while they glarin'
When I hit tha block(woo shit)
On my way to check me a motherfuckin' grip
It's about that time
I got my hand upon my nine
Plus my money be on my mind
Stay away from these niggas
That be shady like a tree
I try to show 'em love
And get ta thinkin' they can be me
But a nigga I'll blast you
If I have to(why? )
Because cash rules(damn) [chorus]
[silkk] x2
Another day another dollar
I'm all about that money an power
And if ya feel me then holla
If you can't you's a coward

It's a day another dolla
Another dolla another day [master p]
Dolla dolla
Dolla dolla dolla bill y'all... x3

Dolla dolla bill y'all
Dolla dolla dolla bill y'all [silkk the shocker]
Bitch i'ma g nigga like all tha way

And still cross-over like hardaway
I do more pimpin' than scottie
A nigga fuckin' violent,
Plus I'm silent, so you know a nigga a 'bout it
(whassup, whassup)
And some of these niggas show
They don't understand
Cause if I don't die or
Go to the pen(uh huh)
Shit huh, i'ma be tha man(damn)
And I be quick to hop in
Some gangsta shit(like that)
See if I had a quarter
For ever nigga told me they gonna major
Shit, I be rich
Kinda had flow ons
Them gold thangs spinnin' like some diamonds
With my clique right behind me
Nigga you know, just where to find me
Just tryin' to get a buck,
Comeup on the cut before the taz hit
But I been in this game so long
Shit, I done mastered it
By any means
The more fiends, the more green I have
I just kick back
And watch them, go out and get tha cash
And then I laugh(ha ha ha ha)
I'm just all about my paper [chorus] [silkk the shocker]
I stay tru to tha ghetto
Even if I make a mill'
Cause that's the only place I can go
When I'm broke and I keeps it trill
You besta believe
How I be about my mail(what? )
Whether it be sun out,
Rain, snow, sleet, or hail
You know I gots to, watch my back
And be 'for shure black
(they can't fuck with you)
Beacause it's a proven fact(what? )
That some of these hoes jack(tell 'em)
I stay posted and be major
They trip
Cause how can I have a grip
And only be a teenager
You know they can't fade me
But they will try(nah they can't fuck with you)
Even though I wear a vest
And two straps you know i'ma still die(damn)
But until then I'm 'bout my paper black
Cause ain't no turnin' back
And ain't no savin' that(savin' that)
Can't take nothin' with me
So I guess I'll be a dead g
And ain't need for cryin' over me [chorus] [master p]
Heh, young silkk
T-r-u, heh, we 'bout that money
Tha paper chase you know what I'm sayin'
Breakin' bread, it's all real
We all 'bout tha motherfuckin'
Dividends, dollars, mulah, money, cabbage
Or whateva the fuck you wanna call it You're now tuned into the muh'fuckin greatest
Turn the music up in the headphones
Tim, you can go and brush your shoulder off, nigga
I got you, yeah If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder I probably owe it to y'all, probably be locked by the force
Tryin' to hustle some things that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga, grippin' my balls
Said the ladies, they love me
From the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin', they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin' off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers, they love it, just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom of the bottom, to the top of the pops
Nigga, London, Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back, get it? Man, I'm straight off the block
I can run it back, nigga, 'cause I'm straight with the Roc If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder Your homie Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda
I just whipped up a watch, tryin' to get me a Rover
Tryin' to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yessir
Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya
But, like, 52 cards went out, I'm through dealin'
Now 52 bars come out, now you feel 'em
Now 52 cars roll out, remove ceilin'
In case 52 broads come out, now you chillin'
With a boss, bitch, of course, S.C. on the sleeve
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder Your boy back in the building; Brooklyn, we back on the map
Me and my beautiful bee-itch in the back of that 'Bach
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I ain't gotta clap at 'em, niggas scared of that black
I drop that Black Album, then I back out it
As the best rapper alive, nigga, ask 'bout me
From bricks to Billboards, from grams to Grammy's
From O's to opposite of Orphan Annie
You gotta pardon Jay, for sellin' out the Garden in a day
I'm like a young Marvin in his hey'
I'm a hustler, homie, you a customer crony
Got some dirt on my shoulder; could you brush it off for me? If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder

Best rapper alive, best rapper alive All rhymers with Alzheimers line up please,
All mommies with mind freeze please line up please,
All bloggers with comments,
Please I come in peace,
See if we can kill your amnesia by the time I leave,
All mommies I harbour for vouch for me,
Tell em bout the time all your mommas couch mommy
All hustlas who ever bought an eighth from me,
Take the time out to set the record straight for me,
Remember me, silver bullet hard top mentally
They think think I'm outta shape so I have to jog there memory,
Think with indelible ink, I let the pen go,
Verses permanently tattooed serve as mementos,
Ah, I'm so mental, my track record speaks for itself,
I'm so instrumental,
Allow me to rekindle let's all reminisce like Mary did,
Think I have to send you a reminder,
Here it is, [Chorus:]
Reminder
Reminder,
I got it if you need it,
A reminder
Reminder
Reminder,
Think I better give you a reminder,
Reminder
Reminder,

Cause I can give you a friendly reminder, Ah,
What the hell have you done,
To even have an opinion on what I been doing,
What the hell have y'all won,
Only thing you can identify with is losing,
10 number 1 albums in a row,
Who better than me?
Only the Beatles nobody ahead of me,
I crush Elvis in his blue suede shoes,
Made the rolling stones seem sweet as coolaid 2,
96, 97, 98, 99, 2000, 2001 and beyond,
02, 03, 04, 05, 06 and 7, 08, 09
Back to back double plat, I did what you want,
Men lie women lie, numbers don't,
Ain't nothing changed for me except the year it is,
I think have to send you a reminder, here it is [Chorus:]
Reminder

Cause I can give you a friendly reminder, Do what I done without crying in the environment and what ya'll did it in without dying my n-gga,
Rap like I rap without lying and then tying both together like iron my n-gga,
Write 16's in between running 16 businesses,
All the while showing these young punks what the business is,
As if I'm gonna let you n-ggas style on me,
As if,
Now everybody senile on me,
Go back to boonback,
Remember those button ups,
Young Hov,
Tell them ordinary Joes button up,
I destroy your 4 points O's
And Benz 500 and all points to Ohhhh,
Now you n-ggas 'memba me,
How you forget, back to johnnys album cover,
Red and blue Gucci sh-t,
Ain't nothing changed but the year it is,
I think I have to send you a reminder here it is, [Chorus] Uh uh
So so def
Yeah, yeah In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin' four lanes
With the top down screamin' out
Money ain't a thang Bubble hard in the double are flashin' the rings
With the window cracked, holler back
Money ain't a thang Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam clean
And to hell with the price
'Cause the money ain't a thang Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips
Money ain't a thang Come on, y'all wanna floss wit us
'Cause all across the ball we burn it up
Drop a little paper, baby toss it up
Slackin' on your pimpin', turn it up
See the money ain't a thang I flex the rol', sign a check for yo' hoe
Jigga's style is love, X and O
Save all your accolades, just the dough
My game is wide, all lames aside Tryin' to stay alive, hundred thou' for the bracelet
Foolish, ain't I the chain'll strain ya eye
Twin platinum gun son, aim for the sky
Ice on my bullet, you die soon as I pull it Willies wanna rub shoulders, your money's too young
See me when it gets older, ya bank account grow up
Mine's is one-zero-zero-zero-zero-oh-doub'
Damn near out the rear trunk when I roll up Multi till I close up, it's all basic
I been spending hundreds since they had small faces
Rob your stash house, doubled out down in Vegas
Me and Jay-Z got it locked crazy
Where you at haters? In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin' four lanes
With the top down screamin' out
Money ain't a thang Bubble hard in the double r flashin' the rings
With the window cracked, holler back
Money ain't a thang Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam clean
And to hell with the price
'Cause the money ain't a thang Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips
Money ain't a thang Y'all wanna floss wit us
'Cause all across the ball we burn it up
Drop a little paper, baby toss it up
It's slackin' on your pimpin', turn it up
See the money ain't a thang My cake thick, I live the life
Eatin' crab, watching bitches shake shit all night
I make the big moves, do the big things
Take small groups, turn them into big names The big dog with the big chain, frost bit bracelet to match
Cats say I'm the shit man
The type of nigga that you need in yo' crew
Type of dude that will do shit you won't do, can't do Get more burnt than a candle
Too hot to hold, too much to handle
In the black C-low, he know if she look
She go bye-bye with da-da and I ain't gotta say no more I'm the truth like air, got the proof and stay fly
In the safest shit you could never buy
Know why 'cause I write the songs that the whole world sing
I don't know bout y'all but every night I swing In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin' four lanes
With the top down screamin' out
Money ain't a thang Bubble hard in the double are flashin' the rings
With the window cracked, holler back
Money ain't a thang Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam clean
And to hell with the price
'Cause the money ain't a thang Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips
Money ain't a thang Y'all wanna floss wit us
'Cause all across the ball we burn it up
Drop a little paper, baby toss it up
Slackin' on your pimpin', turn it up
See the money ain't a thang Y'all shit ain't for real till y'all ship a mil'
And ya hit a R&B; chick and she fit the bill
Said she loved my necklace, started relaxin'
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction Went from wholesome to jigga, you owed some
Baby, I don't play all my jewelry is light grey
Platinum, spend your whole life in the day
What's down is a bet, roll the dice Yeah, yeah, so let's play
So what, you went gold and Rock a Roley with the ice bezel
It's gonna take a lot more to see my level
Where I'm at, your check, you better double that And personally your raps is where the trouble at
I'm a Benz bubble cat, leather with the wood grain
In the platinum frame screaming it's not a game
Gleaming, from ear to ear, wrist to wrist, ring and chain
Even me and Jay-z got it locked, crazy In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin' four lanes
With the top down screamin' out
Money ain't a thang Bubble hard in the double r flashin' the rings
With the window cracked, holler back
Money ain't a thang Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam clean
And to hell with the price
'Cause the money ain't a thang Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips
Money ain't a thang Y'all wanna floss wit us
'Cause all across the ball we burn it up
Drop a little paper, baby toss it up
Slackin' on your pimpin', turn it up

You ready B? Let's go get 'em Look for me, Young B
Cruisin' down the westside highway
Doing what we like to do our way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel
It's true to the heart She rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during 'Sex and the City'
She gets Carrie fever but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track mami is keepin me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down the ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down the ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend) The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
Now they 'bout nothin' if ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect, nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid I keep you workin' at Hermes, Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik, Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down the ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down the ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend) Talk to 'em B, if I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if it's somebody was me
Yeah, break it down for 'em
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could've been
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us And I promise I'll give my life
All of my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
All of my trust if you was my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down the ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down the ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend) (Jay Z)

Everybody's like, 'He's no item. Please don't like him
He don't wife 'em, he one nights 'em!'
Now she don't like him, she never met him
Groupies try to take advantage of him, he won't let 'em
He don't need 'em, so he treats 'em like he treats 'em
Better them than me, she don't agree with him
She's mad at that, he's not havin that
So those opposites attract like mag-a-nets
She sees more than the Benz wagon, the friends taggin along
With a flashy nigga braggin on the song
She gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that
He 2 ways her, so she writes back
Smiley faces after all of her phrases
Either she the one or I'm caught in the matrix
Fuck it, let the Fish-burn
Red or green pill, you live and you learn. C'mon! (Pharrell)
Sex-cuse me... damn! (Jay Z)
You gotta throw on your fine linens for this one (Pahrrell)

Lucifer, dawn of the morning! I'm gonna, chase you out of Earth
Lucifer Lucifer, dawn of de morning...
(I'm from the murder capital, where we murder for capital)
Lucifer Lucifer, dawn of the morning! I'm gonna, chase you out of Earth
(Kanyeeze you did it again, you a genius nigga!)
Lucifer Lucifer, dawn of the morning...
So you niggas change your attitude
For they askin what happened to you [Verse One]
Lord forgive him
He got them dark forces in him
But he also got a righteous cause for sinnin'
Them a murder me so i gotta murder them first
Emergency doctors performin procedures
Jesus
I ain't tryin to be facetious
But "Vengance is mine" said the Lord
You said it better than all
Leave niggas on deaths door
Breathin off res-por-rators
for killin my best boy, HATERS
On permanent hiatus as I skate
In the Mabach Benz
Flier than Sanaa Lathan
Pumpin "Brown Sugar" by D'Angelo
In Los Angeles
Like an evangelist
I can introduce you to your maker
Bring you closer to nature
Ashes after they cremate you bastards
Hope you been readin your Psalms and chapters
Payin your tithes being good Catholics
I'm commin [Chorus]
Lucifer, dawn of the morning! I'm gonna, chase you out of Earth
Lucifer Lucifer, dawn of the morning...
(I'm from the murder capital, where we murder for capital)
Lucifer Lucifer, dawn of the morning! I'm gonna, chase you out of Earth
Lucifer Lucifer, dawn of the morning...
So you niggas change your attitude
For they askin what happened to you [Verse Two]
Yes
This is Holy war
I wet cha all with the Holy water
Spray from the Heckler, Koch auto
Matic all the static shall cease to exist
Like a sematical I throw a couple at you
Take six
Spread love to all of my dead thugs
I'll pour out a little Louis til I head above
Yes Sir
And when I perish
The meek shall inherit the earth
Until that time it's on a poppin - Church
Like Don Bishop
The fifth upon cock either
Lift up your soul or give the Holy ghost please
I leave ya in somebody's Cathedral
And stuntin like Evil Kenevil
I'll let you see where that bright light lead you
The more you talk the more you irkin us
The more you gonna need memorial services
The Black Albums second verse is like
Devil's Pie save some dessert for us [Breakdown]
Man I gotta get my soul right
I gotta get these Devils out my life
These cowards gonna make a nigga ride
They won't be happy til somebody dies Man I gotta get my soul right
'For I'm locked up for my whole life
Every time it seems it's all right
Somebody want they soul to rise
(I'll chase you off of this Earth) [Verse Three]
I got dreams of holdin a Nine milla
To Bobs killa
Askin him "why?" as my eyes fill up
These days i can't wake up with a dry pillow
Gone but not forgotten holmes i still feel ya
SO... curse the day that birthed the bastard
Who caused your Church mass
Reverse the crash
Reverse the blast
And reverse the car
Reverse the day, and there you are
Bob Allah
Lord forgive him. we all have sinned
But Bob's a good dude please let him in
And if you feel in my heart that i long for revenge
Please blame it on the sun of the morning
Thanks Again [Intro: Gloria Carter]
Shawn Carter was born December 4th
Weighing in at ten pounds, eight ounces
He was the last of my four children
The only one who didn't give me any pain, when I gave birth to him
And that's how I knew, that he was a special child "Hi baby, what's wrong? You look like, you've lost your best friend
Tell me, is it something that I've done again?
You look like, you've lost your best friend
Tell me." [Verse One: Jay-Z]
They say they never really miss you 'til you dead or you gone
So on that note I'm leavin after this song
See you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay so long
At least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on
I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnus Reeves
Who made love under the sycamore tree
Which makes me, a more sicker MC and my momma would claim
At ten pounds when I was born I didn't give her no pain
Although through the years I gave her her fair share
I gave her her first real scare, I made up for birth when I got here
She knows my purpose was on purpose, I ain't perfect, I care
But I feel worthless cause my shirts wasn't matchin my gear
Now I'm just scratchin the surface cause what's buried under there
Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
I went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted
But I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted
Hold on [Interlude: Gloria Carter]
Shawn was a very shy child growing up
He was into sports, and a funny story is
At four, he taught himself how to ride a bike
A two-wheel at that, isn't that special?
But, I noticed a change in him. when me and my husband, broke up [Verse Two: Jay-Z]
Now all the teachers couldn't reach me and my momma couldn't beat me
Hard enough to match the pain of my pop not seein me SO!
With disdain in my membrane
Got on my pimp game, fuck the world, my defense came
Then the Haven introduced me to the game
Spanish Jose introduced me to 'caine; I'm a hustler now
My gear is in, and I'm in the in-crowd
And all the wavy light-skinned girls is lovin me now
My self-esteem went through the roof, man I got my swag'
Got a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged
Plus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had
supposedly - knowin nobody paid Jaz wack ass
I'm gettin ahead of myself, by the way, I could rap
That came second to me movin this crack
Give me a second I swear, I would say about my rap career
'til ninety-six came, niggaz I'm here - goodbye! [Interlude: Gloria Carter]
Shawn used to be in the kitchen, beating on the table and rapping
And umm, into the wee hours of the morning
And then I brought him a boombox
And his sisters and brothers said that he would drive them nuts
But, that was my way to keep him close to me, and out of trouble [Verse Three: Jay-Z]
Goodbye to the game all the spoils, the adrenaline rush
Your blood boils, you in a spot, knowin cops could rush
at you in the drop, you so easy to touch
No two days are alike, except the 1st and 15th pretty much
And trust, is a word you seldom hear from us
Hustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up
And a drought could define a man when the well dries up
You learn the worth of water
Without work you thirst 'til you die - YUP!
And niggaz get tied up for product
And little brothers ring fingers get cut up
to show mothers they really got 'em
And this is the stress I lived with
'til I decided to try this rap shit for a livin
I pray I'm forgiven - for every bad decision I made
Every sister I played - cause I'm still paranoid to this day
And it's nobody fault, I made the decisions I've made
This is the life I chose, or rather the life that chose me [Outro: Fades out]
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is whack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is whack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
Now if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is whack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is whack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black. Je t'adore! Je t'adore! Girls I love you. I love all y'all Hehehe, hehehe, for real
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, I do adore Yo put your number on this paper cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour, yeah

So she call me cabron plus marricon
Said she likes to cook rice so she likes me home
I'm like, "Un momento" mami, slow up your tempo
I got this Black chick, she don't know how to act
Always talkin' out her neck, makin' her fingers snap
She like, "Listen Jigga Man, I don't care if you rap
You better - R-E-S-P-E-C-T me"
I got this French chick that love to french kiss
She thinks she's Bo Derek, wear her hair in a twist
My, cherie amor, tu es belle
Merci, you fine as fuck but you givin' me hell
I got this Indian squaw the day that I met her
Asked her what tribe she with, red dot or feather
She said "All you need to know is I'm not a ho."
And to get with me you better be Chief Lots-a-Dough
Now that's Spanish chick, French chick, Indian and Black
That's fried chicken, curry chicken, damn I'm gettin' fat Arroz con pollo, french fries and crêpe An appetitite for destruction but I scrape the plate

Girls, girls, girls, girls (uh-huh)
Girls, I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls all over the globe I come scoop you in that Coupe, sittin' on two-zeroes
Fix your hair in the mirror, let's roll - c'mon
I got this young chick, she so immature
She like, "Why you don't buy me Reeboks no more?"
Like to show out in public, throw tantrums on the floor
Gotta toss a couple dollars, just to shut up her holla
Got a project chick, that plays her part
And if it goes down y'all that's my heart
Baby girl so thorough she been with me from the start
Hid my drugs from the NARCs, hid my guns by the parts
I got this model chick that don't cook or clean
But she dress her ass off and her walk is mean
Only thing wrong with ma she's always on the scene
God damn she's fine but she parties all the time
I get frequent flier mileage from my stewardess chick
She look right in that tight blue dress, she's thick
She gives me extra pillows and seat back love
So I had to introduce her to the Mile High Club Now that's young chick, stewardess, project and model
That means I fly rough early, plus I know Tae-bo
That means I'm new school, pop pills and stay in beef But I never have a problem with my first class seat
I love
Girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, I do adore Yo put your number on this paper cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls all over the globe I come scoop you in that Coupe, sittin' on two-zeroes
Fix your hair in the mirror, let's roll
I got this paranoid chick, she's scared to come to the house
A hypochondriac who says ouch before I whip it out
Got a chick from Peru, that sniff fufu
She got a cousin at customs that get shit through
Got this weedhead chick, she always catch me doin' shit
Crazy girl wanna leave me but she always forgets
Got this Chinese chick, had to leave her quick
Cause she kept bootleggin' my shit - man
I got this African chick with Eddie Murphy on her skull She like, "Jigga Man, why you treat me like animal?"
I'm like excuse me Ms. Fufu, but when I met your ass
You was dead broke and naked, and now you want half
I got this ho that after twelve million sold
Mami's a narcolyptic, always sleepin' on Hov' Gotta tie the back of her head like Deuce Bigalow

You can learn how to dress just by checkin' my fresh
Checkin', checkin' my fresh; checkin', checkin' my fresh
Follow my steps is the road to success
Where the niggas know you're thorough when the girls say yes (yes)
But I can't teach you my swag
You can pay for school but you can't buy class
School of hard knocks: I'm a grad

Now when it comes to styles, I got several
Sharper than the swag or dagger all metal

That's right; aye
You can go see Weezy for the wordplay
Jeezy for the bird play
Kanyeezy for diversity
And me for controversy
All my verses picture perfect
Only spit to serve a purpose
You ain't livin' what you kickin' then you worthless
Looking from the surface it may seem like I got reason to be nervous
Then observe my work to see that my adversity was worth it
s autobiographical
Absolutely classical
Last thing I'm worried about is what another rapper do
Ain't nobody hot as me
Even if they rap they ass off
Blast off and have outstanding quality
Sell a lotta records, I'll respect it and salute that
But spitting real life on hot beats I'm the truth at
You kick it like me, no exaggeration necessary
Livin' revolutionary, nuttin' less than legendary
Gangsta shit hereditary, got it from my dad
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag [Pain In Da Ass]
[*gunshots*] OKAY, I'M RELOADED!
You motherfuckers, think you big time?
Fuckin with Jay-Z, you gon' die, big time!

The number one question is can the Feds get us (uh-huh)
I got vendettas in dice games against ass betters (uh-huh)
and niggaz who pump wheels and drive Jettas
Take that witcha. [Notorious B.I.G.]
. hit ya, back split ya
Fuck fist fights and lame scuffles
Pillow case to your face, make the shell muffle
Shoot your daughter in the calf muscle
Fuck a tussle, nickel-plated
Sprinkle coke on the floor, make it drug related
Most hate it. [Jay-Z]
. can't fade it
While y'all pump Willie, I run up in stunts silly
Scared, so you sent your little mans to come kill me
But on the contrilli, I packs the mack-milli
Squeezed off on him, left them paramedics breathin soft on him
What's ya name? [Notorious B.I.G.]
. Who shot ya? Mob ties like Sinatra
Peruvians tried to do me in, I ain't paid them yet
Tryin to push 700's, they ain't made them yet
Rolex and bracelets is frostbit; rings too
Niggaz 'round the way call me Igloo Stix (Who?)
Motherfucker! [Chorus]
Jay-Z and Biggie Smalls, nigga shit ya drawers
(Where you from?) Brooklyn, goin out for all

(Jigga) Jay-Z [Notorious B.I.G.]
. and Bigga baby!
My Bed-Stuy flow's malicious, delicious
Fuck three wishes, made my road to riches

Gram choppin, police van dockin
D's at my doors knockin [Jay-Z]
What? Keep rockin
No more, Mister, Nice Guy, I twist your shit
the fuck back with them pistols, blazin
Hot like cajun
Hotter than even holdin work at the Days Inn
with New York plates outside
Get up outta there, fuck your ride [Notorious B.I.G.]
Keep your hands high, shit gets steeper
Here comes the Grim Reaper, Frank Wright
Leave the keys to your In-tegra (That's right)
Chill homie, the bitch in the Shoney's told me
You're holdin more drugs than a pharmacy, you ain't harmin me
So pardon me, pass the safe, before I blaze the place
and here's six shots just in case
(Brooklyn... Brooklyn... Brooklyn...) [Chorus]
Jay-Z and Biggie Smalls, nigga shit ya drawers
(Where you from?) Brooklyn goin out to all

Made a fortune off Peru, extradite, china white heron
Nigga please, like short sleeves I bear arms
Stay out my way from here on (CLEAR?) Gone! [Notoriuos B.I.G.]
Me and Gutter had two spots
The two for five dollar hits, the blue tops
Gotta go, Coolio mean it's gettin "Too Hot"
If Fay' had twins, she'd probably have two-Pac's
Get it? . Tu-pac's [Jay-Z]
Time to separate the pros from the cons
The platinum from the bronze
That butter soft shit from that leather on the Fonz
A S1 diamond from a eye class don
A Cham' Dom' sipper from a Rosay nigga, huh?!
Brook-Nam, sippin on [Notorious B.I.G.]
Cristal forever, play the crib when it's mink weather
The M.A.F.I.A. keep canons in they Marc Buchanans
Usually cuatro cinco, the shell sink slow, tossin ya
Mad slugs through your Nautica, I'm warnin ya
(Hah, what the fuck?) [Chorus]
Jay-Z and Biggie Smalls, nigga shit ya drawers
(Where you from?) Brooklyn goin out to all

{*"Is Brooklyn in the house?"*} [Outro]
Uhh, Roc-A-Fella, y'all, Junior M.A.F.I.A.
Superbad click, Brook-lyn's Finest, you re-wind this
Represetin BK to the fullest Dreamed of you this mornin'
Then came the dawn and I thought you were here with me
If you could only see how much I love you
That's all, that's all, baby Oh no, I'll never give up on you
(I never felt that before)
Oh no, I'll never give up on you
(I never felt that before) Oh no, I'll never give up on you
(I never felt that before)
But there's always
(That's all that's all) This is the shit you dream about with the homie steamin' out
Back-back-backin' them Beemer's out
Seems as our plans to get a grant
Then go off to college, didn't pan or even out We need it now, we need a town
We need a place to pitch, we need a mound
For now, I'm just a lazy boy
Big dreamin' in my La-Z-Boy In the clouds of smoke, been playin' this Marvin
Mama forgive me, should be thinkin' 'bout Harvard
But that's too far away, niggas are starvin'
Ain't nothin' wrong with aim, just gotta change the target I got dreams of baggin' snidd-ow the size of pillows
I see pies every time my eyes clidd-ose
I see rides, sixes, I gotta get those
Life's a bitch, I hope that I make her over, though Oh no, I'll never give up on you
(I never felt that before)
American dreamin'
Oh no, I'll never give up on you
(I never felt that before)
It's just American dreamin' Oh no, I'll never give up on you
(I never felt that before)
American dreamin'
But there's always
(That's all, that's all) Now see, the life's right there
And it seems right there, it's not quite near
And it's not like we're professionals movin' the decimals
Know where to cop? Nah, got a connect? No Who under heaven knows how to be successful
Need a Personal Jesus, I'm in Depeche Mode
They say it's celestial, it's all in the stars
Like Tony Caruso, how you played the card Y'all ain't fuckin' with me
The ironies are, had all coast better before he was bars
Now let's start, on your mark
Get set, let's go, get out the car Goin' in circles, it's a vicious cycle
This is a crash course, this ain't high school
Wake up, Muttley, you're dreamin' again
Your own reality show, the season begins Oh no, I'll never give up on you
(I never felt that before)
American dreamin'
Oh no, I'll never give up on you
(I never felt that before)
It's just American dreamin' Oh no, I'll never give up on you
(I never felt that before)
American dreamin'
But there's always
(That's all, that's all) Step one in this process, scramble up in your projects
And head to the heights where big coke is processed
You gotta convince 'em that you not from the Precinct
Please speak slow, 'cause he no speakey no English If he takes a likin' after a couple of trips
If your money is straight, he's gon' give you consignment
You're now in a game where only time can tell
Survive the droughts, I wish you well Survive the droughts, I wish you well
How sick am I? I wish you health
I wish you wheels, I wish you wealth
I wish you insight so you could see for yourself You could see the signs, when the jackets is schemin'
And the cops is comin', you could read their mind
You could see from behind, you could redefine
The game as we know it, one dream at a time, I'm American dreamin' Oh no, I'll never give up on you
(I never felt that before)
American dreamin'
Oh no, I'll never give up on you
(I never felt that before)
American dreamin' Oh no, I'll never give up on you
(I never felt that before)
American dreamin'
But there's always
(That's all, that's all)
American dreamin' Oh baby
But there's always
(That's all, that's all)
But there's always
(That's all, that's all) Life is but a dream to me I don't wanna wake up
30 odd years without having my cake up
So I'm bout my paper
24/7, 365, 366 in a leap year
I don't know why we here
Since we got a beat here
Life is but a beach chair (chair, chair, chair)
Went from having shabby clothes
To crossing over Abbey Road
Hear my angels singing to me (are you happy Hov?)
I just hope I'm hearing right
Karma's got me fearing life
Khalik are you praying for me
See I got demons in my past so I got daughters on the way
If the prophecy's correct than the child shall have to pay
For the sins of the father
So I barter my tomorrows against my yesterdays
In hopes that she'll be O.K.
And when I'm no longer here
To shade her face from the glare
I'll give her my share of Carol's Daughter
And a new beach chair (I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up (wake up)
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna lose
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up (wake up)
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna lose Life is but a dream to me
Gun shots sing to these
Other guys but lullabies don't mean a thing to me
I'm not afraid of dyin'
I'm afraid of not tryin'
Everyday hit every wave like I'm Hawaiian
I don't surf the net
No I never been on Myspace
Too busy letting my voice vibrate
Carving out my space
In this world of fly girls
Cut throats in diamond cut ropes I twirls
Business round corners where the sun don't shine
I let the wheels give a glimpse of hope in ones grind
Some said "Hov how you get so fly?"
I said from not being afraid to fall out the sky
My physical's a shell so when I say farewell
My soul will find an even higher plane to dwell
So fly you shall so have no fear
Just know that life is but a beach chair (chair, chair, chair) (I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up (wake up)
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna lose
Life is but a dream
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up (wake up)
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna lose
Life is but a dream Life is but a dream can't mimic my life
I'm the thinnest cut slice
Intercut, the Winner's Cup
Where winter's rough enough to interrupt life
That's why I'm both saint and sinner... nice
This is Jay every day no compromise
No compass comes with this life just eyes
So to map it out you must look inside
Sure books can guide you but your heart defines you chica
The corazón is what brought us home
In great shape like Heidi Klum, maricon, I am on
Permanent vaca', life is but a beach chair
Song's like a Hallmark card until you reach here
So till she's here
And she's declared
The heir
I will prepare
A blueprint for you to print a map for you to get back
A guide for your eyes
So you won't lose scent
I'll make a stink for you to think
I ink these verses
Full of prose so you won't get conned out of 2 cents
My last will and testament I leave my heir
My share of Roc-a-fella Records and a shiny new beach chair (I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up (wake up)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna lose
Life is but a dream
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up (wake up)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna lose
Life is but a dream Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up (wake up)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna lose
Life is but a dream
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up (wake up)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna lose
Life is but a dream (I hear my angels sing)
(I hear my angels sing)
(I hear my angels sing) Uh, uh, so so Def

I wanna Rothko, no I wanna brothel
No, I want a wife that fuck me like a prostitute
Let's make love on a million, in a dirty hotel
With the fan on the ceiling, all for the love of drug dealing
Marble Floors, gold Ceilings
Oh what a feeling, fuck it I want a billion
Jeff Koons balloons, I just wanna blow up
Condos in my condos, I wanna row of

Champagne on my breath, Yes
House like the Louvre or the Tate Modern

The modern day version
Yellow Basquiat in my kitchen corner

Jay, comment tu dis nombre d'or?" "The golden number." "Touché." OK! I never stuck my cock in the fox's box but
Damned if I ain't open Pandora's box
They try to slander your man
On CNN and Fox
My Mirandas don't stand a chance, with cops
Even my old fans like old man just stop
I could if I would but I can't
I'm hot, and you blow
I'm still the man to watch, Hublot
On my left hand or not
Soon I step out the booth
The cameras pops niggas is cool with it
Till the canons pop
Now my hand on the Bible
On the stand got your man in a jam, again
Got my hands in cuff
I'm like god damn enough
I put down the cans and they ran amok
My hairpin pierce skin, ruptures spleens
Cracks ribs, go through cribs, and other things
No sympathy for the king, huh?
Niggas even talk about your baby crazy
Eventually the pendulum swings
Don't forget America this how you made me
Come through with the 'Ye mask on
Spray everything like SAMO
I won't scratch the Lambo
What's it gon take
For me to go
For you to see
I'm the modern day Pablo Who wants that perfect love story any way, anyway
Clich, Clich
Clich, Clich
Who wants that hero love that saves the day, anyway
Clich, Clich
Clich, Clich
What about the bad guy goes good, yeah
And the missing missing love that's misunderstood, yeah
Black hour glass, our glass
Toast to clichs in a dark past
Toast to clichs in a dark past Boy meets girl, girl perfect women
Girl get the bustin' before the cops come running
Chunking deuces, chugging D'USSE
Fuck what you say, boys in blue say I don't care if you on the run
Baby as long as I'm next to you
And if loving you is a crime
Tell me why do I bring out

Last night I had a dream
Thoughts was racin through my head
It was all a dream
Felt so real to me
This is what was said Had a dream I said, 'bout who he said?
'Bout B.I.G. I said, that's B, I.G. he said
Dig he said, proceed he said
Indeed I said, so, breathe I did
Don't repeat what I say I said, he said nothin'
He agreed with his head, he just nodded like this
What I believe to be a yes I re-peated what was said
It came to me like a, well as even I said "You feel playboy," was the greeting he said
First thing I wanted to know, what's the reason he was dead?
"More money, more problems, better believe it," he said
"Careful what you wish for you might receive it," he said I see I said, jealousy I said
Got the whole industry mad at me I said
Then B.I. said, "Hov' remind yourself
Nobody built like you, you designed yourself"
I agree I said, my one of a kind self
Get stoned every day like Jesus did
What he said, I said, has been said before
"Just keep doin' your thing," he said, say no more Was it all a dream
Was it all a dream
Was it all a dream
Was it all a dream
Was it all a dream
Was it all a dream It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt 'n' Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday, "Rap Attack," Mr. Magic, Marley Marl I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed and bamboo, sippin' on private stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? "Duh-ha, duh-ha"
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the, Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood, it's all good
Uhh, and if you don't know
Now you know, nigga Was it all a dream
Was it all a dream
Was it all a dream
Was it all a dream
Was it all a dream
Was it all a dream It was all a dream
It was all
It was all, all a dream
It was all a dream
It was all, all a dream
It was all
It was all, all a dream I see I said, jealousy I said
Got the whole industry mad at me I said
Then B.I. said, "Hov' remind yourself
Nobody built like you, you designed yourself"
I agree I said, my one of a kind self
Get stoned every day like Jesus did
What he said, I said, has been said before
"Just keep doin' your thing," he said, say no more (Movie)

Before the Basquiat show and if so
Well fuck it, fuck it
Because this water drown my family
This water mixed my blood
This water tells my story
This water knows it all
Go ahead and spill some champagne in the water
Go ahead and watch the sun blaze
On the waves of the ocean Dope boy still smelling like cocaina
White boat, white robe

The oil spill that BP ain't clean up
I'm anti-Santa Maria
Only Christopher we acknowledge is Wallace
I don't even like Washingtons in my pocket
Black card go hard when I'm shopping
Boat dock in front of Hermes picking cotton
Silk and fleeces, lay on my Jesus

Aww, whole world's in awe

I'm on the ocean, I'm in heaven
Yachting, Ocean 11 I see elephant tusk on the bow of a sailing lady
Docked on the Ivory Coast
Mercedes in a row winding down the road
I hope my black skin don't dirt this white tuxedo
Before the Basquiat show and if so
Well fuck it, fuck it
Because this water drown my family
This water mixed my blood
This water tells my story
This water knows it all

If I'mma make it to a billi I can't take the same route
Swoosh, that's the sound of the border
Swoosh, and that's the sound of a baller
Muhammad Hovi my back against the rope
The black Maybach, I'm back inside the boat
Shepard Fairey they finally gave me some hope
Can't believe they got a nigga to vote
Democrat, nope, I sold dope
In trouble waters I had to learn how to float
On the ocean, I'm in heaven
Yachting, Ocean 11 I see elephant tusk on the bow of a sailing lady
Docked on the Ivory Coast
Mercedes in a row winding down the road
I hope my black skin don't dirt this white tuxedo
Before the Basquiat show and if so
Well fuck it, fuck it
Because this water drown my family
This water mixed my blood
This water tells my story
This water knows it all
Go ahead and spill some champagne in the water
Go ahead and watch the sun blaze
On the waves of the ocean (Chorus) (Jay-Z)
Now that all the smoke is gone (lighta)
And the battle's finally won (gimme a lighta)
Victory is finally ours (lightas up)
(lightas up) History so long so long
so long, so long In search of victory, she keeps saluting me
If only we can be together momentarily
We can make love, and make history
Why won't you visit me, until she visit me
I'll be stuck with her sister, her name is defeat
She gives me agony, so much agony
She brings me so much pain, so much misery
Like missing your last shot, and falling to your knees
As the crowd screams, for the other team
I practiced so hard for this moment victory don't leave
I know what this means, I'm stuck in this routine
Whole new different day, the same old thing
All I got is dreams, nobody else can see
Nobody else believes, nobody else but me
Where are you victory, I need you desperately
Not just for the moment, to make history (Chorus) (Jay-Z)
Now that all the smoke is gone (lighta)
And the battle's finally won (lightas)
Victory is finally ours (yeah)
History so long so long (yeah)
(yeah) So long, so long So now I'm flirting with death
Hustling like a G while victory wasn't watching took chances repeatedly
As a teenage boy, before acne, before I got proactive I couldn't face she
I just threw on my hoody, and headed to the street
I swear I met success we lived together shortly
Now success was like lust, she's good to the touch
She's good for the moment but she's never enough
Everybodys had her, she's nothing like V
But success is all I got, unfortunately
But I'm burning down the block, hoping in and out of V
But something tells me, there is much more to see
Before I get killed, cause I can't get robbed
So before me, success and death ménage
I gotta get lost, I gotta find V
We gotta be together, to make history (Chorus) (Jay-Z)
Now that all the smoke is gone (lighter sup)
And the battle finally won (lighter up)
Victory is finally ours (lighters up)
History so long so long
So long, so long Now victory is mine, taste so sweet
She's my trophy wife, your coming with me
We'll have a baby, who stutters repeatedly
We'll name him history, he'll repeat after me
He's my legacy, son of my hard work
Future of my past, that'll explain who I'll be
Rank me amongst the greats, either one two or three
If I ain't number one, then I've failed you victory
Ain't in it for the fame, that dies within weeks
Ain't in it for the money, can take it when you leave
I want to be remembered, long after you breathe
Long after I'm gone, long after I breathe
I leave all I am, in the hands of history
That's my last will, testimony
This is much more than a song, It's a baby shower
I've been waiting for this hour, history of ours (Chorus x2)
Now that all the smoke is gone
And the battle's finally won
Victory is finally ours
History so long so long
so long, so long Uh-huh, je-je je-je-jeah
Ye-ye-yeah, ye-ye-yeah
How real is this, how real is this
Uh-huh huh, inspect this here, check I'm from where the hammer's rung, news cameras never come
You and your man houndin' every verse in your rhyme
Where the grams is slung, niggas vanish every summer
Where the blue vans would come, we throw the work in the can and run Where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set
To achieve this goal quicker, sold all my weight wet
Faced with immeasurable odds still I get straight bets
So I felt there more something and you nothing check I from the other side with other guys don't walk to much
And girls in the projects wouldn't fuck us if we talked too much
So they ran up the town and then sought them dudes to trust
I don't know what the fuck they thought those niggas is foul just like us I'm from where the beef is inevitable, summertime's unforgettable
Boosters in abundance, buy a half-price sweater new
Your world was everything, so everything you said you'd do
You did it, couldn't talk about it if you ain't lived it I from where niggas pull your car, and argue all day about
Who's the best Mc's, Biggie, Jay-Z, and Nas
Where the drugs czars evolve and thugs always are
At each other's throats for the love of foreign cars Where cats catch cases, hoping the judge R and R's
But most times find themselves locked up behind bars
I'm from where they ball and breed rhyme stars
I'm from Marcy Son, just thought I'd remind y'all Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice I'm from the place where the church is the flakiest
And niggas is praying to God so long that they atheist
Where you can't put your vest away and say you'll wear it tomorrow
'Cause the day after we'll be saying, damn I was just with him yesterday I'm a block away from hell, not enough shots away from straight shells
An ounce away from a triple beam still using a hand-held weight scale
Your laughing, you know the place well
Where the liquor store's and the base well
And government, fuck government, niggas polotic themselves Where we call the cops the a-team
'Cause they hop out of vans and spray things
And life expectancy so low we making out wills at eight-teen
Where how you get rid of guys who step out of line, your rep solidifies So tell me when I rap you think I give a fuck who criticize?
If the shit is lies, God strike me
And I got a question, are you forgiving guys who live just like me?
We'll never know One day I pray to you and said if I ever blow, let 'em know
Mistakes ain't exactly what takes place in the ghetto
Promise fulfilled, but still I feel my job ain't done
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy Son, ain't nothing nice Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy Son, ain't nothing nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy Son, ain't nothing nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice Check, I'm from where they cross-over and clap boards
Lost Jehovah in place of rap Lords, listen
I'm up the block, round the corner and down the street
From where the pimps, prostitutes, and the drug Lords meet We make the million off of beats, 'cause our stories is deep
And fuck tomorrow, long as the night before was sweet
Niggas get lost for weeks in the streets, twisted off weed
And no matter the weather, niggas know how to draw heat Whether your four-feet or minute size
It always starts out with three dice and shoot the five
Niggas thought they douce was live, now hit 'em with trips
Then I reached down for their money, pa forget about this This time around it's platinum, like the shit on my wrist
And this glock on my waist, y'all can't do shit about this
Niggas will show you love, that's how they fool thugs
Before you know it you're lying in a pool of blood Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy Son, ain't nothing nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy Son, ain't nothing nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy Son, ain't nothing nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy Son, ain't nothing nice R.O.C., we runnin this rap shit

Niggaz said, "Bryan leave your cousin in the house"
Everytime we play the Dozen, he's buggin out
While y'all was playin yo-yo, I was sittin on low pros

And keep your ass tighter than Versace thats why
You gotta watch your friends you got to watch me

They try me, all they get is 50 cent franks
And papayas, from the village to the tele

Tailor made so we can lay up in the shade reminiscin
On how I fuck the best a shit
Specially when Im flippin Baileys
Dont give a fuck about how you move with them other mamis

Fuck them Reebok broads, you made it known who your wife was
I got you frontin in Armani sweaters
Before this rap shit

And eek classes with mo in the glasses
Shows in Cali wit all the flavor suede Bally's
Now all your mens' up in your benz's
High post, I swear you be killin me
Playin inside my pubic hairs
I never worry bout them other chicks
'Cause you proved who was your wiz

All them collects have me vex

Holdin this grip cocked the green and the shit
Fucks no, I see half the dough
Made you into a star, pushin hundred thousand dollar cars Aint no nigga like the one I got

Sleeps around but he gives me alot
Keeps you in diamonds and leathers
Friends 'ill tell me I should leave you alone
Hah hah, hah hah, hah hah, hah ha
Tell the freaks to find a man of there own
(Man a they own, man a they own) Yeah 3 in the morning on the Westside highway, top down baby,
F-ck y'all
The motivation for me was them telling me what I couldn't be,
Oh well, This a special dedication,
I wanna thank you for the fuel,
No really thank you, I felt so inspired by what my teacher said,
Said I'd either be dead or be a reefer head,
Now sure if that's how adults should speak ta kids,
Especially when the only thing I did was speak in class,
I teach his ass,
Even betters what my uncle did,
I pop my demo tape in start to beat my head,
Peaked out my eye, see if he was beating his,
He might as well say beat it kid, he's on the list,
It's like I'm searching for kicks like a sneaker head,
He gon keep pushing me until I reach the ledge,
And when I reach the ledge I'll tell em all to eat a d-ck,
Take a leap of faith and let my eagle wings spread,
Spread spread. Motivation for me was them telling me what I could not be,
Oh well,
I'm so ambitious,
I might hit two sisters,
Hey I'm on a mission
No matter what the conditions,
Forget the personal issues
When you been what I been through,
Hey if you believe it,
Then you could conceive it. I had to lace up my boots even harder,
Father is too far away to father,
Further-more of the kids either smoke reefer,
Or either move white, there's few writers in my cipher,
So they made lighter, my type a dreams seem dumb
They said wise up, how many guys a you see making it from here,
The world don't like us, is that not clear, alright,
But I'm different, I can't base what I'm gonna be off a what everybody isn't, they don't listen, just whispering behind my back,
No vision, lack of ambition,
So wack! Had a couple of meetings no offers yet,
Maybe I ain't good enough for these offices,
Back to the drawing board ducking officers,
It's all good cause the streets is A&R;'ing this,
So with or without any of your involvement,
Coming for all of this, respect my conglomerate,
I went from pauper to the President,
Every deal I ever made set precedent,
N-ggas thought I'd fall without old buddy,
Oh buddy, what I do is make more money,
Dear Teacher, your probably somewhere near a speaker,
I'm balling outta control, can you hear my sneakers,

Shunning the one thing that they owe they life to/
You let that man hype you to go against your idol/ Knowing good and god damn well this what I do/
Think I'm in the office I'm off my grind/
That's how kids become orphans, YOU LOST YOUR MIND!?/

Burry yourself Turn my music high, high, high, high-er
You don't know... what you're doing, doing, doing, doing
Sure i do... I'm from the streets where the
Hood could swallow a man, bullets'll follow are followin' me
There's so much coke that you could run the slalom
And cops comb the shit top to bottom
They say that we are prone to violence, but it's home sweet
Where personalities clash and chorme meets chorme
The coke prices up and down like it's wall street homes
But this is worse than the Dow Jones your brains are now blown
All over that brown brome, one slip you are now gone
Welcome to hell where you are welcome to sell
But when them shells come you better return 'em
All scars we earn 'em, all cars we learn 'em like the back of our hand
We watch for cops hoppin out the back of van
Wear a G on my chest, I don't need Dapper Dan
This ain't a sewn outfit homes, homes is about it
Was clappin them flamers before I became famous
For playin me y'all shall forever remain nameless
I am Hov' Sure I do, I tell you the difference between me and them
They tryin to get they ones, tryin to get them M's
One million, two million, three miliion, four
In just five years, forty million more
You are now lookin at the forty million boy
I'm rapin Def Jam 'til I'm the hundred million man
R., O., C. You don't know. what you're doing, doing, doing, doing
That's where you're wrong I came into this muthafucka a hundred grand strong
Nine to be exact, from grindin G-packs
Put this shit in motion ain't no rewindin me back
Could make 40 off a brick but one rhyme could beat that
And if somebody woulda told 'em that Hov' would sell clothes
Heh, not in this lifetime, wasn't in my right mind
That's another difference that's between me and them
Heh, I smartened up, opened the market up
One million, two million, three million, four
In eighteen months, eighty million more
Now add that number up with the one I said before
You are now lookin at one smart black boy
Momma ain't raised no fool
Put me anywhere on God's green earth, I'll triple my worth
Muthafucka - I.will.not.lose You don't know. what you're doing, doing, doing, doing
Put somethin on it I sell ice in the winter, i sell fire at hell
I am a hustler baby, I'll sell water to a well
I was born to get cake, move on and switch states
Cop the coupe with the roof go on and switch plates
Was born to dictate, never follow orders
Dickface, get your shit straight, fucka this is Big Jay
I. hahahaha.hahaha You don't know. what you're doing, doing, doing, doing
. will, not, lose, ever. fucka! Thank you,Thank you,Thank you,You're far to kind. [Chorus]
Now can I get an encore,do you want more
Cooking raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time i need ya'll to roar Now what the hell are you waiting for
After me there will be no more
So for one last time,nigga make some noise [Verse 1] get 'em jay
Who you know fresher than HOV'?Riddle me that
The rest of ya'll know where i'm lyrically at
Can't none of ya'll mirror me back
Ya'll hearing me rap is like hearing G.Rap in his prime
I'm Young H.O.,Raps grateful dead
Back to take over the globe,Now break bread
I'm in,Boeing jets,Global express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the louvre but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you young,what the fuck you expect,Yep yep
Grand opening,Grand closing
God damn your man HOV' cracked the can open again
Who you gone find doper than him with no pen
Just draw off inspiration
Soon you gonna see you can't replace him
With cheap imitations for these generations [Chorus 1/2] {What the hell are you waiting for?} [Verse 2]
Look what you made me do,Look what i made for you
Knew if i paid my dues,How will they pay you
When you first come into the game,They try to play you
They drop you a couple of hits,Look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madision square
To the only thing that matters is just a matter of years (yea)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all time high,Perfect time to say goodbye
When i come back like Jordan,Wearing the 4-5
It aint to play games with you
It's to aim at you,Probaly maim you
If i owe you i'm blowing you to smitheriens
Cocksuker take one for your team
And i need you to remember one thing
I came i saw i conquered
From record sales to sold out concerts
So motherfucker if you want this encore
I need you to scream,til your lungs get sore. [Lnkin' Park]
Tired of being who you want me to be
Feeling so faithless,Lost under the surface
Dont know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(calling yhe undertow jus callin' the undertow)
Every step that i take is another mistake to you
(callin the undertow jus callin the undertow)
And every second i waste is more than i can take I've become so numb i cant feel you there
Become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this,All i want to do is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb [Jay-z]
Can i get an encore do you want more [Linkin Park]
I've become so numb [Jay-z]
So for one last time i need ya'll to roar
One last time i need ya'll to roar. (Are you not entertained?)
(Are.you.not.entertained?)
(Is this not why you're here?)
Uh, Uh, Huh
Turn the music up
Turn me down
Guru... Lets go get 'em again
This time it's for the money my nigga
Brooklyn stand up [Verse One]
There's never been a nigga this good for this long
This hood
Or this pop, this hot
Or this strong
With so many different flows
This ones for this song
The next one I'll switch up
This one will get bit up
These fucks
Too lazy to make up shit
They crazy
They don't... paint pictures
They just trace me
You know what
Soon they forget where they plucked
They whole style from
And try to reverse the outcome
I'm like... tough
I'm not a biter
I'm a writer
For myself and others
I say a B.I.G. verse I'm only biggin up my brother
Biggin up my borough
I'm big enough to do it
I'm that thorough
Plus I know my own flow is foolish
So them rings and things you sing about
Bring em out
It's hard to yell when the bar-rel's in your mouth
I'm in... New sneakers
Deuce seaters
Few Diva's
What more can I tell you
Let me spell it for you
W-I-Double L-I-E
Nobody truer than H-O-V
And I'm back for more
New York's ambassador
Prime Minister back to finish my business up [Chorus: Singing]
What more can I say?
What more can I do?
I give this all to you
I know this much is true
My Life
(Look at my life)
(See what I see) [Verse Two]
You already know what I'm about
Flyin birds down south
Movin wet off the step
Purple Rain in the drought
Stuntin on hoes
Brushin off my shirt
But ain't nothin on my clothes
'Cept my chain
My name
Young H-O
Pitch the yay faithful
Even if they patrol I make payroll
Benz paid for
Friends they roll
Private jets down the Turks and Caicos
Cris' case loads
I don't give a shit
Nigga one life to live I can't let a day go
By
Without me being fly
Fresh to death
Head to toe until the day I rest
And I don't wear jerseys I'm thirty plus
Give me a crisp pair of jeans nigga button ups
S dots on my feet
Make my sight complete
What more can I say Guru play the beat, I'm livin' We gonna let this ride into the hook
I'mma snap my fingers on this one
What more can I say to you?
Get my grown man on
LET'S GO
(What more can I say?) [Verse Three]
Now you know ass is willie
When they got you in a mag
For like half a billi
And your ass ain't Lilly
White
That mean that shit you write must be illy
Either that or your flow is silly
It's both
I don't mean to boast
But damn if I don't brag
Them crackers gonna act like I ain't on they ass
The Martha Stewart
That's far from Jewish
Far from a Harvard student
Just had the balls to do it
And no I'm not through with it
In fact I'm just previewin it
This ain't the show I'm just EQ'in it
One, Two and I won't stop abusin it
To groupie girls stop false accusin it
Back to the music
The Maybach roof is translucent
Niggas got a problem Houston
What up B
They can't shut up me
Shut down I
Not even P.E.
I'mma ride
God forgive me for my brash delivery
But I remember vividly
What these streets did to me
So picture me
Lettin these clowns nit pick at me
and Paint me like a pickiny
I will literally
Kiss Tee-Tee in the forehead
Tell her please forgive me
Then squeeze into your forehead
I'm not the one to score points off
In fact
I got a joint to knock your points off
Young
Hova the God nigga blasphamy
I'm at the Trump International
Ask for me
I ain't never scared
I'm everywhere
You ain't never there
Nigga why would I ever care
Pound for pound I'm the best to ever come around here
Excluding nobody
Look what I embody
The soul of a hustler I really ran the street
A CEO's mind
That marketing plan was me
And no I ain't get shot up a whole bunch of times
Or make up shit in a whole bunch of lines
And I ain't animated, like say a, Busta Rhymes
But the real shit you get when you bust down my lines
Add that to the fact I went plat a bunch of times
Times that by my influence on pop culutre
I supposed to be number one on everybody list
We'll see what happens when I no longer exist
Fuck this man (What more can I say?) Whoo Uh Uh
The gift and the curse
Uh Uh yeah
First they love me then they hate me
Then they love me again
Love me again
Lets take a trip down
I got yall Lets take a trip down memory lane at the cemetery
Rain gray skies seems at the end of every young black live
It's this line damn him already
Such a goodkid got us poring Hen(nessy) already
Liquor to the curb for the niggas up above
When it cracks through to pavement that's my way of sending love
So give BIG a hug tell Aaliyah I said high
Till the next time I see her on the other side
He was just some thug that caught some slugs
And we loved him cause in him we saw some of us
He walked like us, talked like us
His back against the wall nigga fought like us
Damn poor Isyss that his momma name momma aint strong enough to raise no boy
What's his father name? shorty never knew him though he had his blood in em
Hot temper momma sad he act just like her husband
Daddy never fucked with em so the streets raised em
Isyss blaming herself she wish she could have saved him
Damn near impossible only men can raise men
He was his own man not even him could save him
He put his faith in the 38 in his waist
But when ya live by the gun you die by the same fate
End up dead before 38 and a
That's the life of what's raised by a winter, it's a cold world
Old girl turned to coke tried to smoke her pain away
Isyss life just ended on that rainy day
When she got the news her boy body could be viewed down at the city mourge
Open the drawer saw em nude
Her addiction grew
Prescription drugs dipped in brew
Angel dust dipped in whoo
She slipped into her own fantasy world
Had her self pregnant by different dude
But reality bites and this is her life
He wasn't really her husband though he called her wife
It was just this night when the moon was full and the stars was just right
And the dress was real tight
And it sounded like Lisa Lisa I wonder if I take you home
Will you still love me after this night
Mike was the hard head from around the way that she wanted all her life
Shit she wanted all the hype
Used to hold on tight when they wheelied on the bike
He was a Willie all her life
He wasn't really the one to like
It was a dude named Shi
Who would really treat her right
He wanted to run to the country to escape the city life
But Isyss liked this broad way life
She loved the Gucci sneakers the red, green and, white
Hanging out the window when she first seen em fight
So turned on that she had to shower twice
How ironic it would be some fight
That would turn it to a homicide that would alter their life
See Mike at 32 was still on the seen
He had a son 15 that he never saw twice
Sure he saw him as an infant but he disowned him
Like if that was my son he would look much different
See I'm light skinned and that baby there's dark
So it's momma's baby poppa's maybe
Mike was still crazy out there running the streets
had his old reliable 38 gun in his reach
He spent 14 years him and Isyss aint speak
He runnin around like life is a peach
Till one day he approached this thug
That had a mean mug
And he looked so familiar that he called um young Cuz
Told em get off the strip but the boy aint budge
Instead he pulled out a newer 38 snug
He clearly had to drop but the boy just paused
It was something in this mans face he knew he seen before
It's like looking in the mirror seeing his self more mature
He took it as a sign from the almighty lord
You know what they say about he who hesitates at war
(What's that) he who hesitates is lost
He cant explain what he saw before his picture went blank
The old man didn't think he just followed his instinct
Six shots into his kin out of the gun
Niggas be a father ya killing ya son
six shots into his kin out of the gun
Niggas be a father ya killing ya son
Meet the parents
(echo & fade out) It was all good just a week ago
niggas feel theyselves and then Watch The Throne drop
niggas kill themselves
What niggas gon do Hov?
This a new crack on a new stove
I'm in the two-door, true that
niggas tellin' me "You back"
Like a nigga ever left up out this bitch, huh?
and if life a bitch suck my dick huh?
and I bet she fucked the whole clique, huh
By the way nigga, you should fuckin' quit, nigga
Just forget it, you talk it, I live it
Like Eli I did it, jokes on you muthafucker and I get it
No paper hoe, but you can have some more of me
Or-gy, or are we speakin methaphorically
Historically, I'm kickin' bitches out like Pam, nigga
Goin' HAM nigga, me and Jigga
and a nigga still young, wanna have no kids
But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit
And a few white girls, asses flat a shit
But the head so good, damn a nigga glad he hit
Got em jumpin' out the building
Watch out below, a million out the door I'm about to go HAM
Hard As a Muthafucker,
Let these niggas know who I am
I'm about to go HAM
Hard As a Muthafucker, Let these niggas know who I am fuck y'all mad at me for?
You don't even know what I've been through
I play chicken with a Mack truck
Y'all muthafuckers woulda been moved
I swam waters with great whites
Y'all muthafuckers woulda been chewed
I hustle with vultures late nights
Y'all muthafuckers woulda been food
fuck wrong with these dudes
Try to walk around in these shoes
See the shit I saw growing up
And maybe you can take a peek at these boo's
niggas fantasize about the shit that I do daily like
These rappers rap about all the shit that I do really
I'm like really half a billi nigga
Really you got baby money
Keep it real with niggas
niggas ain't got my lady money
Watch the Throne don't step on our road
Bad enough we let you step on our globe
When my nephew died, daddy dead
niggas took the price on my uncles head
Nobody called the cops as my uncle bled
So I feel like I would like to know my uncles bread
Bow down, brother pay homage
don't spill hate all on my garments
Commes Des Garcon, fuck your fresh head shots nigga fuck your vests
fuck the pig, no pork on my fork
Peace God cause you know a nigga just went Ham Hard As a Muthafucker,
Let these niggas know who I am
Yeah I'm 'bout to go HAM
Hard As a Muthafucker,
Let these niggas know who I am
Yeah I'm 'bout to go HAM Uh huh yea yea

Some girls are nice

Hovie's home, Lukey baby I don't know what life will be in H.I.P. H.O.P
Without the boy H.O.V. (I will be, I will be)
Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior (Yeah)

When kingdom come, you ready? (I will be)
When kingdom come, I'm ready (I will be)

(Hey! Hey! Hey Hey Hey!!!) Now everywhere I go they like HOV you back
Up out the corner office out the cul-de-sac
Where's Iceberg Slim he was the coldest cat
Get your swag back daddy where your focus at
Got to admit a little bit I was sick of rap
But despite that the boy is back
And I'm so evolved I'm so involved
I'm showing growth, I'm so in charge
I'm C.E.O. and yeah going god
I'm so indebted, I should have been deaded
Selling blow in the park, this I know in my heart
Now I'm so enlightened I might glow in the dark
I been up in the office you might know him as Clark
But, just when you thought the whole world fell apart
I - take off the blazer loosen up the tie
Step inside the booth Superman is alive (I will be) The King Of New York (I will be) New York
Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior (Yeah)
So after this flow you might owe me a favor (Yeah)
When kingdom come, you ready? (I will be)

Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior (Yeah, yeah)

(Hey! Hey! Hey Hey Hey!!!) I hear "hurry up Hov" when I'm out in the public
Cause niggas like it, you love it; We be it, you're of it
You breathe it, we need it; bring it back to the hustlas
Had to dust off the Hammer dance, can't touch this
C'mon playboys, bring the cars back out
Cause ya boy Hov is back, you know them broads coming out
Got 'em dancing on the banquette, like they from Bankhead
Fuck Cristal, so they ask me what we drinking
I thought dudes remark was rude okay
So I moved on to Dom, Krug Rosé
And it's much bigger issues in the world, I know
But I first had to take care of the world I know
I'm from the bottom, so I still feel em from the bottom
Underdog before my cape, still couldn't stop him
Flash Gordon when recording, spark the light in the dark
Peter Park, Spiderman, all I do is climb the charts (I will be) The King Of New York (I will be) New York
Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior (Yeah)
So after this flow you might owe me a favor (Yeah)
When kingdom come, you ready? (I will be)
When kingdom come, uh huh (I will be)
Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior (Yeah, yeah)
So after this flow you might owe me a favor
(Hey! Hey! Hey Hey Hey!!!) Just when they thought it was all over
I put the whole world on my back and broad shoulders
The War-Hova, but who you know took over tracks like that
Guess what New York, New York - we back
And I ain't never been afraid of a drought
Since I was six, seventeen been getting money down South
Bout it, bout it, Master P
Ask the nigga Pimp C
Ask my homey Bun B
I run the streets the streets don't run we
Y'all run, we chill still waters run deep
I repeat, sing a long with me
I run the streets the streets don't run we
Ladies saying where you been Superman?
When niggas spending ten million in media on my hands
The Bruce Wayne of the game have no fear
When you need me just throw your ROC signs in the air, yeah! Its that Rocafella music....

Life's short, so i aimed
I ain't waiting for life to start portrayin' em
Its twice as hard to get a job that's paying
So i ain't payin' attention to what you saying
Rain-drops keep falling on my brain
Constant in the drop, all flames
I'm so hot even if the weather change
I don't have no top, i'm insane
Remember darkskinned Jermaine?
Swayed in the rain, im sorta kinda the same
Except i'm no lame and you gonna know my name
Before i go to work and feel my pain
Saying, i'm a bad guy, why's that?
Cause when my back's against the wall, nigga, i react
Secretly though, i know you admire that
You wish you had the balls to fire back--
Say hello, uh, uh, hello, uh. uh

Extraordinary figures

Before i sang, i had that thang on sippers
Can't complain bout what they ain't gon' give ya
That ain't gon' get you shit, mightaswell give up
Or get up, get out and get something, nigga
Get a job, my nigga, or get to dumping
Only God can judge him, only he without sin
Can tell me if my means can justify my ends
Til' then, i'm just gon' fly in the benz
Wire my friends through Western Union

So out come the mask and glove cause we ain't feelin' the love
We ain't doing crime for the sake of doing crime
We movin' dimes cause we ain't doin' fine
One out of three of us is locked up doing time
You know what that type of shit can do to a nigga mind?
My mind on my money, money on my mind
If you owe me ten dollars, you ain't giving me nine
Ya'll ain't give me 40 acres and a mule
So i got my Glock 40, now i'm cool
And if Al Sharpton is speaking for me
Somebody get him the word and tell him i don't approve
Tell him i'll remove the curses
If you tell me our schools gon' be perfect
When Jena 6 don't exist
Tell him THAT's when i'll stop saying bitch---BIIITCH! Say hello
To the bad guy

Where it began, I can't begin to know when But then I know it's growing strong Oh, wasn't the spring And spring became the summer
Who'd have believe you'd come along Hands, touching hands, reaching out Touching me, touching you Sweet Caroline
Good times never seem so good I've been inclined
to believe it never would... but now I... ...look at the night
And it don't seem so lonely
We fill it up with only two And when I hurt
Hurting runs off my shoulder
How can I hurt when holding you
One, touching one, reaching out
Touching me, touching you
Sweet Caroline
Good times never seem so good
I've been inclined to believe they never would
Sweet Caroline, good times never seem so good
Sweet Caroline, I believe they never could... LOVE ON THE ROCKS
Neil Diamond
Love on the rocks
Ain't no surprise
Pour me a drink
And I'll tell you some lies
Got nothin' to lose
So you just sing the blues
All the time
Gave you my heart
Gave you my soul
You left me alone here With nothing to hold
Yesterday's gone
Now all I want is a smile
First, they say they want you
How they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in a storm
When they know they have you Then they really have you Nothing you can do or say
You've got to leave,
Just get away
We all know the song You need what you need
You can say what you want Not much you can do
When the feeling is gone
May be blue skies above
But it's cold
When you love's on the rocks
First, they say they want you
How they really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in a storm
When they know they have you
Then they really have you
Nothing you can do or say
You've got to leave
Just get away
We all know the song
Love on the rocks
Ain't no big surprise
Pour me a drink
And I'll tell you my lies
Yesterday's gone
And now all I want is a smile Hello again, hello
Just called to say hello
I couldn't sleep at all tonight
And I know it's late
But I couldn't wait Hello, my friend, hello
Just called to let you know
I think about you ev'ry night
When I'm here alone
And you're there at home, hello Maybe it's been crazy
And maybe I'm to blame
But I put my heart above my head
We've been through it all
And you loved me just the same
And when you're not there
I just need to hear Hello, my friend, hello
It's good to need you so
It's good to love you like I do
And to feel this way
When I hear you say, hello Hello, my friend, hello
Just called to let you know
I think about you ev'ry night
And I know it's late
But I couldn't wait

And before you know, start to feeling good The story of my life
is very plain to read
it starts the day you came
it ends the day you leave
The story of my life
begins and ends with you
the names are still the same
the story's still the truth
I was alone
you found me waiting
and made me your own
i was afraid
that somehow i never could be
the man that you wanted of me
You're the story of my life
and every word is true
each chapter sings your name
each page begins with you
It's the story of our times
and never letting go
and if i die today
i wanted you to know
Stay with me
share with me
care with me
stay and be near
And when it began
i'd lie awake every night
just knowing somewhere deep inside
that our love affair just might write
The story of my life
it's so very plain to read
it starts the day you came
and it ends the day you leave Holly holy eyes

We're gonna ride
Till there ain't no more to go
Taking it slow
And Lord, don't you know
We'll have me a time with a poor man's lady Hitchin' on a twilight train
Ain't nothing here that I care to take along
Maybe a song
To sing when I want
No need to say please to no man
For a happy tune Oh, I love my Rosie child
You got the way to make me happy
You and me we go in style
Cracklin' Rose,
You're a store-bought woman
But you make me sing like a guitar hummin'
So hang on to me, girl,
Our song keeps runnin' on
Play it now, play it now
Play it now, my baby Cracklin' Rosie, make me a smile
Girl, if it lasts for an hour, that's all right
Cus We got all night to set the world right
Find us a dream that don't ask no questions
Yeah Oh, I love my Rosie child
You got the way to make me happy
You and me we go in style
Cracklin' Rose,
You're a store-bought woman
But you make me sing like a guitar hummin'
So hang on to me, girl
Our song keeps runnin' on
Play it now, play it now
Play it now, my baby Cracklin' Rosie, make me a smile
Girl, if it lasts for an hour, that's all right
We got all night
To set the world right
Find us a dream that don't ask no questions
Ba ba ba ba ba ... Stay for just a while
Stay and let me look at you
It's been so long, I hardly knew you
Standing in the door Stay with me a while
I only wanna sing for you
We've traveled halfway 'round the world
To find ourselves again September morn
We danced until the night became a brand new day
Two lovers playing scenes from some romantic play
September morning still can make me feel that way Look at what you've done
Why? You've become a grown-up girl
I still can hear you crying
In a corner of your room Look how far we've come
So far from where we used to be
But not so far that we've forgotten
How it was before September morn
We danced until the night became a brand new day
Two lovers playing scenes from some romantic play
September morning still can make me feel that way [Incomprehensible]
Me and you
I can still remember it all September morn
We danced until the night became a brand new day
Two lovers playing the scenes from some romantic play
September morning still can make me feel that way September morn
We danced, we danced that night away, yes
Two lovers playing the scenes from some romantic play
September morning still can make me feel that way
September morning still can make me feel that way
September morning still can make me feel that way Melinda was mine
'Til the time that I found her
Holdin' Jim
And lovin' him
Then Sue came along
Loved me strong, that's what I thought
Me and Sue
That died, too Don't know that I will
But until I can find me
A girl who'll stay
And won't play games behind me
Then I'll be what I am
A solitary man
Solitary man I've had it to here
Bein' where love's a small word
Part-time thing
Paper ring
I know it's been done
Havin' one girl who loves you
Right or wrong
Weak or strong Don't know that I will
But until I can find me
A girl who'll stay
And won't play games behind me
I'll be what I am
A solitary man
Solitary man Don't know that I will
But until I can find me
A girl who'll stay
And won't play games behind me
Then I'll be what I am
A solitary man
Solitary man
Solitary man
Solitary man Far
We've been traveling far
Without a home
But not without a star
Free
Only want to be free
We huddle close
Hang on to a dream On the boats and on the planes
They're coming to America
Never looking back again
They're coming to America Home, don't it seem so far away
Oh, we're traveling light today
In the eye of the storm
In the eye of the storm Home, to a new and a shiny place
Make our bed, and we'll say our grace
Freedom's light burning warm
Freedom's light burning warm Everywhere around the world
They're coming to America
Every time that flag's unfurled
They're coming to America Got a dream to take them there
They're coming to America
Got a dream they've come to share
They're coming to America They're coming to America
They're coming to America
They're coming to America
They're coming to America
Today, today, today, today, today My country 'tis of thee
Today
Sweet land of liberty
Today
Of thee I sing
Today
Of thee I sing
Today I've been up, I've been down
I've been so turned around
That I've seen my fate
In the eyes of others I've been high, I've been low
But there's one thing I know
There's a lot to give
When we give to each other So I bring you my song
Hoping you'll sing along Turn down the lights
Turn up the music
Let's just be together tonight
And turn down the lights First we're here, then we're gone
But the music plays on
From the heart of one
To the heart of another It's goodnight, not goodbye
We're just done for awhile
We'll be back again
With some new things discovered
And we'll bring you our song
Hoping you'll sing along Turn down the lights
Turn up the music
Let's just be together tonight
Come turn down the lights So I bring you my song
Hoping you'll sing along Turn down the lights
Turn up the music
Let's just be together tonight Turn up the love
Bring out the memories
You and I could share them all night
So turn down the lights
Turn down the lights
Turn down the lights
Turn down the lights Where it began,
I can't begin to knowin'
But then I know it's growing strong
Was in the spring
And spring became the summer
Who'd have believed you'd come along. Hands, touchin' hands
Reachin' out, touchin' me touchin' you Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined
To believe they never would
But now I, look at the night
And it don't seem so lonely
We fill it up with only two. And when I hurt,
Hurtin' runs off my shoulders
How can I hurt when I'm with you
Warm, touchin' warm
Reachin' out, touchin' me touchin' you
Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
I've been inclined,
To believe they never would
Oh, no, no Sweet Caroline
Good times never seemed so good
Sweet Caroline,
I believe they never could
Sweet Caroline... Did you ever read about a frog
Who dreamed of bein' a king
And then became one
Well, except for the names
And a few other changes
If you talk about me,
The story's the same one But I got an emptiness deep inside
And I've tried
But it won't let me go
And I'm not a man who likes to swear
But I never cared
For the sound of being alone "I am"... I said
To no one there
And no one heard at all
Not even the chair
"I am"... I cried
"I am"... said I
And I am lost and I can't
Even say why "I am"... I said
"I am"... I cried
"I am"
"I am"... I said
"I am"... I cried
"I am" Young child with dreams
Dream every dream on your own
When children play
Seems like you end up alone Papa says he'd love to be with you
If he had the time
So you turn to the only friend you can find
There in your mind Shilo when I was young
I used to call your name
When no one else would come
Shilo you always came
And we'd play Young girl with fire
Something said she understood
I wanted to fly
She made me feel like I could
Held my hand and I let her take me
Blind as a child
All I saw was the way that she made me smile
She made me smile Shilo when I was young
I used to call your name
When no one else would come
Shilo you always came
And you'd stay Had a dream and it filled me with wonder
She had other plans
Got to go and I know that you'll understand
I understand Shilo when I was young
I used to call your name
When no one else would come
Shilo you always came
Come today Shilo... Shilo... You don't bring me flowers
You don't sing me love songs
You hardly talk to me anymore
When you come through the door
At the end of the day I remember when
You couldn't wait to love me
Used to hate to leave me
Now after lovin' me late at night When it's good for you babe
And you're feeling alright
Well you just roll over
And you turn out the light
And you don't bring me flowers anymore It used to be so natural
To talk about forever
But 'used to be's' don't count anymore
They just lay on the floor
Till we sweep them away And baby, I remember
All the things you taught me
I learned how to laugh
And I learned how to cry Well I learned how to love
Even learned how to lie
So you'd think I could learn
How to tell you goodbye
'Cause you don't bring me flowers anymore Baby loves me, yes, yes she does
Ah, the girl's outta sight, yeah
Says she loves me, yes, yes she does
Mmm, gonna show me tonight, yeah Hey, she got the way to move me,
Cherry
(She got the way to groove me)
Cherry, baby
She got the way to move me
(She got the way to groove me)
All right Tell your mama, girl, I can't stay long
We got things we gotta catch up on
Mmm, you know
You know what I'm sayin'
Can't stand still while the music is playin'
All right Y'ain't got no right, no, no you don't
Ah, to be so exciting
Won't need bright lights, no, no we won't
Gonna make our own lightning Hey, she got the way to move me
Cherry
(She got the way to groove me)
Cherry, baby
She got the way to move me
(She got the way to groove me) No, we won't tell a soul where we gone to
Girl, we do whatever we want to
Ah, I love the way that you do me
Cherry, babe, you really get to me Hey, she got the way to move me,
Cherry
(She got the way to groove me)
Cherry, bab It wasn't nothing but a heartache
In the middle of a bad dream
Like I took on the whole world
And I never had a chance, girl
Was a one-way conversation
I never got the invitation
The sharpness of her words deceiving
And I couldn't stop the bleeding
And Lord, I tried to be forgiving
But getting by don't mean you're living
And on that highway going nowhere
Was an exit overdue
And all she had to give was heartache
So she broke my heart in two
Yes, she did
You found me drifting in a small boat
In the middle of an ocean
You were there on my horizon
And I didn't have a notion
Unprepared to comprehend it
Felt alone and unattended
Said my prayers and reached my hand out
And you appeared to me that day
Came and led me to a new shore
I had never been there before
Put me in the right direction
And you led me out of Hell
And if it wasn't for your good heart
I'd have never broke her spell
'cause you promised me tomorrow
And I learned that lesson well
Yes, I did. Yes, I did
You're the sum of all my heartbeats
You're the only truth my heart needs
Showed me how to make the journey
I can't let you walk away. No, not today
'cause I've already slept with heartache
Time to chase the night away
Just the two of us together
Does forever sound okay?
Say "Yes, it does." Say, "Yes, it does." Oh, yes it does. Dry your eyes, take your song out, it's a newborn afternoon
And if you can't recall the singer, you can still recall the tune
Dry your eyes and play it slowly, like you're marching off to war
Sing it like you know he'd want it, like we sang it once before And from the center of the circle to the midst of the waiting crowd
If it ever be forgotten, sing it long and sing it loud
And come dry your eyes And he taught us more about giving than we ever cared to know
But we came to find the secret and we never let it go
And it was more than being holy, oh it was less than being free
And if you can't recall the reason, can you hear the people sing? Right through the lightning and the thunder, to the dark side of the moon
To that distant falling angel that descended much too soon
And come dry your eyes Come dry your eyes Got a rock and roll ditty
From the heart of the city
To a country lane far away
Drums are beatin'
And the bass repeatin'
And it rocks you to sleep just the same

Sleep, safe and warm
Dream cares be gone
You know that it won't take long
We'll be singin' Elijah's Song
Singin' Elijah's Song

Ya' got a rock and roll daddy
And you make him so glad
He's got a smile 
A mile across his face
Movie star mom
Gonna keep you safe from harm
And she'll do it with style and grace

Sleep, safe and warm
Dream cares be gone
You know that it won't be long
We'll be singing Elijah's Song
Singin' Elijah's Song

Little bitty child when you laugh
I smile
It's a feelin' I won't ever forget
Far from now
When you're wanderin' 'round
There's a song that I left in your head

Dream, that's what you do
Dream, 'cause dreams come true
Someday when you're big and strong
You'll remember Elijah's Song
Remember Elijah's Song
Remember Elijah's Song
Remember Elijah's Song Kentucky woman, she shines with her own kind of light
Look at you once in a day, that's all wrong, looks alright
And I love her, God knows I love her Kentucky woman
She get to know you
She goin' to own you
Kentucky woman She ain't the kind, make heads turn at the drop of her name
But somethin' inside that she's got turns you on just the same
And she loves me, God knows she loves me Kentucky woman
She get to know you
She goin' to own you
Kentucky woman Don't want much, good Lord's earth beneath my feet
Gentle touch from that one girl and life is sweet and good
Ain't no doubt talkin' about Kentucky woman
She get to know you
She goin' to own you
Kentucky woman Don't want much, good Lord's earth beneath my feet
Gentle touch from that one girl and life is sweet and good
Ain't no doubt talkin' about Kentucky woman
She get to know you

Kentucky woman Kentucky woman
Kentucky woman My baby's Cryin' on a Saturday night
She thinks that nothin's ever gonna go right
But she'll make it
And we'll make it
There's not way that
I'm leavin' the best part of me There was a time I wanted out on my own
I even thought that I'd be ok alone
But oh, baby
I know, baby
That I'd be walkin'
Away from the best part of me Chorus:
You are the best part of me
The best that I am
Or ever will be
You baby, your the part
That allows me
To open my heart
And let love inside
I want you to know
What I've always
known
You are the best
Part of me Love isn't easy and
It's not always kind
Sometimes you only
Have to make
Up your mind
That you can make it
and you can make it
I know I made it
By keeping the best part of me My baby's cryin' 'cause she cant run away
And if she could it wouldn't last for a day
And she knows it
And I know it
It just shows that
She is the best part of me It's true baby, your the best part of me
The best that I am
Or ever will be
You baby, you're the part that allows me
To open my heart
And let love inside
I want you to know
What I've always known
You're the best part of me
Yes, you are the best part of me I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Love was out to get me, that's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love and I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried I thought love was more or less a giving thing
Seems the more I gave, the less I got
What's the use in trying, all you get is pain
When I needed sunshine, I got rain 
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love and I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried Love was out to get me, that's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love and I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind Songs of life they ring
from quiet steeples
to distant valleys,
Along the hillsides
of lovers' hearts,
of lovers' hearts. Come sing your songs of life
and they will keep you
from every wanting,
From ever needing,
forever more,
forever more. Oh, and when the moment's true,
It sings so softly to me and you;
You know it's true,
you know it's true. So sing my songs of life
that I will hold you
inside forever,
And you will know me,
and I'll be yours,
and you'll be mine. Oh, and when the moment's true,
It sings so softly to me and you;
You know it's true,
you know it's true. And I'll sing my songs of life
that I may hold you
inside forever,
And you will know me
and I'll be yours
and you'll be mine. Money talks
But it don't sing and dance
And it don't walk
And long as I can have you here with me
I'd much rather be
Forever in blue jeans
Honey's sweet
But it ain't nothin' next to baby's treat
And if you pardon me
I'd like to say
We'll do okay
Forever in blue jeans
Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight,
By the fire all alone, you and I
Nothing around
But the sound of my heart
And your sighs
Money talks
But it can't sing and dance
And it can't walk
And long as I can have you here with me
I'd much rather be
Forever in blue jeans, babe
Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight,
By the fire all alone, you and I
Nothing around
But the sound of my heart
And your sighs
Money talks
But it don't sing and dance
And it don't walk
And long as I can have you here with me
I'd much rather be
Forever in blue jeans
Honey's sweet
But it ain't nothin' next to baby's treat
And if you pardon me

There's a brand new baby born
And everyday
There's the sun to keep you warm
And it's alright
Yeah, it's alright I'm alive
And I don't care much for words of doom
If it's love you need,
Well I've got the room
It's a simple thing
That came to me when I found you
I'm alive
I'm alive Every night
On the streets of Hollywood
Pretty girls
Want to give you something good
Love for sale,
It's a lonely town at night
Therapy
For a heart misunderstood But look around,
There's a a flower on every street
Look around,
And, it's growing at your feet
And everyday you can hear me say
That I'm alive
I wanna take all that life has got to give
All I need is someone to share it with
I've got love
And love is all I really need to live
I'm alive
I'm alive And everyday
There's a brand new baby born
And everyway
There's enough to keep you warm
And it's okay
And I'm glad to say
That I'm alive And I don't care much for words of doom
If it's love you got, well I've got the room
It's a simple thing
That came to me when I found you
I'm alive
I'm alive
I wanna take all that life has got to give
All I need is someone to share it with
I've got love
And love is all I really need to live
I'm alive
I'm alive And I don't care much for words of doom
If it's love you need,
Well I've got the room
It's a simple thing that came to me And thank God I'm alive
I can take all that life has got to give
If I got someone to share it with
I got love and love is all you really need
I'm alive She was moring 
And I was night time 
I one day woke up 
To find her lying 
Beside my bed 
I softly said 
"Come take me" 
For I've been lonely 
In need of someone 
As though I'd done 
Someone wrong somewhere 
I don't know where 
Come lately 

You are the sun 
I am the moon 
You are the words 
I am the tune 
Play Me 

Song she sang to me 
Song she brang to me 
Words that rang in me 
Rhyme that sprang from me 
Warmed the night 
And what was right 
Became me 

You are the sun 
I am the moon 
You are the words 
I am the tune 
Play Me 

And so it was 
That I came to travel 
Upon a road 
That was thorned and narrow 
Another place 
Another grace 
Would save me 

You are the sun 
I am the moon 
You are the word 
I am the tune 
Play Me Wearin' my high boots,
Got all my worldlies here in a sack
Looking for something,
Knowing that it ain't here where I'm at
Ain't looking back
I'm comin',
Ride by thumbin',
Get by bummin'
I'm on my way Friend, have you seen Glory Road
Say, friend, I got a heavy load,
And I know Glory Road's waiting for me Caught me a pick-up
Down from Seattle through to L.A.
Seems like those folks
Go chasin' a new star every day
Ain't gonna stay
In Nevada, through Wyomin',
Colorado I'm on my way Friend, have you seen Glory Road
Say, friend, I got a heavy load,
And I know Glory Road's waiting for me Met so many others
Wanted to know which way to go
Louisiana, New York City
They wanted the answer
They'd ask of me.
Friend, have you seen Glory Road?
Say, friend, I got a heavy load
And I know Glory Road's waiting for me
Rest my load,
Now I know Glory Road won't set me free Suzanne takes you down
To her place by the river
You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night forever And you know the girl's half crazy
And that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China And just when you want to tell her
That you have no love to give her
She gets you on her wavelength
And lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover And Jesus was a sailor
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching
From the lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain
Only drowning men could see him
He said "All men are sailors then
Until the sea shall free them" But he himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
And you think that you may trust him
For he's touched your perfect body
With his mind. Suzanne takes you down
To her place by the river
You can hear the boats that go by
You can spend the night forever And the sun pours down like honey
On our lady of the harbor
And she shows you where to look
Amid the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds her mirror Take you back to a cotton field
In the heart of Lousiana
Little boy about nine years old
Sings a song in the heat of the day
Mama cried when her little boy sang
She knew he could be someone special
Mama cried 'cause the way that it was
He would only be wasted away Then his mama would pray
And every night she would say
Help my boy began
Take the lord by the hand Let the little boy sing
Got a feeling that takes you home
Got a melody of his own
Let the little boy sing Let the little boy try
Let the little boy buy
He can take you along
On the wings of his song
Let the little boy fly Take you back to New Orleans
Where the music wakes up with the city
To the bars by the railroad cars
On the neon side of town
Sang a song on the city streets
And people began to listen
Southern boy, sing your southern song
Take it like no one around Nobody walked by
Without feelin' high
Never heard it before
They'd be calling for more Let the little boy sing
Got a melody of his own
Got a feeling that takes you home
Let the little boy sing
And let the little boy fly
Let the little boy try
He can take you along
On the wings of his song
Let the little boy fly Let him take you away (Ladies and gentlemen
Super? are proud to introduce
The little boy with a soul of a star) Let the little boy sing
Got a melody of his own
Got a feeling that takes you home
Let the little boy sing
Let the little boy try
Let the little boy buy
He can take you along
On the wings of his song
Let the little boy fly Diamond Neil

BE
Lost
On a painted sky
Where the clouds are hung
For the poet's eye
You may find him
If you may find him
There
On a distant shore
By the wings of dreams
Through an open door
You may know him
If you may Be
As a page that aches for a word
Which speaks on a theme that is timeless
While the Sun God will make for your day
Sing
As a song in search of a voice that is silent
And the one God will make for your way And we dance
To a whispered voice
Overheard by the soul
Undertook by the heart
And you may know it
If you may know it While the sand
Would become the stone
Which begat the spark
Turned to living bone
Holy, holy
Sanctus, sanctus Be
As a page that aches for a word
Which speaks on a theme that is timeless
While the Sun God will make for your day
Sing
As a song in search of a voice that is silent
And the one God will make for your way 
LONELY LOOKING SKY
Lonely looking sky
Lonely sky, lonely looking sky
And bein' lonely
Makes you wonder why
Makes you wonder why
Lonely looking sky
Lonely looking sky
Lonely looking sky
Lonely looking night
Lonely night, lonely looking night
And bein' lonely
Never made it right
Never made it right
Lonely looking night
Lonely looking night
Lonely looking night Sleep we sleep
For we may dream
While we may
Dream we dream
for we may wake
One more day
One more day Glory looking day
Glory day, glory looking day
And all it's glory
Told a simple way
Behold it if you may
Glory looking day

And every heart will know

Caught on the wind's lazy tide
Sweetly how it sings
Rally each heart at the sight
Of you silver wings Skybird, skybird Nightbird
Find your way
For none may know it

DEAR FATHER
Dear Farther
We dream
We dream
We dream
While we may
Who are we to need
We need
We need
While we wait
While we wait I've seen the light
And I've seen the flame
And I've been this way before
And I'm sure to be this way again
For I've been refused
And I've been regained
And I've seen your eyes before
And I'm sure to see your eyes again For I've been released
And I've been regained
And I've sung my song before
And I'm sure to sing my song again Some people got to laugh
Some people got to cry
Some people got to make it through
By never wondering why Some people got to sing
Some people got to sigh
Some people never see the light
Until the day they die But I've been released
And I've been regained
And I've been this way before
And I'm sure to be this way again One more time again
Just one more time Hot August night
And the leaves hanging down
And the grass on the ground smellin' sweet
Move up the road to the outside of town
And the sound of that good gospel beat
Sits a ragged tent
Where there ain't no trees
And that gospel group tellin' you and me
It's Love, Brother Love, say
Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show
Pack up the babies and grab the old ladies
And ev'ryone goes, 'cause everyone knows
Brother Love's show Room gets suddenly still
And when you'd almost bet
You could hear yourself sweat, he walks in
Eyes black as coal
And when he lifts his face
Ev'ry ear in the place is on him
Starting soft and slow
Like a small earthquake
And when he lets go,
Half the valley shakes It's Love, Brother Love, say
Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show
Pack up the babies and grab the old ladies
And ev'ryone goes, 'cause everyone knows
Brother Love's show Take my hand in yours,
Walk with me this day
In my heart I know, I will never stray
Halle, halle, halle, halle
Halle, halle, halle, halle
It's Love, Brother Love, say
Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show
Pack up the babies
And grab the old ladies and ev'ryone goes
I say, Love, Brother Love, say
Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show
Pack up the babies
And grab the old ladies and ev'ryone goes... I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah 
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you
To a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah Maybe I've been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
I've seen your flag on the marble arch,
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and its a broken hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah 
I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though
It all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hey Look at the way she's wavin' her sail,
It's a wonderous sight to see.
People hurry on down from every town
Have a look at the Robert E. Lee. Proud and strong and made to be free,
Can't go wrong on the Robert E. Lee.
Got the sun in my eyes and the wind in my face.
And it's good just to be alive.
Gonna set out tonight for New Orleans;
I won't sleep till I arrive. And if I'm lucky
I'll find a young lady under the stars,
And we'll dance the night away. Somebody wake me and say it's a dream
Leadin' me far from my home.
And haven't you noticed, despite what it seems.
You can't deny it's you and I alone. Maybe spend my life just workin' the land,
Maybe livin' from day to day. But I'm free tonight in New Orleans:
If I like it I just might stay! Proud and strong and made to be free,
Can't go wrong on the Robert E. Lee.
Got the sun in my eyes and the wind in my face.
And it's good just to be alive.
Gonna set out tonight for New Orleans;
I won't sleep till I arrive. We don't believe in breaking up
We do believe in making up
That's all we really have to know
To make it so, it's official Yesterday is here and gone
Tomorrow's where we both belong
Today's the day to make that change
And rearrange your initials Marry me now
Say that I do
Don't wait around
You know I'm gonna be true
I'll give you my life
It's all that I got
I love you, believe it or not Got so much celebrate
So why do we even hesitate
We've got the time, let's make the date
'Cause ain't life great, together Married's not an easy thing
But look at all the joy it brings
And you and me can't be afraid
'Cause each day's made to treasure Marry me now
Say that I do
Don't wait around
You know I'm gonna be true
I'll give you my life
It's all that I got
I love you, believe it or not Marry me now
Tell me I do
Don't wait around
You know I'm gonna be true
I'll give you my life
It's all that I got
I love you, believe it or not Marry me now
Tell me I do
Don't wait around
I'm gonna be true
I'll give you my life
It's all that I got
I love you Marry me now
Marry me now
Marry me now
Marry me now
Marry me now
Tell me I do
Don't wait around
Gonna be true
Give you my life
Ah baby I'll give it all to you In the wintertime keep your feet warm
Keep your clothes on and don't forget me
Keep the memories
But keep your powder dry too In the summer by the pool side
While the fireflies are all around me
I'll miss you when I'm lonely
I'll miss the alimony too Don't forget me, please don't forget me
Make it easy on me just for a little while
You know I'll think about you
Let me know you think about me too Don't forget me, please don't forget me
Make it easy on me just for a little while
You know I'll think about you
Let me know you think about me too And when we're older it's hard to get around
Doesn't matter now, come on, get happy
'Cause nothing lasts forever
But I will always love you You know I'll think about you
Let me know you think about me too We'll there's no need explaining
It doesn't really matter anyway
So you let the rain in
And being sorry's not enough to say
And though you'll never make it right
I'm glad you're here with me tonight Hey babe, the sunshine's on you
Even though the skies are dark and gray
Well, if I have to miss you
I'd just as soon begin some other day
And though you'll never make it right
I'm glad you're here with me tonight Out there in the storm
Not everyone is safe and warm Now the leaves are falling
I guess they didn't have much more to say
And with the winter calling
It's gonna be a long and lonely day
And though you'll never make it right
I'm glad you're here with me tonight Cause out there in the storm
Not everyone is safe and warm
Oh, no And if we never make it right
I'm glad you're here with me tonight
If we never make it right
I'm glad you're here with me tonight
So glad to have you, babe (stay right here tonight)
So glad baby (oh, no)

Morningside
the old man died
and no one cried
they simply turned away
and when he died
he left a table made of nails and pride
and with his hands he carved these words inside
"for my children"
Morning light
morning bright
i spent the night
with dreams that make you weep
morning time
wash away the sadness from these eyes of mine
for i recall the words the old man signed
"for my children" And the legs were shaped with his hands
and the top made of oaken wood
and the children sat around this table
touched with their laughter
ah, and that was good
Morningside
an old man died
and no one cried
he surely died alone
and truth is sad
for not a child would claim the gift he had
the words he carved became his epitath
"for my children" Written by: neil diamond Mama told me that some day it would happen
But she never said it would happen like this
Papa said, "look out, some girl'll catch you nappin'
Some little girl will get to you with her kiss" You got to me
You brought me to my knees
Never thought I'd say please, girl
You got to my soul
You got control
You got to me, you got to be mine Used to slip thru every girl's hand like water
There never was one who could tie me down
Straight ahead and steady as gibraltar
'til you brought me tumblin' to the ground You got to me
You brought me to my knees
Never thought I'd say please, girl
You got to my soul
You got control
You got to me, you got to be mine [Originally by Gladys Knight And The Pips] L.A. proved too much for the man
(He couldn't make it)
So he's leavin' the life he's come to know
[He said he's goin']
He said he's goin' back to find
Ooh, what's left of his world
The world he left behind
Not so long ago He's leavin'
On that midnight train to Georgia
Said he's goin' back
To a simpler place in time And I'll be with him
On that midnight train to Georgia
I'd rather live in his world
Than live without him in mine He kept dreamin'
That someday he'd be a star
But he sure found out the hard way
That dreams don't always come true
So he pawned all his hopes
And he even sold his old car
Bought a one way ticket back
To the life he once knew
Oh yes he did
He said he would He's leavin'
On that midnight train to Georgia
Said he's goin' back to find
A simpler place in time And I'm gonna be with him
On that midnight train to Georgia
I'd rather live in his world
Than be without him in mine He's leavin'
On that midnight train to Georgia
Said he's goin' back to find
A simpler place in time And I've gotta be with him
On that midnight train to Georgia
I'd rather live in his world
Than be without him in mine Go, gonna board, gonna board
The midnight train to Georgia
Gonna board the midnight train
Gotta go, gonna board
Gonna board
Gonna board the midnight train Dear Father

It's no good unless you do
'Cause I need to hear you love me
Baby, just like you
Yes, I need to hear forever
And if forever it never comes
Well at least I heard you say it
If only just for once
Just like you,
I need to be remembered
Just like you
I need to know you care
It takes to of us to be together
Just like one
When it's said and done
That's only fair
We could live for just the moment
But that moment it's gonna pass
Can't you see it's now or never
But if we need to be together
It's time for you and me to say forever
For how's it gonna last
Yes, I need to hear you love me
Baby, just like you Love is all about chemistry
Isn't something you go off to school to learn.
Isn't math or ancient history,
It's the kinda thing that comes down to simple terms. It's not about you.
It's not about me.
Love is all about we.
Yes it's all about we. Wanna take you to that great unknown,
Show you to a place you've never been,
Down a road where only lovers go,
But before we leave I wanna repeat again: It's not about you.
And it's not about me.
Love is all about we.
All about we. With a string you can tie a knot,
But you gotta have somethin' to tie it to.
Otherwise all you've got is a knot,
But when it ties me to you,
It's a whole other thing.
Cause love is all about we.
Love is all about we. Love is not about young or old,
Touches everybody in a special way.
It's a blanket when the nights are cold.
It can even keep you dry on a rainy day. And it's not about you.
It's not about me.
Love is all about we.
Yes it's all about we. With a string you can tie a knot,
But you gotta have somethin' to tie it to.
Otherwise all you've got is a knot,
But when it ties me to you,
It's a whole other thing.
Cause love is all about we.
Yes it's all about we. No, it's not about you.
It's not about me.
Love is all about we.
Yes it's all about we.
Say it's all about we. You and me
Say it's all about we.
You and me
And we and we and we and we and we Love is all about we. Stones would play inside her head,
and where she slept, they made her bed.
and she would ache for love and get
but stones.
la la la la la la la la la la home.
lordy child a good days comin',
and i'll be there to let the sun in,
and bein' lost is worth the comin' home.
la la la la la la la la la on stones.
you and me a time for planting,
you and me a harvest granting,
the every prayer ever prayed,
we're just two wild flowers that grow.
la la la la la la la la la on stones. She said, "It's time to teach you the art of love."
She said, "We're gonna reach to the heart of love
A place you never knew;
A place that lives somewhere inside of you." I know I'm on a journey I won't forget
I know I had it in me to give and yet I never could before
I had to, if I wanted to be yours. You made me see I'd have to be a brand new man
He lives in me, so here in me is where I began. You showed the kind of lesson I can't erase
You showed a way to get from that lonely place
To where love comes alive
And you'd be waiting there when I arrive. The truth was clear
Love's not a place you go to find
It lives in here
Just leave it space, give it time I learned that I could stumble and maybe fall
I learned in being humble I'd have it all
A brand new way to live
That love's not what you have but what you give
And the art of love is who you share it with. Make of our hands, one hand
And make of our hearts, one heart
Make of our vows, one last vow
Only death will part us now Make of our lives, one life
Day after day, one life
Now it begins, now we start
One hand, one heart
Even death won't part us now Make of our hands, one hand
Make of our hearts, one heart
Make of our vows, one last vow
Only death will part us now Now it begins, now we start
One hand, one heart
And even death won't part us now Red, red wine
Go to my head
Make me forget that I
Still need her so Red, red wine
It's up to you
All I can do, I've done
But memories won't go
No, memories won't go I'd have sworn
That with time
Thoughts of you
Would leave my head
I was wrong
And I find
Just one thing
Makes me forget Red, red wine
Stay close to me
Don't let me be alone
It's tearing apart
My blue, blue heart The night was clear and the moon was yellow
And the leaves came tumbling down I was standing on the corner
When I heard my bulldog bark
He was barking up at the two men
Who were gambling in the dark It was Stagger Lee and Billy
Two men who gambled late
Stagger Lee threw a seven
Billy swore, he threw an eight
Stagger Lee told "Billy,
I can't let you get away with that
Well, you've won all my money
And my brand new stetson hat" Stagger Lee ran home
Went and got him his 44
Said, "I'm going to the bar room
Just to pay that debt that I owe" Go Stagger Lee, Go Stagger Lee
Go Stagger Lee, Go Stagger Lee
Said, "I' m going to the bar room
Just to pay that debt that I owe" Stagger Lee went to the bar room
Boy, he stood across the bar room floor
Said, "now, nobody move"
And he pulled out his 44 "Stagger Lee", cried Billy
"Oh, please don't you take my life
I got me three little children
And a very sickly wife" Go Stagger Lee, Go Stagger Lee
Go Stagger Lee, Go Stagger Lee
"got me three little children
And a very, very sickly wife" Stagger Lee shot Billy
Boy, he shot that poor boy so bad
That the bullet came thru Billy
And went right thru the bartender's glass While I was standing on the corner
When I heard my bulldog bark
He was barking up at the two men
Who were gambling in the dark Go Stagger Lee, Go Stagger Lee
Go Stagger Lee, Go Stagger Lee
Well, he was barking up at the two men
Who were gambling in the dark Oh yes,
Say it now Morning has broken,
Like the first morning
Blackbird has spoken,
Like the first bird Praise for the singing,
Praise for the morning
Praise for them springing
Fresh from the world Sweet the rain's new fall,
Sunlit from heaven
Like the first dewfall,
On the first grass
Praise for the sweetness
Of the wet garden
Sprung in completeness
Where his feet pass Mine is the sunlight,
Mine is the morning
Born of the one light,
Eden saw play Praise with elation,
Praise every morning
God's re-creation
Of the new day Hey,
Lady, she got painted eyes 
Have a way of talking to you 
Cut your heart out for the prize 
While the bitch sings hallelujah  Lordy, 
Well I'm made of blood and bone 
Na na na na na na na na na na 
Surely, you know 
I bleed when I get stoned 
Na na na na na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na  Look at the way I made my bed 
Rocks and knots and I'm half crazy 
Get to dream 'bout bein' dead 
But I ain't been that lucky lately  Lordy, 
Well I'm made of blood and bone 
Na na na na na na na na na na 
Surely you know 
I bleed when I get stoned 
Na na na na na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na... Lordy, 
Well I'm made of blood and bone 
Na na na na na na na na na na 
Surely you know 
I bleed when I get stoned 
Na na na na na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na... In Ensenada
We were running
from the things that we knew best
We only took the good and left the rest
In Ensenada Out on the border
And we knew
it was the last chance we would have
So we took the chance
and tried for one more laugh
In Ensenada "Hold me"
She said, "Need Me"
She said, "Love me"
"And make it last until tomorrow" Darling
You need me
The world is moving much to fast
Let's slow down and make it last Like the first time
'Cause the first time
Never really left my mind
Came looking for the things we used to find
In Ensenada Come looking for the things we used to find
In Ensenada "Hold me"
She said, "Need Me"
She said, "Love me"
She said "Make it last until tomorrow" Darling
You need me
The world is moving much to fast
Let's slow down Come on and
She said, "Hold Me"
She said, "Need Me"
She said, "Love me"
"And make it last until tomorrow" Darling
Believe me
Love me
We'll make it last until tomorrow Darling
Believe me
She said, "Love me"
"Make it last until tomorrow"
Hold me and need me
She said, "Love me"
"Just make it last until tomorrow" When I'm feeling blue,
All I have to do
Is take a look at you
And then I'm not so blue
When you're close to me,
I can feel your heart beat
I can hear you breathing
In my ear
Wouldn't you agree
Baby you and me
Got a groovy kind of love
We got a groovy kind of love Anytime you want to
You can turn me on to
Anything you want to
Anytime at all
When I taste your lips,
Ooh I start to shiver
Can't control the quivering inside
Wouldn't you agree
Baby you and me
We got a groovy kind of love
We got a groovy kind of love I love you
I love you
I love you it's true
When I'm feeling blue,
All I have to do
Is take a look at you
And then I'm not so blue
When I'm in your arms,
Nothing seems to matter
If the whole world could shatter,
I don't care Wouldn't you agree
Baby you and me
We got a groovy kind of love
We got a groovy kind of love Porcupine pie, porcupine pie, porcupine pie
vanilla soup, a double scoop please
no, maybe i won't, maybe i won't, maybe i will
the tutti fruit with fruity blue cheese
Ah, but porcupine pie, porcupine pie, porcupine pie
don't let it get on your jeans
and though it sounds a little strange
well, you gotta eat it with gloves
or your hands will turn green
Ah, but porcupine pie, porcupine pie, porcupine pie
it weaves it's web from a drink
and i do believe i'm gonna get one
vanilla? for dessert chicken ripple ice cream Once there was a way
To get back home again
Once there was a way
To get back home
Sleep pretty darlin' do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles to greet you when you rise
Sleep pretty darlin' do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby You never gave me your pillow
You only gave me your invitation
And in the middle of the celebration
I pray now Hey boy, you got to carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you got to carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you got to carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time And in the end,
The love we take
Is equal to the love we make... In this cold world
No matter where I go
The crowds are all the same To them I'm just
A pebble in the sand
A face without a name Nobody gives a hang
For what I say or do
But you
And in the shelter of your arms
I find peace and comfort and care
For I am wanted there In this cold world
You struggle to survive
And sometimes you can fall You'd think someone
Would lend a helping hand
They'd sooner see you crawl But just when life itself
Seems more than I can bear
You're there
And in the shelter of your arms
I find strength and safety and then
I rise and start again Just give me one good reason
To go on living
To keep on trying
For what, I ask you for what
If not for you
And all your love
To see me through But just when life itself
Seems more than I can bear
You're there
And in the shelter of your arms
I find strength and safety and then
I rise and start again I came with a little bit of sorrow
Was maybe a bit to sad
But one day rolled into tomorrow
And you gave me the best you had
That's how we started together
And how together we're gonna stay You taught me a little about good times
I fought through a little bit of rain
You brought me a part of your sunshine
You took in the heart of my pain
It wasn't suppose to happen
But then it happened to come my way Every night, every day, every word that you say
Made it so
Every thought that I had, said I ought to be glad
Now I know You showed what a little bit of love can do
You opened my eyes and a light came through
Took me to a place that I never knew
Goodbye to a little bit of something blue You came and you found me wanting
And I'm saying I'm here in your debt
Some days were a little bit daunting
Some days I'd rather forget
You changed my life for the better
And I know I'd better be good to you Every night, every day, every word that you say
Made it so
Every thought that I had, said I ought to be glad
Now I know You showed what a little bit of love can do
You opened my eyes and a light came through
Took me to a place that I never knew
So long to a little bit of something blue It wasn't suppose to happen
But then you happened to come my way Every night, every day, every word that you say
Made it so
Every thought that I had, said I ought to be glad
Now I know You showed what a little bit of love can do
You opened my eyes and a light came through
Took me to a place that I never knew
Goodbye to my little bit of something blue
Farewell to my little bit of something blue One, Two, Three Four! Hey, it takes a lot of time
If you want it right
Takes a lot of time
And it takes believin'
You gotta see the signs
And you'll get it right I see the signs in your eyes
And I know that it's
You, baby, baby
Ooh, baby, baby now
You, baby, baby
Only a blind man would leave you behind
But not me It takes a lot of lovin' to make it good
Takes a lot of lovin', believe it, babe
I'm sayin' it again so it's understood Me,
I believe in the things I keep seein' in
You, baby, baby
Ooh, baby, baby now
You, baby, baby
Only a blind man would leave you behind
But not me Hey
It takes a lot of lovin' to make it good
Takes a lot of love and believin' babe
I'm sayin' it again so it's understood Me, I believe in the things
I keep seein' in
You, baby, baby
Ooh, baby, baby now
You, baby, baby
Ooh, baby, baby now Ooh, baby, baby
You, baby, baby, now
Ooh, baby, baby
You, baby, baby now
You, baby, baby now
You, baby, baby now... Turn Around,
Where do you think you're going
We've been through this door so many times
Just Turn Around,
We've got to keep it going like we did before
In better times Turn Around,
Look at me
Can't you see, I'll be there for you
If ever you should need me
You can run away,
But you can never hide There'll come a day
You gonna have to face yourself
You'll wait and say,
It wasn't worth goodbye
Turn Around,
Look at me
I'm the guy who loves you
And when you get tired of running around Turn Around,
Don't turn away, babe
Turn Around, I want you to stay You and me,
We still belong together
No one ever said we'd have an easy ride
When you love someone,
You got to talk it over
When you love someone,
You just don't let it die Turn Around,
Look at me
I just want to tell you
What you're looking for
You've already found Turn Around,
Don't turn away, babe
Turn Around, I want you to stay Turn Around,
Don't turn away, babe
Just Turn Around, I want you to stay Turn Around,
Don't turn away, babe
Just Turn Around, I want you to stay
Turn Around,
Don't turn away, babe Round like a circle in a spiral
Like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending on beginning
On an ever-spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain
Or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning
Running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping
Past the minutes on its face
And the world is like an apple
Whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find
In the windmills of your mind Like a tunnel that you follow
To a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern
Where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving
In a half-forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble
Someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping
Past the minutes on its face
And the world is like an apple
Whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find
In the windmills of your mind Keys that jingle in your pocket
Words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly?
Was it something that I said?
Lovers walk along a shore
And leave their footprints in the sand
Was the sound of distant drumming
Just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway
Or the fragment of a song
Half-remembered names and faces
But to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over
Were you suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning
To the color of her hair? Like a circle in a spiral
Like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning
On an ever-spinning reel
As the images unwind
Like the circles that you find
In the windmills of your mind Written by: neil diamond and bill labounty
You've gotta take your time now
if love is gonna take you by the hand
you need to take your time though
'cause love is not a thing you can command
There's gotta be a reason
gotta be a closeness
gotta have a feeling
only you can know
And when you find love hold on tight
don't ever waste another night
you're gonna make it thru in spite of your fears
can anybody hear me
is anybody out there
I listen to the river
and hear the river calling out a name
trying to forgive her
but nothing's gonna ever be the same
There's gotta be a reason
gotta be a closeness
gotta have a feeling
only you can know
And when you find love hold on tight
don't ever waste another night
you're gonna make it thru in spite of your fears
can anybody hear me
is anybody out there
Gotta be a reason
gotta feel a closeness
gotta have a feeling
only you can know it
And when you find love hold on tight
don't ever waste another night
you're gonna make it thru in spite of your fears
can anybody hear me
is anybody out there
Can anybody hear me
is anybody out there
Can anybody out there hear me [A instrumental melody of three songs:]

Lonely Looking Sky
Dear Father The road is long with many awaiting turns
That lead us to who knows where,
who knows where
But I'm strong,
strong enough to carry him
He ain't heavy, he's my brother So long we go
His welfare is my concern
No burden is he to bare, we'll get there For I know
he would not encumber me
He ain't heavy, he's my brother If Im laden at all,
I I am laden with sadness that
everyone's heart isn't filled with the gladness
I am alone for one and other It's so long long road
From which there is no return
while we're on the way to live why not share And the load doesn't weigh me down at all
He ain't heavy, he's my brother He's my brother
He ain't heavy
He's my brother
He's my brother
He ain't heavy
He's my brother Hey, my Louise,

 I had a dream
We were out on the middle
Just you & me lying out in the sun
I knew that somebody would soon come to get you
Was hoping that maybe I could be the one Baby ooo do I wanna be
Ooo do I wanna be yours
Knew that I want to be
Like I never knew it before
And now everywhere I go
I go having you on my mind
Now all I want to know is
Ooo do you want to be mine
Because ooo do I want to be yours
For sure ooo do I want to be yours I dream you were waiting somewhere on a station
And hoping that maybe the right train will come
I heard myself starting a conversation
And saying your waiting was finally done Told you ooo do I wanna be
Ooo do I wanna be yours
Knew that I want to be
Like I never knew it before
And now everywhere I go
I go having you on my mind
Now all I want to know is
Ooo do you want to be mine
Because ooo do I want to be yours
For sure ooo do I want to be yours I dream you were sitting up there at your window
And looking at me with a strange kind of smile
I knew that you take me where I've never been too
Was hoping you'd ask me to stay for a while Saying ooo do I wanna be
Ooo do I wanna be yours
Knew that I want to be
Like I never knew it before
And now everywhere I go
I go having you on my mind
Now all I want to know is
Ooo do you want to be mine
Because ooo do I want to be yours
For sure ooo do I want to be yours Off course ooo do I want to be yours Matter of fact, you're on the right track
My future looks bright and blue...
Didn't take long to see I was wrong
That I still got it strong for you I'll come running, yeah
If you want me to
I'll come running, yeah
'Cause I'm done in, yeah, without you I'd give my last shirt
To take back the words
That brought all that hurt upon her
Both made mistakes
Had some bad breaks
But we've got what it takes to go on I'll come running, yeah
If you want me to
I'll come running, yeah
'Cause I'm done in, yeah, without you I'll come running, yeah
If you want me to
I'll come running, yeah
'Cause I'm done in, yeah, without you Yes I will, 'deed I will.
If I may, if I might, if I can. Once upon a passing night dream
he beheld a mystic image bathed in blue reflection.
Then he stood and made his song,
closed his eyes to feel the thunder
echo like a wave around him;
love was in this strange house,
and he knew he did belong, yes he did belong.
Yes I will, 'deed I will. If I can. And cold it was within the marrow,
waiting like a wounded sparrow,
helpless and forgotten while the radio played on.
Sing your song you fool, you dreamer;
'cross the space that lies between us;
cast the stones of fortune,
for the journey has begun, yes it has begun. So you do, so you want to be giving.
Say it out loud if you need to be holy.
So you do, so you want to be loving;
say it out now if you need to be holier still. So it seems or so it may be,
I can't know for sure but lately seems I'm on a journey
to a place I've never been.
And baby if I had the answers I would lay them all before you;
plainly it's a circle, one that ends and then begins, and begins again.
Yes I will, 'deed I will. If I can I never did believe
That I would end up losing you this way
As far as I could see
The life we had was always gonna stay
And I tried to be
The Man You Need I'll never understand
What I expected out of loving you
The way we had it planned
There always could be
Room enough for two
To live and grow
How could I know
I wouldn't be The Man You Need And I wanna know why
Yeah, I wanna know how
Say I wanna know where
Everything went wrong
And I'm sorry, 'cause I love you You told me more than once
I never understood my way around
The way that things worked out
I'm still not really sure
Of where I'm bound
You knew me well
I should have seen
I couldn't be The Man You Need And I reach for the sky
I reach for the stars
And all of the time
I was reaching for you
And I'm sorry, 'cause I love you Say it now again
I'm holdin' on
I've only just begun
To learn the meaning of not having you
I thought for sure
That I would be the man
You need forever more That I would be the man
You need forever more
I want to be the man
You need forever more Sleigh Bells Ringing

Rising up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive
So many times it happens too fast
You change your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger Face to face, out in the heat
Hanging tough, staying hungry
They stack the odds 'til we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger Rising up straight to the top
Had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance, now I'm not going to stop
Just a man and his will to survive It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger We're not indestructible,
Baby better get that straight.
I think it's unbelieveable,
How you give into the hands of fate.
Some things are worth fighting for,
some feelings never die.
I'm not asking for another chance,
I just wanna know why. (chorus)
There's no easy way out,
There's no shortcut home.
There's no easy way out,
Giving in can't be wrong. I don't wanna miss the fight,
I don't wanna drag you down.
But I'm Feeling like a prisoner,
Like a stranger in a no-name town.
I See all the angry faces,
Afraid that could be you and me.
Talking about what might have been,
Thinking about what it used to be. (chorus)
There's no easy way out,
There's no shortcut home.
There's no easy way out,
Giving in can't be wrong. Baby Baby we can shed this skin,
We can know how we feel inside.
Instead of going down an endless road,
Not knowing if we're dead or alive.
Some things are worth fighting for,
some feelings never die.
I'm not asking for another chance,
I just wanna know why. (chorus)
There's no easy way out,
There's no shortcut home.
There's no easy way out,
givin in, givin in, can't be wrong. (repeat and fade) How can I convince you
What you see is real
Who am I to blame you
For doubting what you feel I was always reachin'
You were just a girl I knew
I took for granted
The friend I had in you
I was living for a dream Loving for a moment
Taking on the world
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes I can see forever
The search is over
You were with me all the while
Can we last forever
Will we fall apart At times it's so confusing
The questions of the heart
You followed me through changes
And patiently you'd wait
'Till I came to my senses through
Some miracle of fate I was living for a dream
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever
The search is over You were with me all the while
Now the miles stretch out behind me
Loves that I have lost
Broken hearts lie, victims of the game Then good luck, it finally struck
Like lighting from the blue
Every highway's leading me back to you
Now at last I hold you
Now all is said and done
The search has come full circle
Our destinies are one
So if you ever loved me
Show me that you give a damn
You'll know for certain
The man I really am
I was living for a dream
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world
That was just my style
Then I touched your hand
I could hear you whisper
The search is over
Love was right before my eyes Two worlds collide, rival nations
It's a primitive clash
Venting years of frustrations
Bravely we hope against all hope
There is so much at stake
Seems our freedom's up against the ropes
Does the crowd understand
Is it east versus west
Or man against man?
Can any nation stand alone?
In the burning heart just about to burst
There's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night rising like a spire In the burning heart the unmistakable fire
(In the burning heart)
In the warriors code there's no surrender
Though his body says stop
His spirit cries, never
Deep in our soul a quiet ember
Know it's you against you
It's the paradox that drives us on
It's a battle of wills In the heat of attack
It's the passion that kills
The victory is yours alone
In the burning heart just about to burst
There's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night rising like a spire
In the burning heart the unmistakable fire
In the burning heart just about to burst
There's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night rising like a spire
In the burning heart the unmistakable fire
In the burning heart just about to burst

In the burning heart There you stood, that'll teach her
To look so good and feel so right
Let me tell you about
The girl I met last night It's understood, I had to reach you
I let the wheel of fortune spin
I touched your hand before
The crowd started crashin' in Now I'm higher than a kite
I know I'm getting hooked on your love
Talkin' to myself, runnin' in the heat
Beggin' for your touch
In the middle of the street And I, I can't stop thinkin' about you, girl
I must be livin' in a fantasy world
I'm so high on you Smart and coy, a little crazy
The kind of face that starts a fight
Let me tell you about
The girl I had last night Piercin' eyes, like a raven
You seemed to share my secret sin
We were high before
The night started kickin' in Now I'm screamin' in the night
I know I'm getting hooked on your love
Talkin' to myself, runnin' in the heat
Beggin' for your touch
In the middle of the street And I, I can't stop thinkin' about you, girl
I must be livin' in a fantasy world
I've searched the whole world over
To find a heart so true
Such complete intoxication
I'm high on you There you stood, that'll teach her
To look so good and feel so right
Let me tell you about
The girl I met last night Now I'm higher than a kite
I know I'm getting hooked on your love
Talkin' to myself, runnin' in the heat
Beggin' for your touch
In the middle of the street And I, I can't stop thinkin' about you, girl
I must be livin' in a fantasy world
I've searched the whole world over
To find a heart so true
Such complete intoxication
I'm high on you
I'm high on you
I'm high on you There's a story in my eyes
Turn the pages of desire
Now it's time to trade those dreams
For the rush of passion's fire
I can feel you tremble when we touch
And I feel the hand of fate
Reaching out to both of us
I've been holding back the night
I've been searching for a clue from you
I'm gonna try with all my might
To make this story line come true
Can ya feel me tremble when we touch
Can you feel the hand of fate
Reaching out to both of us
This love affair can't wait I can't hold back, I'm on the edge
(I can't hold back)
Your voice explodes inside my head I can't hold back, I won't back down Girl it's too late to turn back now
Another shooting star goes by And in the night the silence speaks to you and I
And now the time has come at last Don't let the moment run too fast
I can feel you tremble when we touch And I feel the hand of fate
reaching out to both of us
There's a story in my eyes, turn the pages of desire
Now it's time to trade those dreams
For the rush of passion's fire
I can't hold back, I'm on the edge
(I can't hold back)
Your voice explodes inside my head
I can't hold back, I won't back down
Girl it's too late to turn back now
I can see you tremble when we touch
Oooh, And I feel the hand of fate reaching out to both of us
This love affair can't wait
I can't hold back, I can't hold back
I can't hold back, I can't hold back When you're alone you ask yourself
What are you searching for?
Deep in the night a dream is born
One that you can't ignore If you think you can find the passion
And you're ready to take a chance
If you really believe you can make it
Then the power is in your own hands It's the moment of truth you're giving it all
Standing alone, willing to fall
If you can do it get up and prove it
Get up and show them who you are It's the moment of truth it's all on the line
This is the place this is the time
Waited forever, it's now or it's never
Nothing can stop you now, oh Once in your life you make a choice
Ready to risk it all
Deep in your soul you hear a voice
Answering to the call Though you know that it won't be easy
It's a promise you make for love
For the people that keep believing
And the one that you're thinking of It's the moment of truth you're giving it all
Standing alone, willing to fall
If you can do it get up and prove it
Get up and show them who you are It's the moment of truth it's all on the line
This is the place this is the time
Waited forever, it's now or it's never
Nothing can stop you now It's the moment of truth you're giving it all
Standing alone, willing to fall
If you can do it get up and prove it
Nothing can stop you now It's the moment of truth you're giving it all
Standing alone, willing to fall
If you can do it get up and prove it
Get up and show them who you are It's the moment of truth it's all on the line
This is the place this is the time
Waited forever, it's now or it's never
Nothing can stop you now It's the moment of truth
Moment of truth I'll never know what brought me here
As if somebody led my hand
It seems I hardly had to steer
My course was planned And destiny, it guides us all
And by it's hand we rise and fall
But only for a moment
Time enough to catch our breath again And we're just another piece of the puzzle
Just another part of the plan
How one life touches the other
Is so hard to understand Still we walk this road together
We try and go as far as we can
And we have waited for this moment in time
Ever since the world began Taken in the times gone by
We wonder how it all began
We never know and still we try
To understand And even though the seasons change
The reasons shall remain the same
It's love that keeps us holding on
Till we can see the sun again And we're just another piece of the puzzle
Just another part of the plan
And we have waited for this moment in time
Ever since the world began And I stand alone a man of stone
Against the driving rain
And the night, it's got your number
And the wind, it cries your name And we search for clues, win or lose
In this we're all the same
The hope still burns eternal
We're the keeper of the flame And we're just another piece of the puzzle
Just another part of the plan
How one life touches the other
Is so hard to understand Still we walk this road together
We try and go as far as we can
And we have waited for this moment in time
Ever since the world began When you're alone you ask yourself
What are you searching for?
Deep in the night a dream is born
One that you can't ignore If you think you can find the passion
And you're ready to take a chance
If you really believe you can make it
Then the power is in your own hands It's the moment of truth you're giving it all
Standing alone, willing to fall
If you can do it get up and prove it
Get up and show them who you are It's the moment of truth it's all on the line
This is the place this is the time
Waited forever, it's now or it's never
Nothing can stop you now, oh Once in your life you make a choice
Ready to risk it all
Deep in your soul you hear a voice
Answering to the call Though you know that it won't be easy
It's a promise you make for love
For the people that keep believing
And the one that you're thinking of It's the moment of truth you're giving it all
Standing alone, willing to fall
If you can do it get up and prove it
Get up and show them who you are It's the moment of truth it's all on the line
This is the place this is the time
Waited forever, it's now or it's never
Nothing can stop you now It's the moment of truth you're giving it all
Standing alone, willing to fall
If you can do it get up and prove it
Nothing can stop you now It's the moment of truth you're giving it all
Standing alone, willing to fall
If you can do it get up and prove it
Get up and show them who you are It's the moment of truth it's all on the line
This is the place this is the time
Waited forever, it's now or it's never
Nothing can stop you now It's the moment of truth
Moment of truth Girl it always seems about September
That's the time, again I remember the lights
And all the fun of those summer nights
Young and innocent and livin' fast
Didn't know enough to know
That a summer love can't last
Can't last Then the snow, it fell without a warning
Left me standin' out in the cold
My heart shattered, thinking only of yesterday
Does me no good to reminisce
I can really only tell you this
If I had my way, I'd take yesterday Do you remember those
Summer nights all night
Dancin' in the light of love
(Dancin' in the light of love)
Summer nights so right
Couldn't last beyond September
Summer nights all night
Livin' for your love
Dreamin' only of
You and summer nights I remember playin' by the shoreline
Before the fall when we had it all at our fingertips
Buildin' castles in the driftin' sand
Raced the waves as they ran to the shore
But the tides were turned for ever more
And the things we planned
Were castles made of sand Do you remember those
Summer nights all night
Dancin' in the light of love
(Dancin' in the light of love)
Summer nights so right
Couldn't last beyond September
Summer nights all night
Livin' for your love
Dreamin' only of
You and summer nights Ooh, summer nights
Makin' love beneath the northern lights
Ooh, summer nights
Now I'm back on my own again
Ooh, summer nights
We were diamonds in the rough in the moonlight
Ooh summer nights
Now I'm out in the cold again
Back on my own again I remember those
Summer nights all night
Dancin' in the light of love
(Dancin' in the light of love)
Summer nights so right
Couldn't last beyond September Summer nights all night
Dancin' in the light of love
Summer nights so right
Couldn't last beyond September Summer nights all night
Dancin' in the light of love
(Dancin' in the light of love)
Summer nights so right
Couldn't last beyond September Summer nights all night
Dancin' in the light of love Every night, a fleeting glimpse of candlelight
Chases cross the atmosphere but you're not here
And I see the shape of moonlight on the cityscape
But now the skyline wears a shroud
I see your voice in every crowd Listening for your footsteps in every hallway
Watching for your headlights around the bend
I can see you standing in every doorway Out in the street, in every glance
I see your reflection, I fall in a trance
Can't you see what I've become?
It's making me crazy, I see you in everyone Day by day, I watch the moment slip away
And traces of reality come back to me
Then I see your face somewhere in a distant place
The fantasy has gone too far
I close my eyes and there you are I can see you standing in every doorway
I can feel your heartbeat, I hear your voice
And hiding in my shadow you're with me always Out in the street, in every glance
I see your reflection, I fall in a trance
You can't know what you have done
I see you in everyone, in everyone In the night I see your eyes
From every direction a different disguise
Can't you see what I've become?
It's making me crazy, I see you in everyone Out in the street, in every glance
I see your reflection, I fall in a trance
Can't you see what you have done
I see you in everyone, in everyone In the night I see your eyes
From every direction a different disguise
Can't you see what I've become?
It's making me crazy, I see you in everyone You can't know what you have done
It's making me crazy, I see you in everyone When the wind decides that it's time to ride
To spread a little hell through the heartland
It takes a good long toke then it blows the smoke
Through the desert night And the wings of fire keep climbin' higher
Flames cuttin' hard through the homeland
Takes a mighty strong will to strip the chill
From the desert night You're wakened from your dream by a siren's scream
Trapped by the walls that surround you
Then it's will to will and you wonder still
Can you struggle free? In a thousand ways, when you turn the phrase
The wind's like a love of a woman
It takes a mighty mean bitch, some fire witch
To set the night on fire And the Santa Ana wind's gonna have its way, tonight
Nothing you can do's gonna change her mind
And ain't it a lot like love the way desire takes you in
And stokes the fire like the Santa Ana wind Now the air is calm and the heart grows numb
The ashes burn low in the heartland
'Til again the wind starts closin' in
To set the night on fire And the Santa Ana wind's blowin' cross my heart, tonight
Nothing you can do's gonna change her mind
And woman, I want your love, I need that passion deep within
Like the ragin' fire needs the Santa Ana wind And the Santa Ana wind's gonna take your life tonight
Nothing you can do's gonna change her mind
And ain't it a lot like love, the way desire takes you in
Swept away with the Santa Ana wind How can i convince you what you see is real
who am i to blame you for doubting what you feel
i was always reachin', you were just a girl i knew
i took for granted the friend i have in you
I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
taking on the world, that was just my style
now i look into your eyes
i can see forever, the search is over
you were with me all the while
Can we last forever, will we fall apart
at times it's so confusing, these questions of the heart
you followed me through changes and patiently you'd wait
till i came to my senses through some miracle of fate
I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
taking on the world, that was just my style
now i look into your eyes
i can see forever, the search is over
you were with me all the while
Now the miles stretch out behind me
loves that i have lost
broken hearts lie victims of the game
then good luck it finally struck
like lightning from the blue
every highway leading me back to you
Now at last i hold you, now all is said and done
the search has come full circle
our destinies are one
so if you ever loved me
show me that you give a damn
you'll know for certain
the man i really am
I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
taking on the world, that was just my style
then i touched your hand, i could hear you whisper
the search is over, love was right before my eyes Have you ever walked alone at night
Like a man against the world?
No one takes your side
A boat against the tide.
When your faith is shaken
You start to break
And your heart can't find the words.
Tossed upon the sand I give you a man against the world.
All the people cheer till the end is near
And the hero takes a fall.
Then they'll drag you through the mud.
You're only flesh and blood.
Oh I've walked the path from dark to light
And have yet to come to terms.
Alone I take my stand
I'm only a man against the world.
But love!
Like a distant reminder
It tugs at my shoulder
It calls me home.
I shout!
Can a single voice carry?
Will I find santuary
Within your arms?
Someday when the answer's clearer
Someday when I even the score
You'll reach and you'll find me near you
Right beside you
Forevermore!
But for now I walk the night alone
Like a man against the world.
A brand new day will shine
Through the avalanche of time.
Now the road's grown long
But the spirit's gone
And the fire within still burns.
Alone I take my stand
I give you a man against the world. It's been so long babe since I played this telephone game
I guess eventually some things will never change
And it can't matter to me baby all those words you say
They only remind me of yesterday
Well I see right through your crystal eyes and I already know your brave disguise
But baby you want more then I can give
(Oh) Baby don't you know
Everyone you know (Yeah everyone you know)
Everywhere you go (Oh they're telling me)
You're always Talkin' 'Bout Love
Yeah you're always talking about love
Every night and day every word you say
You're always Talkin' 'Bout Love
And suddenly babe you try to fool me with a kiss
Babe that don't work like it worked before
Well I don't know what you see in me that's causing you all the misery
Baby I can't love you like I did before
(Oh) Baby don't you know
Everyone you know (Yeah everyone you know)
Everywhere you go (Oh they're telling me)
You're always Talkin' 'Bout Love
Yeah you're always talking about love
Every night and day every word you say
You're always Talkin' 'Bout Love Sweat rollin' down my hands and face
Big fan on the screen porch turnin'
Cat looking for a hidin' place
Sun sinkin' but the fire's still burnin' Music playing a few doors down
I'm drawn to the sound
It's just too hot to sleep
Too hot I walk restless to the street cafe
See that's shakin? in the tropic zone
A cold Corona and a twist of lime
Cools me down when I'm alone Movin' closer from across the room
I've seen her before and she looks so fine
Never wanted any woman more
I look at the door and she reads my mind Too hot to sleep
Too hot to sleep
Give up the fight
Throw back the sheets
Oh, shoot out the lights Too hot to sleep
Too hot to sleep
Come take me higher
Caught up in the heat
Of the moment's fire Still burnin' in the afterglow
Sun peekin' through mirrored glasses
A little groggy from the night before
Feelin' wired as the day advances Can't seem to keep my mind off you
It's just no use, it's blind desire
I wanna know that I can count on you
To throw a little gasoline on the fire Too hot to sleep
Too hot to sleep
Give up the fight
Throw back the sheets
Oh, shoot out the lights Too hot to sleep
Too hot to sleep
Come take me higher
Caught up in the heat
Of the moment's fire In the steam of the night
Oh I, tossed and I turned
Come share the heat
Of the night passin' by us Too hot to sleep
Too hot to sleep
Give up the fight
Throw back the sheets
Oh, shoot out the lights Too hot to sleep
Too hot to sleep
Come take me higher
Caught up in the heat
Of the moment's fire Too hot to sleep
Too hot to sleep
Come take me higher
Caught up in the heat
Of the moment's fire I've heard talk of blind devotion
Lovers through thick and thin
Lives touched with real emotion
Faithful till the bitter end Now I must admit that the story's attractive
I've lost in far too many affairs
I've seen all the pain that the morning can bring I need to prove to myself
This is more than a crush
Can you convince me
It's not just a physical rush Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love that's been keepin' me up all night
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love So many nights in blind confusion
I've walked the line of love
We reach out in disillusion
When one night isn't nearly enough Now I'd like to know that for once in my life
I'm sure of what tomorrow may bring
I've heard all your talk
Can I take it to heart Now look me straight in the eye
'Cause tonight is the night
We've got to ask each other
If the moment is right Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love that's been keepin' me up all night
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love I've tread those mean streets
Blind alleys where the currency of love changes hands
All touch, no feeling
Just another one night stand I need to know that there's someone who cares
Could you be the angel to answer my prayers
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love that's been keepin' me up all night
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love that's been keepin' me up all night
Is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love
Is this love Baby if you really love me
You had better understand
That the silver in your pocket
Ain't no measure of a man And though the fortunes of our fathers
We aspire to rise above
When you're born into a breed
You're signed in blood Im a poor man's son
Workin all night long
Got a bad guitar
And a simple song Youre a rich man's daughter
Look at what youve done
You went and fell in love
With a poor man's son Baby, you were born in splendor
To a house of wealth and fame
Your mother was a spender
And you grew up on a stage And girl you could've loved for money
Could've fooled around for fame
But you went and took a chance
On the real thing Though the fortunes of our fathers
We aspire to rise above
When you're born into a breed
You're signed in blood Im a poor man's son
Workin all night long
Got a bad guitar
And a simple song Youre a rich man's daughter, youre a rich man's daughter
Im a poor man's son, Im a poor man's son
Im a poor man's son, Im a poor man's son
Poor man's son, Im a poor man's son, Im a poor man's son Im a poor man's son
Im a poor man's son
Im a poor man's son
Im a poor man's son You're still young, still so sure
So determined you can find the cure
You've always been the driven one
Speak your mind, rebel son In your eyes, wildfires rage
You read between the lines on every page
Take your chances while you're young
Seek the truth, rebel son Shatter the silence
Fill the night with your righteous defiance
While you've still got the will to run Take your message to the street tonight, rebel son
There's a restless voice that's callin' you
Through the darkest night, fight the fight, rebel son
To yourself alone you must be true, rebel son Stand your ground, against the tide
The proof of history is on your side
Fight the cause for everyone
Dare to dream, rebel son Shatter the silence
Fill the night with your righteous defiance
While you've still got the will to run Take your message to the street tonight, rebel son
There's a restless voice that's callin' you
Through the darkest night, fight the fight, rebel son
To yourself alone you must be true, rebel son In the dark, thunder in your heart
Can't you hear the sound and fury in the night?
Feel the heat, rising from the street
Passion runs so deep to match the fire in your eyes Take your message to the street tonight, rebel son
There's a restless voice that's callin' you
Through the darkest night, fight the fight, rebel son
To yourself alone you must be true, rebel son Rebel son
Rebel son
Rebel son So strange when lovers change their mind
To realize the joy left foolishly behind
But I feel secure down in my soul And somehow I know
I know that love is on my side
Deep down I know
I know that love is on my side
And I'm gonna win, yeah Some nights I slip into the past
To better understand why two hearts never last
I just don't know why nights so tender turn so cold And somehow I know
I know that love is on my side
Deep down I know
I know that love is on my side
And I'm gonna win, yeah Walk on, through the night
It's all just a game she plays so well
In time, well I know The tide will be turnin' and she's gonna learn
Shine a light, shine it bright
And time will testify I know I know that love is on my side
Deep down I know
I know that love is on my side
And I'm gonna win, yeah
Somehow I know I know that love is on my side
Deep down I know
I know that love is on my side
And I'm gonna win, yeah Ooh yeah, I know that love is on my side
I know How can I tell you to put it all in words?
There is so much left to say
But the meaning slips away How can I show you to see it through my eyes?
Don't deny that part of you that's been dying for it too
How do I know if I give you too much?
Will I scare you away? How do I know when to leave you alone?
When to beg you to stay
I wanna know Just how much love does it take to get to you
I stand here ready to break
Tell me, tell me
How much love does it take? Moment to moment
I don't know where it stands
Will I end up like the rest?
Well, it's anybody's guess Can I persuade you
So softly in a touch?
If it's all a waste of time
Well, I'm only wasting mine How do I know if I give you too much?
Will I scare you away?
How do I know when to leave you alone?
When to beg you to stay?
I wanna know Just how much love does it take to get to you
I stand here ready to break
Tell me, tell me
How much love does it take? How do I know when to leave you alone?
When to beg you to stay?
I wanna know Just how much love does it take to get to you
I stand here ready to break
Tell me, tell me
How much love does it take? Two dreamers, what would it feel like to meet by light of day
So lonely, wouldn't it feel right to love this night away
Your name keeps echoing down this wishing well
Wild hearts on an endless flight, set free in our dreams tonight
Two souls drawn to the fire in desperate dreams
Two hearts lost to desire's desperate schemes
One girl lost in a reverie
Lost love found in a memory
Those nights live on forever
Two fools lost in a desperate dream
Torn pages, more than a memory, pieces of the past
One vision, your image keeps haunting me, a love too good to last
Your voice keeps echoing down this wishing well
Wild hearts on an endless flight, set free our dreams tonight
Two souls drawn to the fire in desperate dreams
Two hearts lost to desire's desperate schemes
One girl lost in a reverie
Lost love found in a memory
Those nights live on forever
Two fools lost in a desperate dream
One love divided burns brightly through the night
Two dreams united until the morning light
Two souls drawn to the fire in desperate dreams
Two hearts lost to desire's desperate schemes
One girl lost in a reverie
Lost love found in a memory
Those nights live on forever
Two fools lost in a desperate dream
Lost in a desperate dream
It was a desperate dream
Only a desperate dream Jim Peterik/Frankie Sullivan) 
Published by Easy Action Music - ASCAP/Rude Music, Inc. - BMI  It felt so easy in the morning sun 
When love was in season I was on the run 
I was lookin' for trouble and the thrill of the chase 
Love was lookin' at me eye to eye, face to face 
One touch should've told me, try and understand 
Love was always a long shot to a gambling man 
With a roll of the dice, girl I threw it away 
Now I'm thinkin' 'bout you day and night, night and day  Didn't Know It Was Love 
Didn't know it was fate 
Didn't know it was destiny callin' 
Tell me it's never too late 
Was I too blind to see 
When push came to shove 
You were all that I needed 
Didn't Know It Was Love  Wasn't blind to the magic, you think I'm so tough 
Turnin' my back on the thunder, just ain't good enough 
I keep trying to shake you, there just ain't no way 
I've thinkin' 'bout you day and night, night and day  Didn't Know It Was Love 
Didn't know it was fate 
Didn't know it was destiny callin' 
Tell me it's never too late 
Was I too blind to see 
When push came to shove 
You were all that I needed 
Didn't Know It Was Love  Those crazy nights on the borderline 
Did my best to cut myself free 
Stood alone, just a prisoner 
Never knew you were holdin' the key, no  I was lookin' for trouble and the thrill of the chase 
Love was lookin' at me eye to eye, face to face  Didn't Know It Was Love 
Didn't know it was fate 
Didn't know it was destiny callin' 
Tell me it's never too late 
Was I too blind to see 
When push came to shove 
You were all that I needed 
Didn't Know It Was Love 
Didn't Know It Was Love 
Didn't know it was fate Summer and smoke, diamonds and dust
Go where you will, do what you must
The promise was made, your word was enough.
We had dreams, visions & plans
Into the night, out of our hands
Letting our passion fulfill our demands I remember those songs on the radio
The Jasmine, the wind in your hair
Doesn't seem like so long ago
Broken promises, & a heart that recalls when the promise was all that we had Into the dusty, reckless we rode, secret desire talking & cold
Bittersweet madness the stories are told
I remember those songs on the radio,
the Jasmine, the wind in your hair
and how it hurts to remember those, broken promises
Is it written in stone that we wind up alone whoa ho ho,
broken promises, can your heart still recall, when the promise was all that we had (Guitar solo) broken promises. Can your heart still recall when the promise was all that we had.
broken promises, can your heart still recall when the promise was all that we had. In this room
With the light of the sun in my eyes
I am blind
Can't recall
Where I am or what I did last night
Though I try and I try Nothing can shake me from your love
It's true
No one can make me feel the things you do
Oh no, oh no In the street I can feel people stare, 
Stare me down
I'm lookin' back
Just to see if I lost you somewhere
But you're nowhere around Nothing can shake me from your love
It's true
No one can make me feel the things you do
Oh no, oh no Turnin' over the city, 
just searchin for you
Ravin like a, a mad man
Is there anybody left, 
in this whole damn town
To take pity on a sad man
Lord help me through this
Yeah, help me through this
I just can't make it this way
Please help me find her
Yes help me find her
Somewhere, somehow, someway In the night
With the moon and the stars high above
I can see
It's so strange
Though there's no rhyme or reason for love
Still it makes you its slave Nothing can shake me from your love
It's true
No one can make me feel the things you do
Oh no, oh no
Oh no, oh no
Oh no Jim Peterik)

Somewhere 
Hey girl. help me if you can 
I'm coming to you with my heart in my hand 
Give me love, I'm starved for affection 
When all I need is just a little direction 
Somewhere In America 
Somewhere 'cross the sea, oh yeah 
Somewhere In America 
She waits for me  I need a teacher who can use a pet 
Give me a lesson in etiquette 
If there is anyone who'd like to try 
Maybe she'd like to come and teach me tonight  Oh, Somewhere In America 
Somewhere 'cross the sea, oh yeah 
Somewhere In America 
She waits for me 
She waits for me  Same old story, Same old song and dance 
What good is the glory, if you can't find romance 
I know she is waiting (no, she's waiting) 
Oooh, somewhere in the heartland (yes, she's waiting) 
And if she's out there tonight 
I wish she would raise her hand, yeah  Oooh  Hey girl. help me if you can 
I'm coming to you with my heart in my hand 
Give me love, I'm starved for affection 
All I need is just a little direction, yeah  Somewhere In America (somewhere baby) 
Somewhere 'cross the sea, oh yeah 
Somewhere In America, America 
She waits for me 
Oooh, she waits for me  Somewhere In America 
Somewhere In America 
Somewhere In America 
Somewhere In America From a distance I can see
The picture looks so clear to me
It's a vantage point so few can hope to find
And patience held the key
Our love, our only guarantee
Our destiny to make it through the night Through the tears and through the pain
This house was built to stand the strain
Though harder times, I surely can't recall
And crazy as it seems
Though all we had were crazy dreams
Those hungry years I'll miss the most of all Now at last, we fall together
We've been through it all together
Ooh, I never stopped lovin' you
When the money was short and dreams were shattered
Faith in love was all that pulled us
Through, I never stopped lovin' you I've stumbled on the way
So many nights love went astray
At different times we each played separate fools
But love became our pride
When once we'd seen the other side
Every highway led me back to you Through the wind and through the rain
This house was built to stand the strain
Though harder times, I surely can't recall Now at last, we fall together
We've been through it all together
Ooh, I never stopped lovin' you
When the money was short and dreams were shattered
Faith in love was all that pulled us
Through, I never stopped lovin' you
From a distance I can see
The picture looks so clear to me
A vantage point that only love can find I know what she's doin'
I saw it comin from the start
I've watched her in motion
She's aimin right for my heart
Guess I should know better
But it's hard to refuse
She's got it down to the letter Youngblood,
Struttin' like a school girl
Cocksure, got no doubt on her mind
She always gets what she wants
She gonna get what she needs Oooh, Eyes like crazy diamonds
Shinin' like a cat in the dark
The way she's put together
Always seems to tear me apart
Sneakin up behind me
She pulls me deeper under the
spell of her. Youngblood,
Struttin' like a school girl
Cocksure, got no doubt on her mind
She always gets what she wants
She gonna get what she needs She, she's not yet a woman
But she's got the power,
If you allow her
Under your skin, she's tyin' her
love to your soul
Soon she'll be takin' control
She's just a Youngblood,
Struttin' like a school girl
Cocksure, got no doubt on her mind
She always gets what she wants
She gonna get what she needs With her youngblood, she wraps
it all around you
So tight, that I'm powerless to leave
I'm burning hot
Just get a shot of that
Youngblood, youngblood Fly above the hills and valleys
High above the streets and alleys
On a home bound flight I carry
Love enough for one My emotions overflowing
Anticipation growing
And the moment still not knowing
Seems to weigh a ton And those scenarios
They spin in my mind
They drift like the clouds
They sail through the night And when I see those runway lights
In the town that I was born
I say a silent prayer, you? ll still be there And as my plane is touching down
Will I still belong in the arms that held my life
Or have I stayed away to long? I see your face in midnight driftings
By my side I hear your heartbeat
Closer still I hold your memory
Precious in my mind In the life that I? ve been chasing
So much times been wasted
I know I could be tasting
The love I left behind And those scenarios
They spin in my mind
They drift like the clouds
They sail through the night And when I see those runway lights
In the town that I was born
I say a silent prayer, you? ll still be there And as my plane is touching down
Will I still belong in the arms that held my life
Or have I stayed away to long? And those scenarios
They spin in my mind And when I see those runway lights
In the town that I was born
I say a silent prayer, you? ll still be there And as my plane is touching down
Will I still belong in the arms that held my life
Or have I stayed away to long? And when I see those runway lights
In the town that I was born
I say a silent prayer, you? ll still be there I wander as my plane is touching down
Will I still belong or have I stayed away to long? All of you'll still be there
I wander as my plane is touching down
Will I still belong or have I stayed away to long? children of the night
Well we rifle through the night
Like riders on the run now, in the street
Holding back the blinding light
'Cause a thousand eyes can be so indiscreet
And we hide away, love the night away
And we run between the shadows and the light We're children of the night
Runnin' from the light
Children of the night, of the night In the day we pass like strangers
'Cause we fear the consequences of our love
And we realize the danger
Still we choose to take our chances on our love
And we hide away, love the night away
And we run between the shadows and the light Like children of the night
Runnin' from the light
Children of the night
Of the night, oh yeah There's a fine line, such a fine line, very fine line
Between the day and the nighttime
The wrong and the right time for makin' sweet love
Find a place to hide, any place to hide, hidin' in the darkness
Feels like the right time, for love in the night time
For makin' sweet love And we hide away, love the night away
And we run between the shadows and the light Like children of the night
Runnin' from the light
Children of the night
Runnin' from the light
Children of the night
Runnin' from the light
Children of the night
Runnin' from the light
Children of the light
We're children of the night
Children of the night
We're children of the night The word is out -- heads are talkin'
And just like a fire ragin' wild in the night,
The rumors hot, the room is rockin',
It's out of control, too vicious to fight
Two lovers split -- a heart is shattered
And out of revenge it steals through the night,
Making sure the lies are scattered
To every border of this town tonight The word's on the street, you call it truth,
I call it slander,
Times are tough, talk is cheap --
Soon they'll talk about you --
Slander The jury splits -- undecided,
They're searching for clues,
My live in their hands
The hour has come, they stand divided,
The future shall judge the good and the bad And now, there's talk on the street --
I call it slander,
I will fight this somehow
Revenge will be sweet
Slander -- like a knife in my heart --
Slander
Slander -- gonna keep us apart --
Slander
Slander ¨c there's talk on the street
Slander -- revenge will be sweet
Slander -- I'm ready to fight
Slander -- I will find it tonight
Slander -- like a knife in my heart --
Slander
Slander -- gonna keep us apart
Slander
Slander -- there's talk on the street --
Slander -- revenge will be sweet
Slander -- too vicious to fight
Slander -- wild in the night Ooh, rockin'
Oh yeah Cruisin' down the motorway
Got my girl by my side
We're both a little anxious
Ooo, we got love on our mind Waitin', anticipatin'
For the fireworks in the night
Well I swear we were doin' eighty
When we saw those motel lights And we were rockin' into the night
Rockin' into the night
Oh hoo, rockin'
Rockin' into the night
Rockin' into the night, yeah Back on the back streets
Taking love where I can
I found a sweet Madonna
Ooo, with a bible in her hand Waitin', anticipatin'
Well for someone to save her soul;
Well I ain't no new messiah
But I'm close enough for rock and roll And we were rockin' into the night
Rockin' into the night
Oh hoo, rockin'
Rockin' into the night
Rockin' into the night
And I'm slowin' down and she's pullin' in Waitin', anticipatin'
For the fireworks in the night
Well I swear we were doin' eighty
When we saw those motel lights And we were
Rockin', rockin' into the night
Rockin', rockin' into the night
Rockin', rockin' into the night I know your mind like the back of my hand
A race that I ran before
Are you so blind that you'd turn your back
On love and slam the door If you're searching for something more
You have a good time
But if you'd follow your heart
You're gonna find that I'm the one The one, the one that really matters
The one that really cares
The one, when your whole world is shattered
Snap your fingers and I'll be there There's someone new, he's your brand new toy
You could break that poor boy in two
If that's your style, I should have known from the start
This heart wants no part of you If you're still the same girl I knew
All in good time
You're gonna follow your heart
You're gonna find I'm still the one The one, the one that really matters
The one that really cares
The one, when your whole world is shattered
Snap your fingers and I'll be there I know your mind like the back of my hand
A race that I ran before
Are you so blind that you'd turn your back
On love and slam the door If you're searching for something more
Have a good time
But if you'd follow your heart
You're gonna find I'm still the one The one, the one that really matters
The one that really cares
The one, when your whole world is shattered
Snap your fingers and I'll be there The one, the one that really matters
The one that really cares
The one, when your whole world is shattered
Snap your fingers and I'll be there The one, the one that really matters
The one that really cares
The one, when your whole world is shattered
Snap your fingers and I'll be there The one, the one that really matters
The one that really cares
The one, when your whole world is shattered Somewhere in America one night
Out on the road I saw her face
Trying hard to blend in with the others
She looked so out of place Woo oh, her eyes
They caught me by surprise
They haunt my memory
Woo oh, she turned me around
Read my thoughts aloud
She moved me with a look
Then vanished in the crowd You know who you are
In the night you'll feel a shiver
As I touch you from afar
Shining like a star
From the world we'll keep a secret
You know who you are The towns all run together
As the days pour into nights and fade away
Staring at the schedule
To go back to the city and the day Woo oh, come to me
Listen to my voice
Follow what you fell
Woo oh, run to me
I'm searching for a clue
A number or a name
I'm reaching out to you You know who you are
In the night you'll feel a shiver
As I touch you from afar
Shining like a star
From the world we'll keep a secret
You know who you are Sometimes when my heart can't find a reason
And it's just another season passing by
Woo oh, sometimes, I can close my eyes and touch you
In a moment I can feel again the way it felt that night Somewhere in America one night
Out on the road I saw her face
Trying hard to blend in with the others
She looked so out of place Woo oh, come to me
Listen to my voice
Follow what you fell
Woo oh, run to me
I'm searching for a clue
A number or a name
I'm reaching out to you You know who you are
In the night you'll feel a shiver
As I touch you from afar
Shining like a star
From the world we'll keep a secret
You know who you are You know who you are
In the night you'll feel a shiver
As I touch you from afar
Shining like a star
From the world we'll keep a secret
You know who you are It's just another summer
You hear a different drummer
You're lookin' for a way to check out from this line
You wrestle with temptation
Your job is your frustration
'Cause there's a lifetime chance you've got to find Still you wonder if you've got the clout
To make it happen in this cold-hearted town
And you're feelin' like you're trapped
You wonder should you just stop tryin' Take the message from the man
Who's not afraid to come on strong
When there's magic in the music
It's the singer not the song
When it's comin' from the heart
All the people sing along
It's the man behind the music
It's the singer not the song Inside your heart is achin'
There's challenge for the takin'
So shoot it from the hip
Believe in what you say
You're callin' this your best fight
You're lookin' for the limelight
Reachin' for a star
To guide you on your way Still you wonder if you've got the clout
To make a difference in this cold-hearted town
And you're feelin' like you're lost
You wonder should you just stop tryin' Well give the glory to the man
Who's not afraid to come on strong
When there's magic in the music
It's the singer not the song
When it's comin' from the heart
All the people sing along
It's the man behind the music
It's the singer not the song They give the glory to the man
Who's not afraid to come on strong
When there's magic in the music
It's the singer not the song
When it's comin' from the heart
All the people sing along
It's the man behind the music
It's the singer not the song Girl, is there something in the night
That draws us together
Are these moments worth the fight? Why must we keep it to ourselves
The secret we hold inside
Let me take you in my arms
With the strength of a love that's denied And we've always believed in our heart
That the chances we've missed
Still exist in the world after dark Backstreet love affair
Running through the heart of the night
Backstreet love affair Girl, there's a tension I can taste
That speaks for the danger
Let the warnings go to waste Eyes that reflect a secret fire
That covers the fear inside
In a flash we're lost from sight
To explore the romance that we hide And the thrill of the chase plays a part
In the chances we take
We escape to the world after dark Backstreet love affair
Running through the heart of the night
Backstreet love affair
Meet me in the city tonight Backstreet love affair
Running through the heart of the night
Backstreet love affair Backstreet love affair
Running through the heart of the night
Backstreet love affair
Meet me in the city tonight

Backstreet love affair
Backstreet love affair
Meet me in the city tonight
Backstreet love affair
Backstreet love affair There's a place within my heart
Tucked away from all the pain
And deep within the secret side of me
Just the simple truth remains
Words don't come easy
Feelings I hide even from myself
I'm ready to share without hesitation
I've been saving this moment
For someone who's saving this moment too
Tell me it's you I'll give you everything that I got
Say you'll never turn and run
Cause each and every beat of my heart
Tells me you're the only one
I've cast aside, this foolish pride
I know I can keep you satisfied
I'll prove it tonight in so many ways
That's a promise from the heart In good faith In the roles that we have chosen
Behind the parts we sometimes play
Lies the passage to the real me
With no illusions in the way
Words don't come easy But I'll get the feeling across somehow
Let it be now... I'll give you everything that I got
Say you'll never turn and run
Cause each and every beat of my heart
Tells me you're the only one
I've cast aside, this foolish pride
I know I can keep you satisfied I'll prove it tonight in so many ways
That's a promise from the heart
In good faith Behind these eyes tonight
The truth comes shining
A fire that is rarely seen It burns for you
I've never needed anyone this way
never find the right words to say
Until today But I'll give you everything that I got
Say you'll never turn and run
Cause each and every beat of my heart
Tells me you're the only one
I've cast aside, this foolish pride
I know I can keep you satisfied
I'll prove it tonight in so many ways
That's a promise from the heart
In good faith You are the love without exception
You're in my book of answered prayers
No need to change your heart's direction
At every crossroad I'll be there Through endless nights and life's confusion
Just simply sound your heart's alarm
I guarantee you'll find compassion
Right here within these open arms
There will be nights some restless nights
When you're alone your thoughts start to wander
Wonderin' if it's right, you search the night
Baby you're home, why look any farther Keep it right here,
Keep it right here
Your sweet love
Keep it right here,
Keep it right here
Your sweet love You are the love that I can count on
The only one who truly cared
Deep in your eyes I found my fortune
I treasure every night we've shared
There will be nights some restless nights
When you're alone your thoughts start to wander
Wonderin' if it's right, you search the night
Baby you're home, why look any farther Keep it right here,

The damage has been done
Don't expect to part as friends
The battle's just begun
I waited at your beckon call
My world turned all around you
I shoulda known the day I found you
You'd be leaving me behind The whole town,
the whole town's talkin'
The whole town
The whole town,
the whole town's talkin'
The whole town They're starin as I pass em by
how can they be so cold?
They're whisperin' that I'm the guy
Well I don't need to be told
Remember all the days in love
how could you run to a stranger?
Well I knew I was in danger
When it happened overnight The whole town,
the whole town's talkin'
The whole town
The whole town,
the whole town's talkin'
The whole town ('til fade) When I would concentrate with all my might
I could imagine, I would imagine
That I was standing in the spotlight And if I close my eyes very tight
A crystal vision, a premonition
Would find me shining underneath those hot lights And I'd daydream in school with far away eyes
Living the words of the radio songs
Making my plans someday to take the stage
With a rock and roll band And I would play in the light of a thousand smiles
(And the sound would be heard for a thousand miles)
Spreading through the towns and fields of America, America And I would demonstrate, every night
My plan of action, the crowd reaction
I'd have 'em standing, in the front row With my air guitar and only my imagination
We'd rock the nation the main attraction
In the rock and roll show And I'd daydream in school with far away eyes
Living the words of the radio songs
Making my plans someday to take the stage
With a rock and roll band And I would play in the light of a thousand smiles
(And the sound would be heard for a thousand miles)
Spreading through the towns and fields of America, America And time goes by some grew weary
It's hard to keep that dream alive
Oh, alive But love and music, keeps me goin'
I know that somehow I'll survive
Ooh, I'll survive And I'd daydream in school with far away eyes
Living the words of the radio songs
Making my plans someday to take the stage
With a rock and roll band And I would play in the light of a thousand smiles
Spreading through the towns, spreading through the fields
Taking to the streets of America Spreading through the towns, spreading through the fields
Taking to the streets of America
Spreading through the towns, spreading through the fields
Taking to the streets of America I know your mind like the back of my hand
A race that I ran before
Are you so blind that you'd turn your back
On love and slam the door If you're searching for something more
You have a good time
But if you'd follow your heart
You're gonna find that I'm the one The one, the one that really matters
The one that really cares
The one, when your whole world is shattered
Snap your fingers and I'll be there There's someone new, he's your brand new toy
You could break that poor boy in two
If that's your style, I should have known from the start
This heart wants no part of you If you're still the same girl I knew
All in good time
You're gonna follow your heart
You're gonna find I'm still the one The one, the one that really matters
The one that really cares
The one, when your whole world is shattered
Snap your fingers and I'll be there I know your mind like the back of my hand
A race that I ran before
Are you so blind that you'd turn your back
On love and slam the door If you're searching for something more
Have a good time
But if you'd follow your heart
You're gonna find I'm still the one The one, the one that really matters
The one that really cares
The one, when your whole world is shattered
Snap your fingers and I'll be there The one, the one that really matters
The one that really cares
The one, when your whole world is shattered
Snap your fingers and I'll be there The one, the one that really matters
The one that really cares
The one, when your whole world is shattered
Snap your fingers and I'll be there The one, the one that really matters
The one that really cares
The one, when your whole world is shattered Gary Smith/Jim Peterik)

With the light of the sun in my eyes
I am blind
Can't recall
Where I am or what I did last night
Though I try and I try Nothing can shake me from your love
It's true
No one can make me feel the things you do
Oh no, oh no In the street I can feel people stare, 
Stare me down
I'm lookin' back
Just to see if I lost you somewhere
But you're nowhere around Nothing can shake me from your love
It's true
No one can make me feel the things you do
Oh no, oh no Turnin' over the city, 
just searchin for you
Ravin like a, a mad man
Is there anybody left, 
in this whole damn town
To take pity on a sad man
Lord help me through this
Yeah, help me through this
I just can't make it this way
Please help me find her
Yes help me find her
Somewhere, somehow, someway In the night
With the moon and the stars high above
I can see
It's so strange
Though there's no rhyme or reason for love
Still it makes you its slave Nothing can shake me from your love
It's true
No one can make me feel the things you do
Oh no, oh no
Oh no, oh no
Oh no When she walks in the room
Every eye in the place
Turns to follow her every move
She's arrived on the scene
In her diamonds and jeans World class, she's got nothing to prove
It takes a long time to know her
He gives it up a little at a time She's gettin' what she wants
She's a popular girl, settin' those hearts on fire
Everybody wants to be part of her world
She's a popular girl, such a popular girl She walks down the street
Knocks 'em dead on their feet
With a casual nonchalance
When she's breaking your heart
She's the state of the art With license to take what she wants
It takes a hard man to hold her
She likes to get a little out of line She's gettin' what she wants
She's a popular girl, settin' those hearts on fire
Everybody wants to be part of her world
She's a popular girl, such a popular girl She waits by the window
The world is her stage
Each smile is her mirror in
The passing parade, passing parade And in the end, all she'll be is your friend
Though passion's your lone desire
She's the one you can't touch You want her so much
You're burnin', your heart's on fire
It takes a hard man to hold her
The challenge is forever on my mind She's gettin' what she wants
She's a popular girl, settin' those hearts on fire
Everybody wants to be part of her world
She's a popular girl, such a popular girl Rising up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive
So many times it happens too fast
You change your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger Face to face, out in the heat
Hanging tough, staying hungry
They stack the odds 'til we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger Rising up straight to the top
Had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance, now I'm not going to stop
Just a man and his will to survive It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger two eyes that haunt me
when i turn out the light
two lips that taunt me
from the darkness each night
i try and hide my heart
to keep my distance in the dark
what makes me fall apart
and call out your name
just when i'm certain
that you're out of my mind
this feeling grips me
so hard to define
this yearning inside
just can't deny it my heart's been branded
i can't let you go
don't understand it
just can't tell you no
don't leave me stranded cause i just can't let you go it's such a fine line
i walk on the wire
your hearts a magnet pulling me to the fire
girls like you are hard to shake
like habits hard as hell to break
it might be my mistake
but i need you tonight
you must have something
to have held me so long
i'm not accustomed
to a feeling so strong don't tell me it's wrong
-just can't deny it my heart's been branded
i can't let you go
don't understand it
just can't tell you no
don't leave me stranded
cause i just can't let you go You dress so formal like you don't even know
Whatcha got underneath it
Your straight-laced morals are just for show
Cause I know thatcha need it
I got you in my sites
Ya know I'm gonna give ya my best shot tonight
* Cause I can see 20/20
You just can't disguise
Oooh, the fire in your eyes 20/20
There's no way to hide
From my sweet love tonight* So educated that you think you're above
My street wise emotion
So old fashioned when it comes to love
You talk of devotion
I don't wanna change your life
What I really want is your love for the night (* Repeat)  Oooh, you know I can see you
I'm seem' right through you
oh you know that I want you
I want you tonight (* Repeat and fade) Into the night, two of a kind
We rode the crest of the wave
Are we destined to leave love behind I'll pay the price, just tell me the cost
To save something here in our heart
Something dear that cannot be lost And I can't help but wonder out loud
If only we could go back to square one
If finally we could pinpoint where we lost touch
I stand alone, reaching out my hand to you Oceans between us, strangers upon the shore
Like islands we stand alone, oceans between us now We shut out the hurt, we cast love aside
Stubborn beyond the point of all reason
Stranded by pride Craving your touch, oh, under its spell
Knowing for certain that no one on earth
Could love you so well And I know that you're wondering now
If only we could go back to square one
If finally we could pinpoint, where we lost touch
I stand alone, reaching out my hand to you Oceans between us, strangers upon the shore
Like islands we stand alone, oceans between us now
Oceans surround us, stand and watch as they disappear
To challenge the rising tide or drown in a sea of tears
Oh yeah, drown in a sea of tears Oceans between us, strangers upon the shore
Like islands we stand alone, oceans between us now
Oceans surround us, stand and watch as they disappear
To challenge the rising tide or drown in a sea of tears
Drown in a sea of tears Under the gum, the game can get rough,
I'm feeling no pain, calling it's bluff, it's bluff,
Just crossing the finish line, been breaking all the rules,
Out of the ice, the pressure can get to you. Whatever it takes to stop the fire inside,
I'm ready to feel that breath tonight. Cause fire makes steel, you're as hot as you feel,
When you're running on faith, it's the power that takes you over,
When they're hard on your heels, yet fire makes steel,
The hunger inside keeps driving me on. Fire makes steel 
There's no way to take the easy way out, no,
It doesn't exist in a world full of doubt, of doubt,
A fumble I'm searching for, I say:"No pain, no gain",
You do it your way, I do it mine. Whatever it takes to stop the fire inside,
I'm ready to feel that breath tonight. Cause fire makes steel, you're as hot as you feel,
When you're running on faith, it's the power that takes you over,
When they're hard on your heels, yet fire makes steel,
The hunger inside keeps driving me on. Don't you know! Cause fire makes steel, you're as hot as you feel,
When you're running on faith, it's the power that takes you over,
When they're hard on your heels, yet fire makes steel,
The hunger inside keeps driving me on. Cause fire makes steel, you're as hot as you feel,
When you're running on faith, it's the power that takes you over,
When they're hard on your heels, yet fire makes steel,
When you're running on faith, it's the power that takes you over,
It's the power that takes you over, yeah! She comes to life from the cover of a Hollywood magazine
With a sense of confidence hard to fight
Oh, she waits to be discovered
Underneath the cover of a neon night She's a star
All of my friends they got a bet she hasn't seen seventeen
I've never been any good at playin' the game
Oh, I'd just love to give her what she needs
Besides fortune and fame She's a star
From the backstreets to the city
There you'll find her lookin' so pretty
First she buys you, then she sells ya
You know she wants you when she's telling you Take me to the music
Out into the night
Drag me through the fire
Do it to me right, oh She steps right out and grabs you like a cover girl photograph
She'll size you up then she hits you with those Hollywood tears
Oh, but I don't need no close-up
To tell me she got style beyond her years She's a star
From the backstreets to the city
You're gonna find her lookin' so pretty
First she buys you, then she sells ya
You know she wants you when she's telling you Take me to the music
Out into the night
Drag me through the fire
Do it to me right, oh yeah Take me to the music
Out into the night
Drag me through the fire
Do it, baby
Do it to me right Take me to the music
Out into the night
Drag me through the fire
Do it to me right, yeah Wherever I go, whenever I fade away
Wherever I am I know in your heart I'll stay
Whenever you fall no matter how far away
I'll always be there 'cause I can still feel your pain So just keep holding on
You don't have to be afraid
I know love can be as strong as everything they say
You'll never be alone
I'll always be home Through all of these years all of these words we said
So many needless tears spinning round in my head
There comes a time when all of the pieces fit
I know you and I we can be so sure of it So just keep holding on
You don't have to be afraid
I know love can be as strong as everything they say You'll never be alone
I'll always be home Teardrops falling from your eyes like raindrops
Pouring from the skies
Remember you used to have the love I needed
Back when we were young Lovin' always came so easy
Heaven shared our love
Magic, the first time that I held you
You fit like a glove You'd soothe me with a shrug of your heart
You could move me
It always seemed my love would find you
When you needed a friend
I would be the man who would understand you I'm not that man anymore
I'm not gonna throw my heart away
No, that's not me anymore
Baby, I've changed One look is all it took to tell me
Your love was made of lies
Madness to think that I believed your reasons
Your alibis The day girl when I turned to look the other way girl
I realized the game you were playin'
Was breakin' my heart
I could see it plainly, time has changed me And I'm not that man anymore
I'm not gonna throw my heart away
No, that's not me anymore
Baby, I've changed And I'm not gonna throw my heart away
No, that's not me anymore
Baby, I've changed Baby I don't understand it
Feels like only yesterday
And I guess I must have been a foolish man
Just to let you slip away And it find it how time
Can turn you round
Bringing us back to the start
Baby up until now
I made it somehow
But I was missing the most important part How can I live
With half on my heart
When you're all that I need to survive
Baby living without you
Is getting to hard
Cause you're the only reason I'm alive You were the one and only who showed me
The reason to live
And I was a fool to leave you lonely
Just waiting there for me And it find it how time
Can turn you round
Bringing us back to the start
I was searching for something
I needed to find
With you were right here beside me baby all of the time How can I live
With half on my heart
When you're all that I need to survive
Baby living without you
Is getting to hard
You're the only reason I'm alive Well look at my face
These tears in my eyes
Will fight you out heaven and hell
I will do anything
And pay any price
If I could just hold you and touch you again How can I live
With half on my heart
When you're all that I need to survive
Baby living without you
Is getting to hard
Cause you're the only reason I'm alive Half on my heart
Half on my heart, baby
Half on my heart, baby
Half on my heart, you're the only reason
Half on my heart, only reason
Baby
Half on my heart
Half on my heart
Half on my heart
Half on my heart You're a difficult man and I don't understand things you do
I've been around, read all the signs I see in you
You've been running, dare me to follow but I won't go
There's a place in you somewhere I knew all along, now everyone knows I don't know why you lie
It makes no difference to me
You're just wasting your time
You don't even know me I don't care that you care
(No and) I don't dare what you dare
I don't Just for a moment try to remember, all the lies
I always knew there's nowhere to hide, the look in your eyes
Now I hated to see you never cared about who you hurt
When it comes down to me there's no way in hell you'll treat me like dirt I don't know why you lie
It makes no difference to me
You're just wasting your time
You don't even know me I don't care that you care
(No and) I don't dare what you dare
I don't go where you go
(No and) I don't know
I don't even wanna know
I don't I don't care that you care
(And) I don't dare what you dare
(And) I don't go where you go
(No and) I don't know what you know
I don't Just opened your letter, read it at least a thousand times
I look through a teardrop and read between the lines
A suitcase of dreams with one left behind
I wonder out loud if love can survive through time and tide Then you send a message in the dark
And I feel the rythm of your heart
When all my illusions fall apart
There's only the rythm of your heart Here in the spotlight, I miss you from each and every stage
I open my heart and turn another page
Another day gone and still I'm alone
Seems like I'm just always just a song away from home Then you send a message in the dark
And I feel the rythm of your heart
When all my illusions fall apart
There's only the rythm of your heart Just opened your letter, read it at least a thousand times
I look through a teardrop and read between the lines
A suitcase of dreams with one left behind Then you send a message in the dark
And I feel the rythm of your heart
When all my illusions fall apart
There's only the rythm of your heart Love stands behind a stained glass wall
In the hands of time
Always waiting to watch you fall
It's the patient kind Just listen to your heart and hear
(Oh) It's very clear
Here is the place and time
Will you be mine We share the feelings they're forever
An inspiration in the making
The time is now, now or never
It's all about giving and taking You're waiting for a place in time
You'll never find (You'll never find)
Let the rythm of your heart run free
For you and me Give Me The Word
The word is love
It's a hungry word
That I never thought too much of
Give Me The Word
Give me the sign
Cause I'll be here waiting for you From a distance love calls out to you
Once in a lifetime and never too soon
All I know when is when you're touching me
You're all I want
You're all I need Give Me The Word
The word is love
It's a hungry word
That I never thought too much of
Give Me The Word
Give me the sign
Cause I'll be here waiting for you Give Me The Word
The word is free
I'll be here waiting for you
The Word
The word is love
I'll be there waiting for you I've run out of time to waste
Got a fever in my mind
One more chance to take
It's been a long and lonely time
There's no going back
Can't change the things I've done
I got no reason left to run
Forgiveness is hard to find
Gotta take it while you can
I've lost all my foolish pride
I'm just an ordinary man
And time waits for no one
And love will pass you by
Don't waste another moment wonderin' why
Give me one more chance to love
Just one
Give me one more chance to touch the skies above
We've run out of time to waste
Why don't you leave the past behind
Your road ain't a lonely place
Cause it's paved with hearts like mine
And time waits for no one
And love will pass you buy
Don't spend another moment asking why
Give me one more chance to love
Just one
Give me one more chance to touch the skies above
I need one more chance for love
Just one
Give me one more chance to touch the skies above
Why do you make it so hard
Livin' day by day
Just take a look at your life
What more can I say
Give me one more chance to love
Just one
Give me one more chance to touch the skies above
I need one more chance for love
Just one
Give me one more chance to touch the skies above
Give me one more chance to love
Just one
Give me one more chance to touch the skies above These are the days
The time weâ? ve been given
To do what we will, what we can. The streets of the city
They flow like a river
And those dreams, they can slip through your hands. How will I see if I cannot believe it
How in the world would I know.
How will I fly if I cannot conceive it
Still we all need to know. Weâ? re seconds away, from another tomorrow.
Seconds away, from another hello.
Seconds away, from a moment of sorrow.
Weâ? re seconds away. With every heartbeat
I can feel it
Something keeps driving me on. Must be the call of my own human spirit.
This thingâ? s an addiction,
And just keeps holdinâ? on. How will I see if I cannot believe it
How in the world would I know.
How will I fly if I cannot conceive it
Still we all need to know. Weâ? re seconds away, from another tomorrow.
Seconds away, from another hello.
Seconds away, from a moment of sorrow. (yeah)
Weâ? re seconds away. Some life is forever, some are out of time.
Some still chase their passions
Some leave them all behind. Everything keeps changing
It can all turn on a dime
In the blink of an eye. (Music interlude) Weâ? re seconds away, from another tomorrow.
Seconds away, from another hello.
Seconds away, from a moment of sorrow.
Weâ? re seconds away. Weâ? re seconds awayâ?¦
Seconds awayâ?¦
Seconds away, from a moment of sorrow.
Weâ? re seconds away. Don't let 'em tell you that it's up to you
There's a wall of silence you can never break through
You gotta jump down, turn around and face the facts
Don't you ever give in 'cause you'll never get back There's a power in this pounding heart that defies the doubting crowd
'Cause when they're dead and gone, we'll still be standing Nevertheless, Nevertheless, Woh Oh
The wave of tomorrow is anyone's guess
We're fighting the battle like all of the rest
Never surrender - Nevertheless
Never surrender - Nevertheless Baby all of their rules ain't our concern
Sometimes you gotta forget a little more then you learn
It's an upphill battle when the odds are long
You know they're counting you out but you're calling them wrong Come walk with me down this distant path
Were are hopes and dreams collide
It's an open road from where I'm standing Nevertheless, Nevertheless, Woh Oh
The wave of tomorrow is anyone's guess
We're fighting the battle like all of the rest
Never surrender - Nevertheless
Nevertheless, Nevertheless, Woh Oh
The wave of tomorrow is anyone's guess
We're fighting the battle like all of the rest
Never surrender - Nevertheless
Never surrender - Nevertheless You can feel it in the streets of America
From the white house to tobacco road
Can't you see that there's two Americas
Where the hell are we supposed to go There's a power in this pounding heart that defies the doubting crowd
'Cause when they're dead and gone, we'll still be standing Nevertheless, Nevertheless, Woh Oh
The wave of tomorrow is anyone's guess
We're fighting the battle like all of the rest
Never surrender - Nevertheless
Nevertheless, Nevertheless, Woh Oh
The wave of tomorrow is anyone's guess
We're fighting the battle like all of the rest
Never surrender - Nevertheless
Never surrender - Nevertheless I tried to resist you in the beginning
Your fire was too hot to fight
You looked into me, the flame shot through me
Victory is in sight tonight Love has got me, this I know
Love has got me, won't let go
Feel the fire in my soul
Love has got me, oh love has got me
Don't let go Baby be careful don't get me excited
I'm on a mighty short fuse
The least indication will get me ignited
There's just no way to refuse tonight (tonight) Love has got me, this I know
Love has got me, won't let go
Feel the fire in my soul
Love has got me, oh love has got me As sure as the stars are shining
I thought I would never fall in love
I gave my life to freedom
But looks like love has got me now I tried to resist you in the beginning
Your fire was too hot to fight
You looked into me, the flame shot through me
Victory is in sight tonight (tonight) Love has got me, this I know
Love has got me, won't let go
Feel the fire in my soul
Love has got me, love has got me
Love has got me, love has got me
Love has got me, love has got me
Love has got me, love has got me Heart and soul I come to you
Are we meeting here on cue
Just in time for a love affair?
Like a fool that walked through fire
Just to reach my heart's desire
Baby would you be waiting there?
Can we afford to wonder
If this could be the one?
Woh-oh -- lookin' for a love that's everlasting
Wonder if the feeling's strong enough
Tell me are we merely lovers passing
Or an everlasting love? On this first night we are one
Kindred spirits on the run
Takin' hold of our destiny
In this world of chances missed
Does forever still exist
This side of the fantasy? Can we afford to wonder
If this could be the one?
Oh I'm lookin' for a love that's everlasting
Wonder if the feeling's strong enough
Tell me, are we merely lovers passing
Or an everlasting love?
This could be an everlasting love. Can we afford to wonder
If this could be the one?
Woh-oh I'm lookin' for a love that's everlasting
I wonder if the feeling's strong enough
Tell me, are we merely lovers passing
Or an everlasting love?
Could this be an everlasting love?
Could this be an everlasting love?
Could this be an everlasting love? We will remember this first night forever
After all the songs fade away
And the stage fades to gray And we will remember this first night together
We'll recall the things that we said
All the foolish dreams in our head
On the night we met I'm searching your eyes, have I seen you somewhere
You're filling my thoughts with a strange intrigue
I rivet my glance to your every movement
I got a notion your love's in a whole different league Tell me your name
What's your persuasion
Your first impression
Of this whole occasion And this night shall be the first night
And first nights were made for love
I can taste the action in the air tonight
Hearts are poundin' as the sparks ignite And this night shall be remembered
Long after the music's gone
And we'll reminisce on the things we said
And we'll fall in love again In the air I can sense a strong attraction
Emotions run wild are we on the verge?
We got a hot-line to satisfaction
I got the answer if you got the urge My motor is hot
I'm feeling elation
You came in the night
With the right temptation And this night shall be the first night
And first nights were made for love
I can taste the action in the air tonight
Hearts are poundin' as the sparks ignite And this night shall be remembered
Long after the music's gone
And we'll reminisce on the things we said
And we'll fall in love again We will remember this first night forever
We'll recall the things that we said
All the foolish dreams in our head And this night shall be the first night
And first nights were made for love
I can taste the action in the air tonight
Hearts are poundin' as the sparks ignite And this night shall be remembered
Long after the music's gone
And we'll reminisce on the things we said
All the painted dreams running through our head
And we'll fall in love again On the first night Just like a breath of spring,
You came to me
And I'd tried to win you back
Since I've set you free [Chorus1]("will you break the rules?")
If I gotta
("will you play the fool?")
Every time** [Chorus]
*and I'll do whatever it takes
And whatever the stakes
I will play, no, gonna get you someday* Seems you don't realize,
What you've got till it's gone
And if you just close your eyes,
It won't be too long
Till the one you love,
Starts to leave you
Till she finds her way,
Out the door [Chorus]
Down on the boulevard
Searchin so hard just to find you
The movie stars in the sidewalk squares
Seem to stare and remind you [Chorus 1]
[Chorus] And I'll do whatever I can
Just to see you again
Night and day,
If that's what it takes
To see you again If that's what it takes.
To see you again¡­ (repeat and fade) Do you love me? Tell me if it's true
Does that look of love reflect the real you?
Why does passion disappear when we're apart
Are you secretly breaking my heart? What do you really think?
What do you really think of me?
What do you really think?
What do you really think 'bout me? We were dreamers, rebels in our youth
Did our fantasies, obscure the bitter truth
Why do you turn your head when those boys walk by?
Try looking me straight in the eye What do you really think?
What do you really think of me?
What do you really think?
What do you really think 'bout me?
About me, I gotta know Ooh, can I reach you, is it worth the climb?
Let me teach you what's the bottom line
Shall we try again some other place and time, in time? Must every passing day be so tough, girl
Are you secretly breaking us up, girl
I wanna know, I gotta know for sure, I wanna know Do you love me? Tell me if it's true
Does that look of love reflect your point of view?
Why does passion disappear when we're apart?
Are you secretly breaking my heart? What do you really think?
What do you really think of me?
What do you really think?
What do you really think about me? What do you really think?
What do you really think of me?
What do you really think?
What do you really think about me?
About me, I gotta know, about me

She was the smoke, he was the fire
They had the time of their lives together
Turning it up higher and higher Now people talk about the two of them
And just shake their heads
It's all just a cryin' shame
He's got a heart, she'll never tame He can't give it up
Never give his heart away
Can't give it up
Never gonna give it away Gets it in the night
Hides it from the light of day
Ooh yeah
He's too wild to tame He got hooked on the spotlight
Fortune and fame, one-night stands
Under the spell of the hot lights
He had it all in the palm of his hand Now, she's waitin' in the wings and feelin'
Alone in the crowd
Their love is just a distant fire
He's too wild and she's too proud He can't give it up
Never give his heart away
Ooh, can't give it up
Never gonna give it away Gets it in the night
Hides it from the light of day
Can't give it up
He's too wild to tame Growin' up he was tagged a rebel
He was the smoke, she was the fire
They had the time of their lives together
Turnin' it up higher and higher People talk about the two of them
And just shake their heads
It's all just a cryin' shame
He's got a heart, she'll never tame He can't give it up
He'll never give his heart away
Can't give it up
Never gonna give it away Gets it in the night
Hides it from the light of day
Can't give it up
He's too wild to tame When I would concentrate with all my might
I could imagine, I would imagine
That I was standing in the spotlight And if I close my eyes very tight
A crystal vision, a premonition
Would find me shining underneath those hot lights And I'd daydream in school with far away eyes
Living the words of the radio songs
Making my plans someday to take the stage
With a rock and roll band And I would play in the light of a thousand smiles
(And the sound would be heard for a thousand miles)
Spreading through the towns and fields of America, America And I would demonstrate, every night
My plan of action, the crowd reaction
I'd have 'em standing, in the front row With my air guitar and only my imagination
We'd rock the nation the main attraction
In the rock and roll show And I'd daydream in school with far away eyes
Living the words of the radio songs
Making my plans someday to take the stage
With a rock and roll band And I would play in the light of a thousand smiles
(And the sound would be heard for a thousand miles)
Spreading through the towns and fields of America, America And time goes by some grew weary
It's hard to keep that dream alive
Oh, alive But love and music, keeps me goin'
I know that somehow I'll survive
Ooh, I'll survive And I'd daydream in school with far away eyes
Living the words of the radio songs
Making my plans someday to take the stage
With a rock and roll band And I would play in the light of a thousand smiles
Spreading through the towns, spreading through the fields
Taking to the streets of America Spreading through the towns, spreading through the fields
Taking to the streets of America
Spreading through the towns, spreading through the fields
Taking to the streets of America I've been waitin', tired of waitin'
For your song. your love song
Time just drags by anticipatin'
So much good love has come and gone And every minute
We spend apart is just time on my hands
It's breakin' my heart
Won't you please, please
Let it be now
I can't wait forever, no
Let it be now
I need you today girl
Girl will you ever know
Let it be now I get hungry, so damn hungry
For your love, your sweet love
Are you teasing, me for a reason
Need to know, why so slow And every minute
We spend apart is just time on my hands
It's breakin' my heart
Won't you please, please
Let it be now
I can't wait forever no
Let it he now
I need you today And every minute
We spend apart is just time on my hands
It's breakin' my heart
Won't you please, please
Let it be now
I can't wait forever no
Let it be now
I need you today girl
Girl will you ever know
Let it be now My love won't wait
My love won't wait
My love won't wait
My love won't wait
My love won't Jackie was the focus of my fantasies
There was passion in the schoolyard
Upon the autumn leaves Cuttin' class was gettin' easy
Throwin' good sense down the drain
While your touch would always please me
It was love that eased the pain Believin' that good times forever last
And love is a thing of the past Jackie no, Jackie don't go
You're a hard act to follow
Jackie go slow, Jackie please
I'm down on my knees, let's do it again I was head over heels, I was hard in love
I put Jackie on a pedestal so high above Rock 'n roll became our savior
That alone was all it took
When it came to fool behavior
Me and Jackie, we wrote the book Believin' that good friends forever last
Now, love is a thing of the past Jackie no, Jackie don't go
You're a hard act to follow
Jackie go slow, Jackie please
I'm down on my knees, let's do it again Jackie stay, I'm livin' each day
In the streets of the city
Callin' your name, Jackie please
This is insane, let's do it again In the beginning, all the time we spent together
Never further than a heartbeat away
Did you try and tell me, Jackie, you were leavin'?
I couldn't see beyond yesterday Jackie, Jackie don't go, Jackie Jackie no, Jackie don't go
You're a hard act to follow
Jackie go slow, Jackie please
I'm down on my knees, let's do it again Jackie stay, I'm livin' each day
In the streets of the city
Callin' your name, Jackie please
This is insane, let's do it again Jackie no, Jackie don't go
You're a hard act to follow
Jackie go slow, Jackie please
I'm down on my knees, let's do it again Sometimes alone at night I lie and wonder --
Was breaking up the only thing to do
We live our separate lives like perfect strangers,
But in the end, we're really perfect fools --
Maybe in time we'll shake the memories,
Maybe in time forget the pain --
But baby tonight, this heart remembers *it doesn't have to be this way --
We don't need to live the lie anymore
I want you back, I'm holding on --
It doesn't have to be this way
Here we stand -- love's an open door,
It doesn't have to be this way* With breakin' up there comes this empty feelin'
The child within you, lost without a prayer
So you run a little wild searching for some meaning
Deep into the streets of your despair
What does it take to shake your memory --
What in the world could ease the pain
How can I make your heart surrender (* repeat)
(* repeat) You swore you'd never again let yourself be tempted
Too many times in the past when you've opened up your heart
You've had it broken in pieces by too many lies
Still it's hard to acknowledge the past when she flashes those eyes Over and over
The song skips
Just as the final refrain fades away
Like fools we are caught in the game Caught in the game
Caught in the game again
Caught in the game
Caught in the game I swore I'd never again catch myself believin'
Too many times I've been hurt, and it makes you hard inside
But when I saw you in the city tonight, was it just imagination?
Or did your eyes burn a little too bright? For purely conversation Over and over
Those lights flash down at the corner arcade
Swept away
Like fools we are caught in the game Caught in the game
Caught in the game again
Caught in the game
Caught in the game again Caught in the game
Caught in the game again
Caught in the game
Caught in the game Over and over
The song skips
Just as the final refrain fades away
Like fools we are caught in the game Caught in the game
Caught in the game
Caught in the game
Caught in the game Caught in the game
Caught in the game again
Caught in the game again
Caught in the game again Would you still love me, if just perhaps
The roof above our heads should suddenly collapse
Would you still take me, for what I am
If I had nothin' This heart's an engine, runnin' lean
I'm down to skin and bone and still I'm fightin' clean
Do you share this vision, this reckless dream
Like the day we met Yeah if we work together we can pull this train
Can't wait forever for the wind of change
Will you stand beside me like you did before
When the storm is at the window
And the wolf is at the door
(Door) These are the hungry years
Stand up and face your fears
Your faith can fight these tears
These are the hungry years
(Hungry) Sometimes I watch you when you sleep
So safely unaware we might be in to deep
I hide my feelings behind these shades
Like you don't see Yeah if we pull together we can make this climb
With a love as tough as these desperate times
Will you stand beside me like you did before
Now the storm is at the window
And the wolf is at the door
(Door) These are the hungry years
Stand up and face your fears
Your faith can fight these tears
These are the hungry years
(Hungry) Can you remember the feelings we had
Baby, the first time we touched
Is there a way to find it again
Girl is that askin' too much, too much Would you still love me, if just perhaps
The roof above our heads should suddenly collapse
Will you stand beside me like you did before
When the storm is at the window
And the wolf is at the door
(Door) These are the hungry years
Stand up and face your fears
Your faith can fight these tears
These are the hungry years
(Hungry) These are the hungry years
Stand up and face your fears
Your faith can fight these tears
These are the hungry years
(Hungry)
Hungry years
Hungry years Like a vision standin' there
Lips poutin' and a come-on stare
Come on, I thought I had your number
[Incomprehensible] spend the night
I was workin' up an appetite for love
Don't let me die of hunger Ain't ya got no heart
No compassion for your lover
When I get you on the floor
I find it's just another Hesitation dance
You got me in a stone-cold trance
Hesitation dance
Go out and find another fool
For your game of chance Shut the door, draw the blinds
Yeah baby, gonna draw the lines
Come on, I know your heart's on fire
How could anyone who plays the part
And tastes so sweet wanna hide her heart away
You're my main desire Ain't you got no heart
No compassion for your lover
When I get you on the floor
I find it's just another Hesitation dance
You got me in a stone-cold trance
Hesitation dance
Go out and find another fool
For your hesitation dance Hesitation dance
You got me in a stone-cold trance
Hesitation dance
Go out and find another fool
For your game of chance Hesitation dance
You got me in a stone-cold trance
Hesitation dance
Go out and find another fool
For your game of chance You got me in a stone-cold trance

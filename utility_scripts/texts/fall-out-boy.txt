Am I more than you bargained for yet?
I've been dying to tell you anything you want to hear
Cause that's just who I am this week
Lie in the grass, next to the mausoleum
I'm just a notch in your bedpost
But you're just a line in a song
(A notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song)
Drop a heart, break a name
We're always sleeping in, and sleeping for the wrong team
We're goin' down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're goin' down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it
We're goin' down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're goin' down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it
Is this more than you bargained for yet?
Oh, don't mind me, I'm watching you two from the closet
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
Isn't it messed up how I'm just dying to be him
I'm just a notch in your bedpost
But you're just a line in a song
(Notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song)
Drop a heart, break a name
We're always sleeping in, and sleeping for the wrong team
We're goin' down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're goin' down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it
Down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down (down, down)
Down, down (down, down)
We're goin' down, down (down, down)
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it
We're goin' down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're goin' down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it
I'm gonna make you bend and break
(It sent you to me without wait)
Say a prayer, but let the good times roll
In case God doesn't show
(Let the good times roll)
(Let the good times roll)
And I want these words to make things right
But it's the wrongs that make the words come to life
"Who does he think he is?"
If that's the worst you've got better put your fingers back to the keys
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories
Even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you only sweeter"
One night, yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories
Thanks for the memories
See, "He tastes like you only sweeter"
I'm looking forward to the future,
But my eyesight is going bad
And this crystal ball
It's always cloudy except for
(Except for)
When you look into the past
(Look into the past)
One night stand

In the form of crunching numbers

Collecting page six lovers
Get me out of my mind
Get you out of those clothes
I'm a liner away from
Getting you into the mood
Whoa!

She says she's no good with words but I'm worse
Barely stuttered out a joke of a romantic stuck to my tongue
Weighed down with words too over-dramatic
Tonight it's "It can't get much worse"
Vs. "No one should ever feel like..."
I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I'll write them
So you need them just to get by
Dance, dance
We're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance
And these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me
You always fold just before you're found out
Drink up it's last call,
Last resort
But only the first mistake and I...
I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I'll write them

Why don't you show me a little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress, love
Dance, dance
We're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance
And these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me
Why don't you show me a little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress (mattress, mattress)
I only want sympathy in the form of you crawling into bed with me

Do-do-do-do do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do do-do-do-do
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey-ya, hey, hey-ya
Remember me for centuries
Mummified my teenage dreams
No, it's nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong
The story's all off
Heavy metal broke my heart
Come on, come on and let me in
Bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is supposed to match
The darkness that you felt
I never meant for you to fix yourself
Do-do-do-do do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do do-do-do-do
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey-ya, hey, hey-ya
Remember me for centuries
And I can't stop 'til the whole world knows my name
Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me
As long as there's a light
My shadow's over you
Cause I-I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom
You're about to bloom
You look so pretty
But you're gone so soon
Do-do-do-do do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do do-do-do-do
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey-ya, hey, hey-ya
Remember me for centuries
We've been here forever
And here's the frozen proof
I could scream forever
We are the poisoned youth
Do-do-do-do do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do do-do-do-do

We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey-ya, hey (We'll go down in history) hey-ya
Remember me for centuries
They say we are what we are
But we don't have to be
I'm bad behavior but I do it in the best way
I'll be the watcher (watcher) of the eternal flame
I'll be the guard dog of all your fever dreams
Oooooooh
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass glass (glass) (glass)
Oooooooh
I'll try to picture me without you but I can't
'Cause we could be Immortals, Immortals
Just not for long, for long
And live with me forever now
Pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long
We could be Immooooooor... Immortals
Immooooooor... Immortals
...immooooooor... Immortals
Immooooooor... Immortals
(Im... Immortals)
Sometimes the only pay off for having any faith
Is when it's tested again and again everyday
I'm still comparing your past to my future
It might be your wound but they're my sutures
Oooooooh
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass glass (glass) (glass)
Oooooooh
I'll try to picture me without you but I can't
'Cause we could be Immortals, Immortals
Just not for long, for long
And live with me forever now
Pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long
We could be Immooooooor... Immortals
Immooooooor... Immortals
(Immortals)
And live with me forever now...
Pull the blackout curtains down...
We could be Immortals... Immortals
Just not for long, for long
We could be Immooooooor... Immortals
Immooooooor... Immortals
...immooooooor... Immortals
Immooooooor... Immortals
(Im... Immortals)
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, I keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us part
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me till I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head
The stench, the stench, of summer sex
And CK eternity, oh hell yes
Divide me down to the smallest I can be
Put your, put your v-v-v-venom in me
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, I keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us part
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me till I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head
The blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb
It's worth two lions, but here I am
And I slept in last night's clothes and tomorrow's dreams
But they're not quite what they seem
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, I keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us part
You'll find your way
And may death find you alive
Take me down the line
In Gem City we turn the tide
You'll find your way
And may death find you alive
Take me down the line
In Gem City we turn the tide
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me till I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, I keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us part
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, I keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us part
Ohh
Ohhh
Say my name and his in the same breath
I dare you to say they taste the same
Let the leaves fall off in the summer
And let December glow in flames
Erase myself and let go
Start it over again in Mexico
These friends, they don't love you
They just love the hotel suites, now
I don't care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery
I said I don't care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery
Ohh
Ohh
Oh take a chance let your body get a tolerance
I'm not a chance, put a heat wave in your pants
Pull a breath like another cigarette
Pawnshop heart trading up (trading up)
On the oracle in my chest,
Let the guitar scream like a fascist
Sweat it out, shut your mouth
Free love on the streets but
In the alley it ain't that cheap, now
I don't care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery
I said I don't care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery
Ohh
Ohhh
I said, I don't care just what you think
as long as it's about me
I said I don't care just what you think
As long as it's about me
I said I don't care (I don't care)
I said I don't care (I don't care)
I said I (I) don't (don't) care (care)
I (I) don't (don't) care (no I don't)
I don't care, (I said)
I don't care, (I said)
I (I) don't (don't) care (care)
I don't care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery
I said I don't care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery
I am an arms dealer fitting you with weapons in the form of words
And (don't really care which side wins)
As long as the room keeps singing that's just the business I'm in
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
I'm not a shoulder to cry on, but I digress
I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh so intricate,
oh so intricate
I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh so intricate,
oh so intricate
I wrote the gospel on giving up
(You look pretty sinking)
But the real bombshells have already sunk (prima-donnas of the gutter)
At night we're painting your trash gold, while you sleep
Crashing not like hips or cars but more like p-p-p-parties
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
Bandwagon's full, please catch another
I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh so intricate,
oh so intricate
I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh so intricate,
oh so intricate
All the boys who the dancefloor didn't love
And all the girls whose lips couldn't move fast enough
Sing, until your lungs give out
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
(Now You)
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
(Wear Out The Groove)
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
(Sing Out Loud)
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
(Oh, oh)
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh so intricate,
oh so intricate
I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh so intricate,
oh so intricate
I'm gonna make you bend and break
(It sent you to me without wings)
Say a prayer, but let the good times roll
In case God doesn't show
(Let the good times roll)
(Let the good times roll)
And I want these words to make things right
But it's the wrongs that make the words come to life
"Who does he think he is?"
If that's the worst you've got better put your fingers back to the keys
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories
Even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you only sweeter"
One night, yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories
Thanks for the memories
See, "He tastes like you only sweeter"
I'm looking forward to the future,
But my eyesight is going bad
And this crystal ball
It's always cloudy except for
(Except for)

(Look into the past)

Thanks for the memories
See, "He tastes like you only sweeter"

In the form of crunching numbers
In hotel rooms
Collecting page six lovers
Get me out of my mind
Get you out of those clothes
I'm a liner away from
Getting you into the mood
Whoa!
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories
Even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you only sweeter"
One night, yeah, and one more time

Thanks for the memories (For the memories)
Thanks for the memories (For the memories)
See, "He tastes like you only sweeter"
I thought of angels choking on their halos
Get them drunk on rose water
See how dirty I can get them pulling out their fragile teeth
And clip their tiny wings
Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name
It will be held against you
Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name
If Heaven's grief brings Hell's rain
Then I'd trade all my tomorrows
for Just One Yesterday
(I know I'm bad news)
For Just One Yesterday
(I saved it all for you)
I want to teach you a lesson
In the worst kind of way
Still, I'd trade all my tomorrows
for Just One Yesterday
(I know I'm bad news)
For Just One Yesterday
(I saved it all for you)
For Just One Yesterday
Letting people down is my thing, baby
Find yourself a new gig
This town ain't big enough for two of us
I don't have the right name
Or the right looks
But I have twice the heart
Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name
It will be held against you
Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name (name)
If Heaven's grief brings Hell's rain
Then I'd trade all my tomorrows
for Just One Yesterday
(I know I'm bad news)
For Just One Yesterday
(I saved it all for you)
I want to teach you a lesson
In the worst kind of way
Still, I'd trade all my tomorrows
for Just One Yesterday
(I know I'm bad news)
For Just One Yesterday
(I saved it all for you)
For Just One Yesterday
If I spilled my guts
The world would never look at you the same - way
And now I'm here to give you all my love
So I can watch your face as I take it all away, away, away
If Heaven's grief brings Hell's rain
Then I'd trade all my tomorrows
for Just One Yesterday
(I know I'm bad news)
For Just One Yesterday
(I saved it all for you)
I want to teach you a lesson
In the worst kind of way
Still, I'd trade all my tomorrows
for Just One Yesterday
(I know I'm bad news)
For Just One Yesterday
(I saved it all for you)
For Just One Yesterday

B-b-b-be careful making wishes in the dark,
dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark,
mark
And besides in the mean, mean time-ime
I'm just dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the de-details with the
devil
So now the world can never get me on my
level
I just gotta get you off the cage
I'm a young lover's rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite
My songs know what you did in the dark...
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire!
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire!
Oh woah oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
In the dark, dark
Oh woah oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
In the dark, dark
oh oh oh, oh oh oh (in the dark, dark)
Writers keep writing what they
write
Somewhere another pretty vein just
died(di-died)
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me(me)
A constellation of tears on your
lashes
Burn everything you love, then burn the
ashes
In the end everything collides
My childhood spat back out the monster that you see
My songs know what you did in the dark
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire!
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire!
Oh woah oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
In the dark, dark
Oh woah oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
In the dark, dark
My songs know what you did in the dark...
(My songs know what you did in the dark...)
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire!
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire!
Oh woah oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
In the dark, dark
Oh woah oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
In the dark, dark
Oh woah oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Put on your war paint!
You are a brick tied to me that's dragging me down
Strike a match and I'll burn you to the ground
We are the jack-o-lanterns in July
Setting fire to the sky
He-here comes this rising tide
So come on
Put on your war paint!
Cross walks and crossed hearts and hope-to-dies
Silver clouds with grey linings
So we can take the world back from the heart-attacked
One maniac at a time we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart
Hey, young blood!
Doesn't it feel like our time is running out?
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No, I think it looked a little better on me
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Bring home the boys and scrap, scrap metal the tanks
Get hitched and make a career out of robbing banks
Because the world is just a teller and we are wearing black masks
"You broke our spirit," says the note we pass
So, we can take the world back from the heart-attacked
One maniac at a time we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart
Hey, young blood!
Doesn't it feel like our time is running out?
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No, I think it looked a little better on me
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Put on your war paint!
The war is won
Before it's begun
Release the doves
Surrender love
The war is won
Before it's begun
Release the doves
Surrender love
The war is won
Before it's begun
Release the doves
Surrender love
The war is won
Before it's begun
Release the doves
Surrender love
(Wave the white flag!)
Hey, young blood!
Doesn't it feel like our time is running out?
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No, I think it looked a little better on me
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Hey, young blood!
Doesn't it feel like our time is running out?
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Put on your war paint!
Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights, almost left behind
Suitcase of memories time after
Sometimes you picture me I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear what you said
And then you say go slow, I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
After my pictures fade and darkness has turned to grey
Watching through windows you're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside, the drum beat's out of time
If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
You say go slow, I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I will be waiting!
Time after time
If you're lost you can look and you'll
Really, really, really, really find me time after time
Whoa, if you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
Say, if you're lost you can look and you
Really, really, really, really, really, really, find me
Hey, if you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
Say, time after time, how long, how long
Time after time, how long will I love
Time after time, how long, how long
Time after time, how long, how long
Time after time, I'll be loving you always
I'll be loving you always, I'll be loving you always
I'll be loving you always, I'll be loving you always
Am I more than you bargained for yet?
I've been dying to tell you anything you want to hear
Cause that's just who I am this week
Lie in the grass, next to the mausoleum
I'm just a notch in your bedpost
But you're just a line in a song
(A notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song)
Drop a heart, break a name
We're always sleeping in, and sleeping for the wrong team
We're goin' down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're goin' down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it
We're goin' down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're goin' down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it
Is this more than you bargained for yet?
Oh, don't mind me, I'm watching you two from the closet
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
Isn't it messed up how I'm just dying to be him
I'm just a notch in your bedpost
But you're just a line in a song
(Notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song)
Drop a heart, break a name
We're always sleeping in, and sleeping for the wrong team
We're goin' down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're goin' down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it
Down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down (down, down)
Down, down (down, down)
We're goin' down, down (down, down)
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it
We're goin' down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're goin' down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it
Stuck in the jetwash
Bad trip I couldn't get off
And maybe I bit off more than I could chew
And overhead of the aqua blue
Fall to your knees bring on the rapture
Blessed be the boys time can't capture
On film or between the sheets
I always fall from your window to the pitch black streets
And with the black banners raised as the crooked smiles fade
Former heroes who quit too late
Just wanna fill up the trophy case again
And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't all, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't all, kids aren't alright
I'm not passive but aggressive
Take note, it's not impressive
Empty your sadness
Like you're dumping your purse on my bedroom floor
We put your curse in reverse
And it's our time now if you wanna to be
Maul the world like a carnival bear set free
And your love is anemic and I can't believe
That you couldn't see it coming from me
And I still feel that rush in my veins
It twists my head just a bit to think
All the people in those old photographs I've seen are dead
And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't all, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't all, kids aren't alright
And sometimes I just wanna sit around and gaze at my shoes
And let your dirty sadness fill me up just like a balloon
And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't all, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't all, kids aren't alright
Don't panic, no, not yet.
I know I'm the one you want to forget.
Cue all the love to leave my heart
It's time for me to fall apart.
Now you're gone, but I'll be okay.
Your hot whiskey eyes have fanned the flame.
Maybe I'll burn a little brighter tonight
Let the fire breathe me back to life.
Baby you were my picket fence
I miss missing you, now and then.
Chlorine kissed, summer skin.
I miss missing you, now and then.
Sometimes before it gets better
The darkness gets bigger
The person that you'd take a bullet for is behind the trigger
Oh, we're fading fast
I miss missing you, now and then.
Making eyes at this husk, around my heart.
I see through you and we're sitting in the dark.
So give me your filth, make it rough.
Let me, let me, trash your love.
I will sing to you everyday, if it will take away the pain.
Oh and I heard you've got it, got it so bad.
Cause I am the best you'll ever have.
Baby you were my picket fence
I miss missing you, now and then.
Chlorine kissed, summer skin.
I miss missing you, now and then.
Sometimes before it gets better
The darkness gets bigger
The person that you'd take a bullet for, is behind the trigger
Oh, we're fading fast
I miss missing you, now and then.
(oh oh oh ohhhhhhh)
Now and then
Now and then
Now and then
You were my picket fence
I miss missing you, now and then.
I don't even have my own attention
You say "please don't ever change"
But you don't like me the way I am
The sign says don't tap the glass
But I read it in reverse, ssalg eht pat t'nod syas ngis ehT
The world tried to burn all the mercy out of me
But you know I wouldn't let it
It tried to teach me the hard way
I can't forget it
Driving down the coast again
The pills are kicking in
The pills are kicking in
She said I love you till I don't
I'm just playing house
No idea what I'm doing now
There are no atheists in foxholes
The pressure's getting to me
It's time to throw in the towel
'Cause I'm stuck in the sunshine riptide
Dancing all alone in the morning light
The sunshine riptide
You came in like a wave when I was feeling alright
The sunshine
Call me Oluwaburna
I fell in love but I didn't fall down
They say me nah normal
Drink Hennessy, me nah drink water
Make me stumble pon me Air Jordan
Ain't no slowing down, no I keep it rolling now
Smoking in my fucking ride
Passing it to my fucking guys
Feel like I'm bulletproof, bulletproof, baby
With the sun shining through
Got the blunt and the juice, cruise
Riding through the...
The sunshine riptide
Dancing all alone in the morning light
The sunshine riptide
You came in like a wave when I was feeling alright
Sun, sun, sun
Sun, sun, sun (I'm stuck in the sun)
Sun, sun, sun
Sun, sun, sun
You are my truest feeling yet
I love you so much
It's just like oxygen
And it's going to my head
A public meltdown
Petulant but irreverent
Take all your possibilities and take away the limits
Take your ideas and throw away all the gimmicks
I do the best with what I have
The pills are kicking in
The pills are kicking in
'Cause I'm stuck in the sunshine riptide
Dancing all alone in the morning light
The sunshine riptide
You came in like a wave when I was feeling-
I was stuck in the sunshine riptide
Dancing all alone in the morning light
The sunshine riptide
You came in like a wave when I was feeling al-
Sun, sun, sun
Sun, sun, sun (I'm stuck in the sun)
Sun, sun, sun
Sun, sun, sun
Baby, seasons change but people don't
And I'll always be waiting in the back of the room
I'm boring but overcompensate
With headlines and flash, flash, flash photography
But don't pretend you ever forgot about me
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me.
Wouldn't you rather be a widow than a divorcee
Style your wake for fashion magazines
Widow or a divorcee
Don't pretend, d-d-don't pretend
We don't fight fair
We don't fight fair
They say your head can be a prison
Then these are just conjugal visits
People will dissect us
Till this doesn't mean a thing anymore
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me
Wouldn't you rather be a widow than a divorcee
Style your wake for fashion magazines whoaa
Widow or a divorcee
Don't pretend, d-d-don't pretend
We do it in the dark with smiles on our faces
We're trapped and well concealed in secret places, whoa
We do it in the dark with smiles on our faces
We're trapped and well concealed in secret places
We don't fight fair
We don't fight fair
We don't fight fair
We don't fight fair
We don't fight fair
We do it in the dark with smiles on our faces
We're trapped and well concealed in secret places, whoa
We do it in the dark with smiles on our faces
We're trapped and well concealed in secret places
We don't fight fair (We do it in the dark)
With smiles on our faces
We're trapped and well concealed in secret places
We don't fight fair
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me we don't fight fair
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me
We don't fight fair
La de da da
La da da da da
La da da da da da da
When Rome's in ruins
We are the lions
Free of the coliseums
In poison places
We are anti-venom
We're the beginning
Of the end
Tonight the foxes hunt the hounds
And it s all over now
Before it has begun
We've already won
We are wild
We are like young volcanoes (we are, we are, we are)
We are wild
Americana, exotica do you wanna feel a little beautiful oh baby ah!
La de da da

Tonight the foxes hunt the hounds

You could've knocked me out with a feather
I know you've heard this all before but we're just hell's neighbors
Oh oh oh oh, why why why won't the world revolve around me
Build my dreams please grow a all over the streets
But I don't know much about classic cars (cars)
But I got a lot of friends stuck on classic coke (coke)
Down, set, hut, hut, hut, hike, media blitz
Let's hear it for America's Sweethearts
But I must confess I'm in love with my own sins
Let's hear it for America's Sweethearts
But I must confess I'm in love with my own sins
You can bow and pretend
That you don't don't know you're a legend
Oh oh oh, time time time hasn't told anyone else yet
Let my love loose again

But I don't know much about classic cars (cars)
But I got a lot of friends stuck on classic coke (coke)
Down, set, hut, hut, hut, hike, media blitz
Let's hear it for America's Sweethearts
But I must confess I'm in love with my own sins

Let's hear it for, let's hear it
Let's hear it for, let's
Sweethearts
Coming in announced, drive my nails on the tile
I just follow your scent, you can't just follow my smile
Your flaws are aligned with this mood of mine
They cutting me to the bone, they got to leave behind
You wanna kick it to seel just like I was a weapon
I didn't come for a fight but I will fight till the end
This might be your battle, might not turn out okay
You know you look so Seattle, but you feel so LA
Eeh eeh eh eh eh
Eeh eeh eh eh eh
Eeh eeh eh eh eh
Eeh eeh eh eh eh
And I love the way you hurt me it's irresistible
Ooh ooh oh oh oh ho yeah
Ooh ooh oh oh oh ho yeah
I love the way
I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way
I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I'm gonna get you to burst just like you were a bubble
Frame me up on your walls, to keep me out of trouble
Like a moth getting trapped in the light by fixation
Truly free, love it baby, I'm talking no inflation
Too many war wounds and not enough wars
Too few rounds in the ring and not enough settled scores
Too many sharks and not enough blood in the waves
You know I give my love about for falling at it
Eeh eeh eh eh eh
Eeh eeh eh eh eh
Eeh eeh eh eh eh
Eeh eeh eh eh eh
And I love the way you hurt me it's irresistible
Ooh ooh oh oh oh ho yeah
Ooh ooh oh oh oh ho yeah
I love the way
I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way
I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
You're silky and smooth
You're silky and smooth
I breath you in, honey I don't know what you're doing to me
Won't you believe, but the truth catches up with us eventually
Tryina say live, live live live
I'm no good good, admit to this
Second is yours,???
I still love the way you hurt me,
It's irresistible!
Ooh ooh oh oh oh ho yeah
Ooh ooh oh oh oh ho yeah
I love the way
I love the way
I love the way you hurt me baby
I love the way
I love the way
I love the way you hurt me baby
It's all a game of this or that, now versus then
They're better off against worse for wear
And you're someone who knows someone
Who knows someone I once knew
And I just want to be a part of that.
The road outside my house is paved with good intentions
Hired a construction crew 'cuz it's hell on the engine
And you are the dreamer, and we are the dream
I could write it better than you ever felt it
So hum hallelujah, just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, and it's just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'till tonight do us part
I sing the blues and you swallow them too
My words are my faith, to hell with our good name,
We mix up your guts, your insides x-rayed
And one day we'll get nostalgic for disaster
We're a bull, your ears are just a china shop
I love you in the same way, there's chapel in a hospital
One foot in your bedroom, and one foot out the door
Sometimes we take chances, sometimes we take pills
I could write it better than you ever felt it
So hum hallelujah, just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, and it's just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'till tonight do us part
I sing the blues and you swallow them too
(Hum hallelujah, hum hallelujah)
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'till tonight do us part
I sing the blues and swallow them too
So hum hallelujah, just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, and it's just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'till tonight do us part
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'till tonight do us part
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'till tonight do us part
I sing the blues and you swallow them too.
I was just an only child of the universe
And then I found you
And then I found you
You are the sun and I am just the planets
Spinning around you
Spinning around you
You were too good to be true
Gold platted
But what's inside you
But what's inside you
I know the whole damn city thinks it needs you
But not as much as I do
Not as much as I do
Cause you're the last of a dying breed
Write our names on the wet concrete
I wonder if your therapist knows
Everything about me
I'm here in search of you're glory
There's been a million before me
That ultra kind of love
You never walk away from
You're just the last of the real ones
I am a collapsing star with tunnel vision
But only for you
But only for you
My head is stripped, just a screw that's been tightened too many times
When I think of you
When I think of you
I will shield you from the waves
If they find you
I will protect you
I will protect you
Just tell me tell me I am the only one
Even if it's not true
Even if it's not true
Cause you're the last of a dying breed
Write our names on the wet concrete
I wonder if your therapist knows
Everything about me
I'm here in search of you're glory
There's been a million before me
That ultra kind of love
You never walk away from
You're just the last of the real ones
I'm here at the beginning of the end
The end of infinity with you
I'm done with having dreams
The thing that I believe
You drain all the fear from me
I got troubled thoughts and the self-esteem to match
What a catch!
What a catch!
Whoa
You'll never catch us so just let me be
Said I'll be fine 'til the hospital or American embassy
Ms. Flack, said I still want you back
Yeah, Ms. Flack, said I still want you back
I got troubled thoughts and the self-esteem to match
What a catch!
What a catch!
And all I can think of is the way I'm the one who charmed the one
Who gave up on you
Who gave up on you
They say the captain goes down with the ship
So, when the world ends, will God go down with it?
Ms. Flack, said I still want you back
Yeah, Ms. Flack, said I still want you back
I got troubled thoughts and the self-esteem to match
What a catch!
What a catch!
And all I can think of is the way I'm the one who charmed the one
Who gave up on you
Who gave up on you
What a catch, what a catch
What a catch, what a catch
I will never end up like him
Behind my back, I already am
Keep a calendar this way you will always know
I said I got troubled thoughts and the self-esteem to match
What a catch!
What a catch!
And all I can think of is the way I'm the one who charmed the one
Who gave up on you
Who gave up on you
(Where is your boy tonight
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know)
(We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're goin' down swinging)
(Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance, these are the lives you'd love to lead)
(This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race...)
(One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories
Even though they weren't so great
He tastes like you, only sweeter...)
I got troubled thoughts and the self-esteem to match
What a catch!
What a catch!
Oh God!
Sean Don
Fall Out... boy!
Did-did you trip down 12 steps into Malibu
(Malibu, ooh, ooh, ooh)
So why the hell is there a light that's keeping us forever
Bel Air baby, did you get dressed up?
Pretty pout, pout
(While you bottomed out out)
I can't stop it when there's chemicals keeping us together
Uh, uh, uh, I'm singing
Whoa, how the mighty fall
The mighty fall
The mighty fall
They fall in love
How the mighty fall
The mighty fall
The mighty fall
Oh how the mighty fall in love
Your crooked love is just a pyramid scheme
And I'm dizzy on dreams (and I'm dizzy on dreams)
But if you ask me two's a whole lot lonelier than one
B-baby we should have left our love in the gutter where we found it
(Gutter where we found it)
Cause you think you think your only crime is that you got caught
I'm singing
Whoa, how the mighty fall
The mighty fall
The mighty fall
They fall in love
How the mighty fall
The mighty fall
The mighty fall
Oh how the mighty fall in love
It's getting clear
You're never coming clean
So I'll lock you up inside
And swallow
Swallow the key
Hello?
Yeah I know you said not to call unless I'm dying
But I'm driving and I can't stop staring at my eyelids
But even though my eyes closed, I still see you
I just hope that when you see me I'm not see-through
You know how we do
Some times I swear, I need a day just for me to lay
With some T and A, but the way we, they way we is do deeper
Baby straight up chemistry DNA
Make me wanna give you every dollar out my B of A
Like, I let her climb on top
I'm either fuckin' or workin', so the grind don't stop
They say I got screws missing, well hell, only when I'm missing you
And hell yeah I'm addict, girl, addicted to you
Whoa, how the mighty fall
The mighty fall
The mighty fall
They fall in love
How the mighty fall
The mighty fall
The mighty fall
Oh how the mighty fall in love
I've loved everything about you that hurts,
So let me see your moves,
Let me see your moves,
Lips pressed close to mine
True Blue, but the prince of any failing empire knows that
Everybody wants
Everybody wants to drive on through the night,
If it's the drive back home
Things aren't the same anymore,
Some nights it gets so bad that I almost pick up the phone
Trade Baby Blues, for Wide-Eyed Browns
I sleep with your old shirts
And walk through this house in your shoes
I know it's strange
It's a strange way of saying that I know I'm supposed to love you
I'm supposed to love you
I've already given up on myself twice
(But the) third time is the charm,
Third time is the charm
Threw caution to the wind,
But I've got a lousy arm,
And I've traced your shadows on the wall
Now I kiss them whenever I'm down,
Whenever I'm down
(Just kind of) figured on
Not figuring myself out
Things aren't the same anymore,
Some nights it gets so bad that I almost pick up the phone
Trade Baby Blues, for Wide-Eyed Browns
I sleep with your old shirts
And walk through this house in your shoes
I know it's strange
It's a strange way of saying that I know I'm supposed to love you
I'm supposed to love you
I was born under a bad sign,
But you saved my life
That night on the roof of your hotel
"Cross my heart and hope to die,
Splinter from the headboard in my eye"
Photo-proofed kisses I remember so well
Trade Baby Blues, for Wide-Eyed Browns
I sleep with your old shirts
And walk through this house in your shoes
I know it's strange
It's a strange way of saying that I know I'm supposed to love you
I'm supposed to love you
If "home is where the heart is"
Then we're all just fucked
I can't remember
I can't remember
And I want it so bad
I'd shoot the sunshine into my veins
I can't remember the good old days
And it's kind of funny,
The way we're wearing anchors on our shirts
When being anchored or bored just feels like a curse
My mind is a safe
And if I keep it in we all get rich
My body is an orphanage
"We take everyone in"
Doing lines of dust and sweat
Off last night's stage
Just to feel like you
The milligrams in my head
Burning tobacco in the wind
Chasing the direction,
chasing the direction you went
You're a bottled star
The planets align
You're just like Mars
You shine in the sky
You shine in the sky
Are all the good times getting gone?
They come and go and go and come and go
I've got a lot of friends who are stars
but some are just black holes
My mind is a safe
And if I keep in then we all get rich
My body is an orphanage
"We take everyone in"
Doing lines of dust and sweat
Off last night's stage
Just to feel like you(oh)
And it's kind of funny
The way we're wearing anchors on our shirts
When being anchored or bored just feels like a curse
My mind is a safe
And if I keep it in we all get rich
My body is an orphanage
"We take everyone in"
Doing lines of dust and sweat
Off last night's stage
Just to feel like you
If "home is where the heart is"
Then we're all just fucked
I got those jet pack blues
Just like Judy
The kind that make June feel like September
I'm the last one that you'll ever remember
And I'm trying to find my peace of mind
Behind these two white highway lines
When the city goes silent
The ringing in my ears gets violent
She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing "Baby come home" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time
And I remember "Baby, come home"
I remember "Baby, come home"
I remember "Baby, come home"
I remember "Baby, come home"
Did you ever love her? Do you know?
Or did you never want to be alone?
And she was singing "Baby, come home"
I remember "Baby, come home"
I've got those jet pack blues
Fight off the light tonight and just stay with me
Honey, don't you leave
Don't you remember how we used to split a drink?
It never mattered what it was
I think our hands were just that close
The sweetness never lasted, no
She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing "Baby come home" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time
And I remember "Baby, come home"
I remember "Baby, come home"
I remember "Baby, come home"
I remember "Baby, come home"
Did you ever love her? Do you know?
Or did you never want to be alone?
And she was singing "Baby, come home"
I remember "Baby, come home"
She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing "Baby come home" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time
And I remember "Baby, come home"
I remember "Baby, come home"
I remember "Baby, come home"
I remember "Baby, come home"
Did you ever love her? Do you know?
Or did you never want to be alone?
And she was singing "Baby, come home"
I remember "Baby, come home"
II don't know where you're going,
But do you got room for one more troubled soul
I don't know where I'm going,
But I don't think I'm coming home
And I said, I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead
This is the road to ruin and we're starting at the end
Say, yeah
Let's be alone together
We could stay young forever
Scream it from the top of your lungs, lungs, lungs
Say, yeah
Let's be alone together
We can stay young forever
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
Cut me off, I lost my track
It's not my fault, I'm a maniac
It's not funny anymore, no it's not
My heart is like a stallion, they love it more when it's broken
Do you wanna feel beautiful, do you wanna, yeah
I'm outside the door, invite me in
So we can go back and play pretend
I'm on deck, yeah I'm up next
Tonight I'm high as a private jet
'Cause I don't know where you're going,
But do you got room for one more troubled soul
I don't know where I'm going, but I don't think I'm coming home
And I said, I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead
This is the road to ruin and we're starting at the end
Say, yeah
Let's be alone together
We could stay young forever
Scream it from the top of your lungs, lungs, lungs
Say, yeah
Let's be alone together
We can stay young forever
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
My heart is like a stallion, they love it more when it's broken
Do you wanna feel beautiful, do you wanna, yeah
I'm outside the door, invite me in

I'm on deck, yeah I'm up next
Tonight I'm high as a private jet
Yeah
Let's be alone together

Scream it from the top of your lungs, lungs, lungs
Say, yeah
Let's be alone together
We can stay young forever
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young
I don't know where you're going,
But do you got room for one more troubled soul
I don't know where I'm going, but I don't think I'm coming home
And I said, I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead
This is the road to ruin and we're starting at the end
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Woaah, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Waaoh, Oh, Oh
Life's just a pace car on death
Only less diligent
And when the two collide
It's no coincidence
The lights are on and everybody's home
The only thing suicidal here is the door
We had a good run
Even I have to admit
Life's just a pace car on death
Only less diligent
Hell or Glory
I don't want anything in between
Then came a baby boy with long eyelashes
And Daddy said you gotta show the world
The thunder (Woah)
The Thunder (Woah)
The Thunder (Woah)
The Thunder (Woah)
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Woaah, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Woahh, Oh, Oh
We didn't come to compete
This is a demonstration
Even the young ones become irrelevant
They always bring up how you've changed
Never the same person when I go to sleep
As when I wake up
As when I wake up
Bop bop ba dop
Ba dop op ba dop
Ba dop op ba dop
Ba dop op ba dop
Hell or Glory
I don't want anything in between
Then came a baby boy with long eyelashes
And Daddy said you gotta show the world
The Thunder (Woah)
The Thunder (Woah)
The Thunder (Woah)
The Thunder (Woah)
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Woaah, Oh, Oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Woaah, Oh, Oh
Hell or Glory
I don't want anything in between
Then came a baby boy with long eyelashes
And Daddy said you gotta show the world
The Thunder (Woah)
The Thunder (Woah)
The Thunder (Woah)
The Thunder (Woah)
He Said Bring The Thunder (Woah)
The Thunder
Woah
The Thunder
Woah, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh
Ohh
Brothers and sisters put this record down
Take my advice ('cause we are bad news)
We will leave you high and dry
It's not worth the hearing you'll lose
It's just past 8 and I'm feeling young and reckless
The ribbon on my wrist says, "Do not open before Christmas."
We're only liars, but we're the best (we're the best)
We're only good for the latest trends
We're only good cause you can have almost famous friends
Besides, we've got such good fashion sense
Brothers and sisters, yeah, put these words down
Into your notebook (spit lines like these)
We're friends when you're on your knees
Make them dance like we were shooting their feet
It's just past 8 and I'm feeling young and reckless
The ribbon on my wrist says, "Do not open before Christmas."
We're only liars, but we're the best (we're the best)
We're only good for the latest trends
We're only good cause you can have almost famous friends
Besides, we've got such good fashion sense
We're only liars, but we're the best
We're only good for the latest trends
We're only liars, but we're the best
We're only good for the latest trends
We're only good cause you can have almost famous friends
Besides, we've got such good fashion sense
[Paper Planes intro]
[Verse 1]
I was I was I was I was
Gonna say something that would solve all our problems
But then I got drunk and I forgot what I was talking about
I forgot what I was talking..
Don't you, don't you, don't you know
There's nothing more cruel than to be loved by everybody
There's nothing more cruel than to be loved by everybody but you
Than to be loved by everybody but you, but you
[Pre Chorus]
If I could get my shit together
I'm gonna run away and never see any of you again
Never see any of you again
[Chorus]
I hope the roof flies off and we get sucked up into space
I always make such expensive mistakes
I know it's just a number but you're my 8th wonder
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
(Whoa, whoa)
When they make a darker color
(Oh, oh)
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
[Verse 2]
On the wrong side of p-p-paradise
And when I say I'm sorry I mean I wasn't showing up at all
I really mean I didn't plan on showing up at all
Don't you, don't you, don't you know
I hate all my friends, I miss the days when I pretended
I hate all my friends, I miss the days when I pretended with you
I miss the days when I pretended with you, with you
[Pre Chorus]
If I can get my shit together
I'm gonna run away and never see any of you again
Never see any of you again
[Chorus]
I hope the roof flies off and we get sucked up into space
I always make such expensive mistakes
I know it's just a number but you're my 8th wonder
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
(Whoa, whoa)
When they make a darker color
(Oh, oh)
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
(Whoa, whoa)
When they make a darker color
(Oh, oh)
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
[Bridge]
If we hadn't done this thing
I think I'd be a medicine man
So I could get high on my own supply whenever I can
I became such a strange shape, such a strange shape
From trying to fit in
I became such a strange shape, such a strange shape
[Chorus]
I hope the roof flies off and we get sucked up into space
I always make such expensive mistakes
I know it's just a number but you're my 8th wonder
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
(Whoa, whoa)
When they make a darker color
(Oh, oh)
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
(Whoa, whoa)
I'll stop wearing black
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
Have you ever wanted to disappear
And join a monastery
Go out and preach on Manic Street?
Who will I be when I wake up next to a stranger?
On a passenger plane?
(Passenger plane)
Permanent jet lag
Please take me back, (please take me back)
Please take me back
I'm a stray dog sick
Please let me in, (please let me in)
The mad key's tripping
Singing vows before we exchange smoke rings
Give me a pen
Call me Mr. Benzedrine
But don't let the doctor in I wanna blow off steam
Call me Mr. Benzedrine
But don't let the doctor
Don't let the doctor in
It feels like fourteen carats but no clarity
When I look at the man who would be king
The man who would be king
Goes to the desert
The same war his dad rehearsed
Came back with flags on coffins and said
"We won, oh we won"
Permanent jet lag
Please take me back, (please take me back)
Please take me back, ooh
I'm a stray dog sick
Please let me in, (please let me in)
The mad key's tripping
Singing vows before we exchange smoke rings
Give me a pen
Call me Mr. Benzedrine
But don't let the doctor in
I wanna blow off steam
Call me Mr. Benzedrine
But don't let the doctor
Don't let the doctor in
Ba-ba-ba-ba benzedrine
My, my, my, benzedrine
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba benzedrine ah
Ba-ba-ba-ba benzedrine
My, my, my benzedrine
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba benzedrine, ah
Only one book really matters
The rest of the proof is on the television
Call me Mr. Benzedrine
But don't let the doctor in
I wanna blow off steam
Call me Mr. Benzedrine
But don't let the doctor
Don't let the doctor in, oh, oh, ooh
Have you ever wanted to disappear?
It's not me, it's you
Actually, it's the taxidermy of you and me
Untie the balloons from around my neck and ground me
I'm just a racehorse on the track
Send me back to the glue factory
Always thought I'd float away
And never come back
But I've got enough miles on my card
To fly the boys home on my own
But you know me: I like being all alone
And keeping you all alone
And the charts are boring
And the kids are snoring
And my egos in a sling
You say you're not listening and I said I'm wishing
And I said... I said
Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman.
Maybe he won't find out what I know:
you were the last good thing about this part of town.
When I wake up,
I'm willing to take my chances on the hope I forget
that you hate him more than you notice
I wrote this for you.
You need him,
I could be him...
I could be an accident but I'm still trying.
That's more than I can say for him.
Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman.
Maybe he won't find out what I know:
You were the last good thing about this part of town.
Someday I'll appreciate in value,
get off my ass and call you
in the meantime I'll sport my
brand new fashion of waking up with pants on at four in the afternoon.
You need him
I could be him
I could be an accident but I'm still trying.
That's more than I can say for him.
Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman.
Maybe he won't find out what I know:
you were the last good thing about this part of town.
(Won't find out) He won't find out
(Won't find out) He won't find out
Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman. (Won't find out)
Maybe he won't find out what I know:
You were the last good thing about this part of town.
Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman.
Maybe he won't find out what I know:
You were the last good thing about this part of town.
Hope this is the last time
'Cause I'd never say no to you
This conversation's been
Dead on arrival
And there's no way
To talk to you
This conversation's been
Dead on
A rivalry goes so deep
Between me
And this loss of sleep
Over you
This is side one
Flip me over
I know, I'm not your
Favorite record
But the songs you grow to like
Never stick at first
So, I'm writing you a And here is your verse
No, it's not the last time
'Cause I'd never say no to you
This conversation's still
Dead on arrival
And there's no way
To talk, to you
When you're
Dead on
A rivalry goes so deep
Between me
And this loss of sleep
Over you
This is side one
Flip me over
I know I'm not your
Favorite record
But the songs you grow to like
Never stick at first
So I'm writing you a And here is your
This is side one
Flip me over
I know I'm not your
Favorite record, oh no, so
This is side one
Flip me over
This is side one
Flip me over
I know I'm not your
Favorite record
The songs you grow to like
Never stick at first
So I'm writing you a And here is your verse
Here is your verse
[Intro]
If you were church, I'd get on my knees
Confess my love, I'd know where to be
My sanctuary, you're holy to me
If you were church, I'd get on my knees
I'd get on my knees, I'd get on my knees
[Verse 1]
Take the pain
Make it billboard big and swallow it for me
Time capsule for the future
Trust me, that's what I will be
Oh, the things that you do in the name of what you love
You are doomed but just enough
You are doomed but just enough
[Chorus]
If you were church, whoo
I'd get on my knees, yeah
Confess my love, I'd know where to be
My sanctuary, you're holy to me
If you were church, yeah, I'd get on my knees
I'd get on my knees, whoo
I'd get on my knees
I'd get on my knees
[Verse 2]
I love the world but I just don't love the way it makes me feel
Got a few more fake friends
And it's getting hard to know what's real
And if death is the last appointment
Then we're all just sitting in the waiting room (Mr. Stump!)
I am just a human trying to avoid my certain doom
[Chorus]
If you were church, yeah
I'd get on my knees
Confess my love, I'd know where to be
My sanctuary, you're holy to me
If you were church, yeah, I'd get on my knees
I'd get on my knees, yeah, oh
I'd get on my knees, ah ah ah
I'd get on my knees, yeah
I'd get on my knees
If you were church
I'd get on my knees
Confess my love, I'd know where to be
My sanctuary, you're holy to me, you're holy to me
If you were church, yeah, I'd get on my knees, yeah
I'm good to go
And I'm going nowhere fast
It could be worse
I could be taking you there with me
I'm good to go
Though it looks like I'm still on my own
I'm good to go for something golden
Though the motions I've been going through have failed
And I'm coasting on potential towards a wall
At a hundred miles an hour
When I say
Two more weeks
My foot is in the door, yeah
I can't sleep in the wake of Saturday
Saturday
When these open doors were open-ended
Saturday
When these open doors were open-ended
Pete and I attacked the laws of Astoria
With promise and prescision
And a mess of youthful innocence
And I read about the afterlife
But I never really lived more than an hour (more than an hour)
When I say
Two more weeks
My foot is in the door, yeah
I can't sleep in the wake of Saturday
Saturday
When these open doors were open-ended
Saturday
When these open doors were open-ended
And I read about the afterlife
But I never really lived
And I read about the afterlife
But I never really lived
Two more weeks
My foot is in the door
Me and Pete
In the wake of Saturday
Saturday
When these open doors were open-ended
Saturday
When these open doors were open-ended
Saturday, Saturday
Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town
When I wake up
I'm willin' to take my chances on
The hope I forget that you hate him
More than you notice I wrote this for you
You need him, I could be him
Could be an accident but I'm still tryin'
And it's more than I can say for him
Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
And maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town
Someday I'll appreciate in value
Get off my ass and call you
In the meantime I'll sport my brand new fashion
Of waking up with pants on at 4 in the afternoon
You need him, I could be him
I could be an accident but I'm still tryin'
And it's more than I can say for him
Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
And maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town
Won't find out
(He won't find out)
Won't find out
(He won't find out)
Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
And maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town
Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
And maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town.
I'm coming apart at the seams
Pitching myself for leads in other people's dreams now
Like Buzz, buzz, buzz
Doc, there's a hole where something was
Doc, there's a hole where something was
Fell out of bed,
Butterfly bandage, but don't worry
You'll never remember, your head is far too blurry.
Put him in the back of a squad car restrain that man
He needs his head put through a catscan
Hey, editor, I'm undeniable!
Hey, doctor, I'm certifiable!
I'm a loose bolt of a complete machine
What a match, I'm half doomed and you're semi-sweet
So boycott love
Detox just to retox
And I'd promise you anything for another shot at life
And perfect boys with their perfect lives
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy
(Wants to hear you sing about tragedy)
Ohh
Little girl, you got me staring odd
Oh!
Or was that just a telescopic camera nod
P-p-painted dolls in the highway truckstop stalls
Lot lizard scales cool your nightlife moods
All the rookies leave your badge and your gun on the desk
When you leave the room
I'm a loose bolt of a complete machine
What a match, I'm half doomed and you're semi-sweet
Boycott love
Detox just to retox
And I'd promise you anything for another shot at life
And perfect boys with their perfect lives
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy
(Wants to hear you sing about tragedy)
Detox
Just to retox
Detox
Just to retox
Detox
Just to retox
Detox
Just to retox
Detox (So boycott love)
Just to retox
Detox (Boycott love)
Just to retox
Detox (Boycott love)
Just to retox
Detox (Boycott love)
Just to retox
So boycott love (Boycott love)
Detox just to retox
And I'd promise you anything for another shot at life
And perfect boys with their perfect lives
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy
(Wants to hear you sing)
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy
(Wants to hear you sing about tragedy)
Until your breathing stops, stops, stops
Until your breathing stops, stops, stops
Until your, your, your, your, your forever, forever
I need more dreams
And less life
And I need that dark
In a little more light
I cried tears you'll never see
So fuck you, you can go cry me an ocean
And leave me be
You are what you love
Not who loves you
In a world full of the word yes
I'm here to scream
No, no
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
I only plugged in to save rock and roll
Rock and roll, no
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
I only plugged in to save rock and roll
Blood brothers in desperation
An oath of silence
For the voice of our generation
How'd it get to be only me?
Like I'm the last damn kid still kicking
That still believes
I will defend the faith
Going down swinging
I will save the songs
That we can't stop singing
No, no
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
I only plugged in to save rock and roll
Rock and roll, no
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
I only plugged in to save rock and roll
Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know when to quit, oh oh
Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know when to quit, oh oh
Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know when to quit, oh oh
Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know when to quit, oh oh
You are what you love
Not who loves you
In a world full of the word 'yes'
I'm here to scream
No, no
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
I only plugged in to save rock and roll
Rock and roll, no
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
I only plugged in to save rock and roll
Oh no, we won't go
We don't know when to quit, oh oh
Oh no, we won't go
We don't know when to quit, oh oh
No, no
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
Only plugged in to save rock and roll
No, no
Wherever I go, go
Trouble seems to follow
Only plugged in to save rock and roll
We take sour sips from life's lush lips
& we shake, shake, shake the hips in relationships
Stomp out this disaster town!
You'll put your eyes to the sun & say, I know
You're only blinding to keep back what the clouds are hiding
& we might've started singing just a little soon
We're throwing stones at a glass moon
Whoa
We're so miserable & stunning
Whoa
Love songs for the genuinely cunning
Whoa
We keep the beat with your blistered feet
& we bullet the words at the mockingbirds singing
Slept through the weekend & dreaming
Of sinking with the melody of the cliffs of eternity
Got postcards from my former selves saying how've you been
We might've said goodbyes just a little soon
(Stomp out this disaster town)
Robbing lips & kissing banks under this moon
Whoa
We're so miserable & stunning
Whoa
Love songs for the genuinely cunning
Whoa
We're so miserable & stunning
Whoa
Love songs for the genuinely cunning
Oh
It was ice cream headaches & sweet avalanche
When the pearls in our shells got up to dance
You call me a bad tipper of the cradle
Tired yawns for fawns on hunter's lawns
We're the has-beens of husbands
Sharpening the knives of young wives
Take two years, & call me when you're better
Take teardrops of mine, find yourself wetter
Whoa
We're so miserable & stunning
Whoa
Love songs for the genuinely cunning
Whoa
We're so miserable & stunning
Whoa
Love songs for the genuinely cunning

I think I fell in love again
Maybe I just took too much cough medicine
I'm the best worst thing that hasn't happened to you yet
The best worst thing (Woah)
You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out
You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out
And you can kill me, kill me or let God sort 'em out
And you can kill me, kill me or (Woah)

I wish I dreamt in the shape of your mouth
But it's your thread count I really care about
Stay up 'til the lights go out
Stay up, Stay up
You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out
You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out
And as we're drifting off to sleep
All those dirty thoughts of me
They were never yours to keep, keep (Woah)
Altered boys, altered boys
We're the things that love destroyed
(I'm an American, I'm an American)
You, me, us, them
We're just resurrection men
(I'm an American, I'm an American)
Us, we were only there, to make you live again
(I'm an American, I'm an American)
Us, we were pity sex, nothing more and nothing less
(I'm an American)

Show me the way to heaven's gate
Show me the way and i'll walk
Tell me the way to redemption's door
Time ticking on the clock
Tell me the way to redemptions door
Answer me when i knock
I'll follow them to jerusalem
It cant be that far
I'll follow them to jerusalem
Just tell me who they are
Show me the way to heaven's gate
Show me the way and i'll walk
Show me the way to heavens gate
Listen when i talk
Birds have wings and winds to fly
They carry no demands
We have notes and songs that cry
praying with our hands
All the mistakes a man can make
being on this road so long
All the mistakes a man can make
Must they all be wrong
Show the me the way to heavens gate
Now that i forgot
Show the me the way to heavens gate
Show me the face of god
I confess, I messed up.
Dropping "I'm sorry" like you're still around.
And I know you dressed up.
"Hey kid, you'll never live this down."
'Cause you're just the girl all the boys want to dance with.
And I'm just the boy who's had too many chances.
I'm sleeping on your folk's porch again, dreaming.
She said, she said, she said, "Why don't you just drop dead?"
I don't blame you for being you
But you can't blame me for hating it.
So say, "What are you waiting for?
Kiss her, kiss her."
I set my clocks early cause I know I'm always late.
Write me off, give up on me.
'Cause darling what did you expect?
I'm just off, a lost cause, a long shot, don't even take this bet.
You can make all the moves, you can aim all the spotlights
Get all the sighs and the moans just right.
I'm sleeping on your folk's porch again, dreaming.
She said, she said, she said, "Why don't you just drop dead?"
I don't blame you for being you
But you can't blame me for hating it.
So say, "What are you waiting for?
Kiss her, kiss her."
I set my clocks early cause I know I'm always late.
(Always on, always on.)
You said you'd keep me honest
(Always on, always on.)
But I won't call you on it.
(Always on, always on.)
I don't blame you for being you
But you can't blame me for hating it.
So say, "What are you waiting for?
Kiss her, kiss her."
I set my clocks early cause I know I'm always late.
I set my clocks early cause I know I'm always late.
I think I got too many memories getting in the way of me
I'm about to go Tonya Harding on the whole world's knee
And I'm stuck, night vision
So stuck night vision
But I come to life, come to life
Some princes don't become kings
Even at the best times I'm out of my mind
You only get what you grieve
Are you smelling that shit?
Are you smelling that shit?
Eau de résistance
The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey
The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey
I testify if I die in my sleep
Then know that my life was just a killer dream, yeah
Seems like the whole damn world went and lost its mind
And all my childhood heroes have fallen off or died
Fake tears, we are living fake tears
But the alcohol never lies, never lies
Some princes don't become kings
Even at the best times I'm out of my mind
You only get what you grieve
Are you smelling that shit?
Are you smelling that shit?
Eau de résistance
The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey
The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey
I testify if I die in my sleep
Then know that my life was just a killer dream, yeah
Then know that my life was just a killer dream, yeah
I testify
I testify
Are you smelling that shit?
Eau de résistance
Hey, hey, hey
Some princes don't become kings
Even at the best of times I'm out of my mind
You only get what you grieve
Are you smelling that shit?
Are you smelling that shit?
The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey
The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey
I testify if I die in my sleep
Then know that my life was just a killer dream, yeah
Then know that my life was just a killer dream, yeah
Are you smelling that shit?
Eau de résistance
I'm a young one,
Stuck in the thoughts
Of an old one's head
When all the others were just stirring awake
I'm trying to trick myself to fall asleep again, woah
My head's in heaven, my soles are in hell
Let's meet in the purgatory of my hips and get well
Hurry, hurry
You put my head in such a flurry, flurry
Oh freckle, freckle
What makes you so special?
What makes you so special?
I'm gonna leave you
I'm gonna teach you
How we're all alone
How we're all alone
Guild me, build me
It's your club, so let me in (let me in)
Knowing how heartwarming
It is inside your skin
My head's in heaven, my soles are in hell
Let's meet in the purgatory of my hips and get well
Hurry, hurry
You put my head in such a flurry, flurry
Oh freckle, freckle
What makes you so special?
What makes you so special?
I'm gonna leave you
I'm gonna teach you
How we're all alone
How we're all alone
How we're all alone
Hurry, hurry
You put my head in such a flurry, flurry
Oh freckle, freckle
What makes you so special?
What makes you so special?
I'm gonna leave you
I'm gonna teach you
How we're all alone
How we're all alone
Mama
If we don't take the medication
We won't sleep for days
We won't sleep for days
Mama
If we pray to the lord
Does he sing on a stage?
Does he sing on a stage?
We waste it all in the back of a long dark car
And I'm a sunshine machine
I want to get stuck
I want to get stuck
And be golden in your memory
This is a black, black ski mask song
So put all of your anger on
In the truly gruesome do we trust
I will always land on you like a sucker punch
Singing I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
If you knew, knew what the bluebirds sing at you, you would never sing along
Cast them out 'cause this is our culture
These new flocks are nothing but vultures
Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled it up with novocaine and now I'm just numb
Now I'm just numb
And leave me, don't mind me, I'm just a son of a gun
So don't stop, don't stop 'till your heart goes numb
And now I'm just numb
I don't feel a thing for you
I'm just a problem that doesn't wanna be solved
So could you please hold your applause
Take this sideshow and all its freaks
And turn it into the silver screen dream
Singing I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
If you knew, knew what the bluebirds sing at you, you would never sing along
Cast them out 'cause this is our culture
These new flocks are nothing but vultures
Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled it up with novocaine and now I'm just numb
Now I'm just numb
And leave me, don't mind me, I'm just a son of a gun
So don't stop, don't stop 'till your heart goes numb
And now I'm just numb
I don't feel a thing for you
I said one day the valley is gonna swallow me whole
I feel like a photo that's been overexposed
Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled it up with novocaine and now I'm just numb
Now I'm just numb
And leave me, don't mind me, I'm just a son of a gun
So don't stop, don't stop 'till your heart goes numb
And now I'm just numb
I don't feel a thing for you
We've gone way too fast for way too long
And we were never supposed to make it half this far
And I lived so much life, lived so much life
I think that God is gonna have to kill me twice
Kill me twice like my name was Nikki Sixx
I woke up in my shoes again but somewhere you exist singing
Oops I, did it again, I forgot what I was losing my mind about
Oh, I only wrote this down to make you press rewind
And send a message that I was young and a menace
Woke up on the wrong side of reality
And there's a madness that's just coursing right through me
And as far as the time, far as the time
Not sure I'm there yet but I'm searching out the ride
Oops I, did it again, I forgot what I was losing my mind about
Oh, I only wrote this down to make you press rewind
And send a message that I was young and a menace
If I am off the deep end
I'm just here to become the best yet
I'm just here for the psych assessment
I'm just here for the... The...
We've gone way too fast for way too long
I'm pedal to the metal make no mistake
This is my pity party, pity party
And I'm living out of time, eternal heatstroke
Spiritual revolt from the waist down
From the waist down
I'm just a full tank away from freedom
A spitfire
These are the last blues we're ever gonna have
Let's see how deep we get
The glow of the cities below lead us back
To the places that we never should have left
The last blues we're ever gonna have
Let's see how deep we'll get
The glow of the cities below lead us back
To the places that we never should have left
The last, the last, the last
The last, the last, the last
The last, the last, the last
The last, the last, the last
I got a feeling inside that I can't domesticate
It doesn't wanna live in a cage
A feeling that I can't housebreak
And I'm yours
'Til the earth starts to crumble and the heavens roll away
I'm struggling to exist with you and without you, yeah
I'm just a full tank away from freedom
A spitfire
These are the last blues we're ever gonna have
Let's see how deep we get
The glow of the cities below lead us back
To the places that we never should have left
The last blues we're ever gonna have
Let's see how deep we'll get
The glow of the cities below lead us back
To the places that we never should have left
The last, the last, the last
The last, the last, the last
The last, the last, the last
The last, the last, the last
I'm sifting through the sand, sand, sand, sand
Looking through pieces of broken hourglass
Trying to get it all back
Put it back together
As if the time had never passed
I know I should walk away, know I should walk away
But I just want to let you break my brain
And I can't seem to get a grip
No, no matter how I live with it
These are the last blues, yeah
The glow of the cities below lead us back
To the places that we never should have left
The last blues we're ever gonna have
Let's see how deep we'll get
The glow of the cities below lead us back
To the places that we never should have left
The last, the last, the last
The last, the last, the last
The last, the last, the last
The last, the last, the last
I found the cure to growing older
And you're the only place that feels like, home
Just so you know, you'll never know
Some secrets were meant to be told,
but I found the cure to growing older
I'm the first kid to write of hearts, lies, and friends
And I am sorry my conscience called in sick again,
And I've got arrogance down to a science
Oh, and I'm the first kid to write of hearts, lies, and friends now
Douse yourself in cheap perfume
It's so fitting, so fitting of the way you are
You can't cover it up, can't cover it up!
So douse yourself in cheap perfume
It's so fitting, so fitting of the way you are
You can't cover it up, can't cover it up! No
Find a safe place, brace yourself, bite your lips
I'm sending your fingernails and empty bottles you've sipped
Back to your family "cause I know you will be missed"
So you can find a safe place, brace yourself
They call kids like us vicious and carved out of stone
But for what we've become, we just feel more alone
Always weigh what I've got against what I left
So progress report, I am missing you to death
Douse yourself in cheap perfume
It's so fitting, so fitting of the way you are
Can't cover it up, can't cover it up
So douse yourself in cheap perfume
It's so, so fitting, so fitting of the way you are
Can't cover it up, can't cover it up, no
Someone old

A beautiful girl can make you dizzy,
Like you've been drinking jack and coke all morning.
She can make you feel high,
Full of the single greatest commodity known to man:
Promise. promise of a better day,
promise of a greater hope,
promise of a new tomorrow.
This particular aura,
can be found in the gait of a beautiful girl.
In her smile, and in her soul.
In the way she makes every rotten little thing about life
seem like it's gonna be ok.
(sung)
September never stays this cold,
Where I come from and you know,
I'm not one, for complaining.
But I love the way you roll
Excuses off the tip of your tongue,
As I (slowly) slowly, quietly, slowly, fall apart.
This won't mean a thing come tomorrow,
And that's exactly how I'll make it seem.
'Cause I'm still not sleeping,
Thinking I've crawled home from worse than this.
So please, please, (please)
I'm running out of sympathy,(I'm running out of sympathy)
I never said I'd take this,
I never said I'd take this lying down.
She says, "C'mon c'mon,
Lets just get this over with."(3x)
I never said I'd take this lying down.
Well I've crawled home from worse than this,
From worse than this!
You always come close
But this never comes easy.
I still know everything.(3x)
You always come close
But this never comes easy.(2x)
I never said I'd take this lying down.(2x)
You always come!
You're coming close.
I never said I'd take this lying down.
But I've crawled home from worse than this.
If it's not keeping you up at night,
Then what's the point?(4x)
I'm in your room,
Well is this turning you on?
Am I turning you on?
I'm in your room,
Are you turned on?
I'm on the corner of your bed
Are you turned on?(2x)
I comb the crowd and pick you out
My mouth moves too fast for you to figure it out
It starts eyes closed to fingers crossed
"To I swear, I say"
"To I swear, I say"
To hands between legs, to "whatever it takes"
To drinks at the club to the bar
To the keys to your car
To hotel stairs, to the emergency exit door, no
To the love, I left my conscience pressed
Between the pages of the Bible in the drawer
"What did it ever do for me?" I say
It never calls me when I'm down
Love never wanted me but I took it anyway
Put your ear to the speaker
And choose love or sympathy
But never both, love never wanted me
I hoped you choked and crashed your car
Hey, "tear catcher", that's all that you are
And ever were from the start
"I swear, I say"
"I swear, I say"
To hands between legs, to "whatever it takes"
To drinks at the club to the bar
To the keys to your car
To hotel stairs, to the emergency exit door, no
To the "love", I left my conscience pressed
Between the pages of the Bible in the drawer
"What did it ever do for me?" I say
It never calls me when I'm down
Love never wanted me
But I took it anyway
Put your ear to the speaker
And choose love or sympathy
But never both, no
To the "love", I left my conscience pressed
Through the keyhole I watched you dress
Kiss and tell
Loose lips sink ships
To the "love", I left my conscience pressed
Through the keyholes I watched you dress
Kiss and tell
Loose lips sink ships
To the "love", I left my conscience pressed
Through the keyholes I watched you dress
Kiss and tell
(Loose lips sink ships)
To the "love", I left my conscience pressed
Between the pages of the Bible in the drawer
"What did it ever do for me?" I say
I wrote a goodbye note
In lipstick on your arm when you passed out
I couldn't bring myself to call
Except to call it quits
Best friends
Ex-friends till the end
Better off as lovers
And not the other way around
Racing through the city.
Windows down in the back of
Yellow-checkered cars
You're wrong
Are we all wrong?
You're wrong
Are we all wrong?
This city says
Come hell or high water
When I'm feeling hot and wet
I can't commit to a thing
Be it heart or hospital
Best friends
Ex-friends till the end
Better off as lovers
And not the other way around
Racing through the city
Windows down in the back of
Yellow-checkered cars
You're wrong
Are we all wrong?
You're wrong
Are we all wrong?
The tombstones were waiting
They were half-engraved
They knew it was over
Just didn't know the date
And I cast a spell over the west to make you think of me
The same way I think of you
This is a love song in my own way
Happily ever after below the waist
Best friends
Ex-friends till the end
Better off as lovers
Racing through the city
Windows down in the back of
Yellow checkered cars
You're wrong
Are we all wrong?
You're wrong
Are we all wrong?
Best friends
Ex-friends till the end
Better off as lovers
And not the other way around
Ex-friends till the end
Better off as lovers
Mr. Sandman showing his beam
When he walks into the room the walls lean in to listen
Surfed out brain waves flick back and forth
Like old headlights sniffing model glue again
Head like a steel trap
Wish I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn', t I didn't, I didn't
I don't just want to be a footnote in someone else's happiness
Does your husband know the way
That the sunshine gleams from your wedding band?
Does he know the way?
Does he know the way
Of the crickets that would convince me to call it a night?
But I will never end up like him
Behind my back I already am
Keep a calendar, this way you will always know
The last time you came through
Oh, darling, I know what you're going through
The last time you came through
Oh, darling
Oh, darling
Oh, darling
Tempest in a teacup, get unique
Peroxide princes shine like shark teeth
It's a sign
It's a sign (it's a sign)
It's a sign-what if you peaked early?
Does your husband know the way
That the sunshine gleams from your wedding band?
Does he know the way?
Does he know the way
Of the crickets that would convince me to call it a night?
Does he?
Does he know the way I worship our love?
Does your husband know the way
That the sunshine gleams from your wedding band?
But I will never end up like him
Behind my back I already am
Keep a calendar, this way you will always know
The last time you came through
Oh, darling, I know what you're going through
The last time you came through
Oh, darling
Oh, darling
Oh, darling
Does your husband know?
Does your husband know?
Does your husband know?
Does he know, does he know, does he know? Oh, oh, oh
But I will never end up like him
Behind my back I already am
Keep a calendar, this way you will always know
The last time you came through
Oh, darling, I know what you're going through
The last time you came through
Oh, darling, I know what you're going through
I just want to be better than your
Your head's only medicine
I just want to be better than your
Your head's only medicine
A downward spiral just a pirouette
Getting worse 'til there's nothing left
What good comes of something
When I'm just the ghost of nothing, nothing?
And I'm just the man on the balcony
Singing "nobody will ever remember me"
Rejoice, rejoice and fall to your knees
Lunatic of a God or a God of a lunatic
Oh, their faces are dancing
They're dancing 'til, 'til they can't stand it
A composer but never composed
Singing the symphonies of the overdosed
A composer but never composed
Singing "I only want what I can't have"
"I only want what I can't have"
Heralded as a king before I had a birthday
With double digits
Fit the crown to my head but I was only a kid
Yeah, I was only a kid
Hey, I'm just the man on the balcony
Singing "nobody will ever remember me"
Rejoice, rejoice and fall to your knees
Oh, lunatic of a God or a God of a lunatic
Oh, their faces are dancing
They're dancing 'til, 'til they can't stand it
A composer but never composed
Singing the symphonies of the overdosed
A composer but never composed
Singing "I only want what I can't have"
"I only want what I can't have"
"I only want what I can't have"
"I only want what I can't, I can't have"
I just want to be better than your
Your head's only medicine
I just want to be better than your
Your head's only medicine
I'm just the man on the balcony
Singing "nobody will ever remember me"
Rejoice, rejoice and fall to your knees
I'm just the man on the balcony
Singing nobody will ever remember me
Rejoice, rejoice and fall to your knees
Lunatic of a God or a God of a lunatic?
Oh, their faces are dancing
They're dancing 'til, 'til they can't stand it
A composer but never composed
Singing the symphonies of the overdosed
A composer but never composed
Singing "I only want what I can't have"
"I only want what I can't have"
"I only want what I can't have"
"I only want what I can't, I can't have"
You could've knocked me out with a (feather)
I know you've heard this all before but we're just hell's (neighbors)
Ohhh...
Why, why, why won't the world revolve around me?
Build my dreams, trees grow all over the streets
But I don't know much about classic cars(Cars)
But I've got a lot of friends stuck on classic coke (Coke)
Down, set, one, hut, hut, hike
Media please
Let's hear it for America's suitehearts!
But I must confess
I'm in love with my own sins
Let's hear it for America's suitehearts!
But I must confess
I'm in love with my own sins
You can bow and pretend
That you don't, don't know you're a legend, ohhh
Time, time, time hasn't told anyone else yet
(I'm sorry I just) Let my love loose again
Oh, I don't know much about classic cars (Cars)
But I've got a lot of friends stuck on classic coke (Coke)
Down, set, one, hut, hut, hike
Media please
Let's hear it for America's suitehearts!
But I must confess
I'm in love with my own sins
Let's hear it for America's suitehearts!
But I must confess
I'm in love with my own sins...
You could have knocked me out with a (feather)
I know you've heard this all before
Let's hear it for America's suitehearts!
But I must confess
I'm in love with my own sins
Let's hear it for America's suitehearts!
But I must confess (I must confess)
I'm in love with my own sins (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Let's hear it, oh let's hear it
Let's hear it, oh let's
Suitehearts!
(Suitehearts!)
Do you do, do you remember
When we drove, we drove, drove through the night
And we danced, we danced
To Rancid, and we danced, we danced
And I confessed, confessed to you
Riding shotgun underneath the purple skies
And we danced, we danced
With windows down, and we danced, we danced
You were the song stuck in my head
Every song I've ever loved
Played again and again and again
And you can get what you want but it's never enough
And I'll spin for you like your favorite records used to
And I'll spin for you like your favorite records used to
And I can't, I can't, I can't remember
Just how to forget, forget the way that we danced
We danced, to Danzig and we danced, we danced
And when you asked, you asked me how I'm doing
Like you know, you know how much better off I am
And when we danced, we danced, with windows down
And we danced, we danced
You were the song stuck in my head
Every song I've ever loved
Played again and again and again
And you can get what you want but it's never enough
And I'll spin for you like your favorite records used to
And I'll spin for you like your favorite records used to
I'll spin, I'll spin, I'll spin, I'll spin
For you, for you, for you, for you, for yeah...
Last year's wishes
Are this year's apologies
Every last time I come home
I take my last chance
To burn a bridge or two
I only keep myself this sick in the head
Cause I know how the words get you
We're the new face of failure
Prettier and younger but not any better off
Bulletproof and loneliness
At best, at best
Me and you
Setting in our honeymoon
If I woke up next to you
If I woke up next to you
Me and you
Setting in our honeymoon
If I woke up next to you
If I woke up next to you
Collect the bad habits
That you couldn't bare to keep
Out of the woods but I love
A tree I used to lay beneath
Kissed, tear-stained and vain
From a sour bottle baby girl
With eyes the size of baby worlds
We're the new face of failure
Prettier and younger but not any better off
Bulletproof and loneliness
At best, at best
Me and you
Setting in our honeymoon
If I woke up next to you
If I woke up next to you
Me and you
Setting in our honeymoon
If I woke up next to you
If I woke up next to you
Me and you
Setting in our honeymoon
If I woke up next to you
If I woke up next to you
Me and you
Setting in our honeymoon
If I woke up next to you
If I woke up next to you
The best way
To make it through
With hearts and wrists in tact
Is to realize
Two outta three ain't bad
Ain't bad
Me and you
Setting in our honeymoon
If I woke up next to you
If I woke up next to you
Me and you
(Honeymoon)
Setting in our honeymoon
(In a honeymoon)
Me and you
Setting in our honeymoon
If I woke up next to you
If I woke up next to you
Me and you
Setting in our honeymoon
If I woke up next to you
If I woke up next to you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Be careful making wishes in the dark, dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the mean, mean time
I'm just dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the de-details with the devil
So now the world can never get me on my level
I just got to get you out of the cage
I'm a young lover's rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite
My songs know what you did in the dark
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
In the dark, dark
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
In the dark, dark
All the writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just died
I've got the scars from tomorrow and
I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me, me
A constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love, then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides
My childhood spat back out the monster that you see
My songs know what you did in the dark
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
In the dark, dark
In the dark, dark
My songs know what you did in the dark
(My songs know what you did in the dark)
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
In the dark, dark
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
In the dark, dark
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Here we go again
Welcome to the demolition derby that is my heart
I'm only here to crash alive, it was never alright from the start?
Sometimes I feel like the whole world is after me
I'm just the best lookin' pony in the glue factory
But out of every pretty pretty miscalculation
You have got to be my all-time favorite
Love, sex, death
Till there's nothing left
Love, sex, death
Till there's nothing left
Nothing left
But out of every pretty pretty miscalculation
You have got to be my all-time favorite
Love, sex, death
Till there's nothing left
Love, sex, death
Till there's nothing left
[Intro]
Oh na na na na na na na na
[Verse 1]
I never really feel a thing
I'm just kinda too frozen
You were the only one
That even kinda came close
I just pinch myself
No longer comatose
I woke up, no luck
I woke up, no luck
[Pre-Chorus]
And when your stitch comes loose
I wanna sleep on every piece of fuzz
And stuffing that comes out of you, you
I took too many hits off this memory
I need to come down
[Chorus]
An-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
So hold me tight
Hold me tight, or don't
Oh n-n-no, no this isn't how our story ends
So hold me tight
Hold me tight, or don't
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na
[Verse 2]
I got too high again
Realized I can't not be with you
Or be just your friend
I love you to death
But I just can't, I just can't pretend
We weren't lovers first
Confidants but never friends
Were we ever friends?
[Pre-Chorus]
But when your stitch comes loose
I wanna sleep on every piece of fuzz
And stuffing that comes out of you, you
I took too many hits off this memory
I need to come down
[Chorus]
An-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
So hold me tight
Hold me tight, or don't
Oh n-n-no, no this isn't how our story ends
So hold me tight
Hold me tight, or don't
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na
Hold me tight, or don't
[Bridge]
'Cause I'm past the limits
The distance between us
It sharpens me like a knife
Past the limits
The distance between us
It sharpens me like a knife
[Chorus]
An-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
So hold me tight
Hold me tight, or don't
I'm pretty sure that this isn't how our story ends
So hold me tight
Hold me tight
Hold me tight, or don't
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na
Wishes bounce me weightless
The infrared scope on pointlessness
The bulls are sedated and this fight's fixed
Don't feel bad for the suicidal cats
Gotta kill themselves 9 times before they get it right
The P.A. system keeps my heart, heart beating tonight
Oh, hell, yes, I'm a nervous wreck
Oh, hell, yes, the drugs just make me reset
Knock once for the father
Twice for the son
Three times for the holy ghost
Come on in the water's warm
Come on like a sugar cube but with a kick in the head
Like putting wings on lead
Your eyes are blocking my starlight
I'm the last of my kind
(And that's all that should matter to you)
Follow the disorganized religion of my head
And we'll never get through customs
Let's just take off again instead
Got my degree in the gutter
My heart broken in dorms of the Ivy League
Oh, hell, yes, I'm a nervous wreck
Oh, hell, yes, the drugs just make me reset
Knock once for the father
Twice for the son
Three times for the holy ghost
Knock once for the father
Twice for the son
Three times for the holy ghost
I'm a nervous wreck, I'm a nervous wreck
I'm a nervous wreck
I'm a n-n-nervous wreck
I'm a nervous wreck, I'm a nervous wreck
(Oh, hell, yes)
The drugs just make me reset(The drugs just make me reset)
Knock once for the father(Knock once for the father)
Twice for the son
Three times(Three times) for the holy ghost
Three times (Three times) for the holy ghost
Three times (Three times) for the holy ghost
Na na na na na, na na na na na na
I'm here to collect your hearts
It's the only reason that I sing
I don't believe a word you say but I can't stop listening
This the story of how they met
Her picture was on the back of a pack of cigarettes
And when she touches him, he turned ruby red
A story that they'll never forget, never forget
And all the boys are smoking menthols, girls are getting backrubs
I will drift to you if you make yourself shake fast enough
My old aches become new again
My old friends become ex's again
Woah, where did the party go?
We're ending it on the phone
I'm not gonna go home alone
Woah, where did the party go?
Na na na na na, na na na na na na
Yea
I know I expect too much
And not enough all at once
You know I only wanted fun then you got me all fucked up on love
I look for your name on the ouija board
And you're naked magic, oh dear lord
You and me are the difference between real love and the love on T.V.,
Love on T.V.
And all the boys are smoking menthols, girls are getting backrubs
I will drift to you if you make yourself shake fast enough
My old aches become new again
My old friends become ex's again, yea
Woah, where did the party go?
We're ending it on the phone
I'm not gonna go home alone
Woah, where did the party go?
Na na na na na, na na na na na na
We were the kids who screamed, "We weren't the same" in sweaty rooms
Now, we're doomed to organizing walk-in closets like tombs
Silent film stars stuck in taling cinema life
So let's fade away together one dream at a time
Na na na na na, na na na na na na
Woah, where did the party go?
We're ending it on the phone
I'm not gonna go home alone
Woah, where did the party go?
Na na na na na, na na na na na na
You and I were, you and I were fire.
You and I were, you and I were fire.
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fire
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom, too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned light my way back home
On the fourth of July
I'll be as honest as you let me
I miss your early morning company
If you get me
You are my favorite "what if"
You are my best "I'll never know"
And I'm starting to forget
Just what summer ever meant to you
What did it ever mean to you?
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean any of it
I just got too lonely, lonely, whoa
In between being young and being right
You were my Versailles at night
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom, too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned light my way back home
On the fourth of July
My 9 to 5 is cutting open old scars
Again and again 'til I'm stuck in your head
Had my doubts, but I let them out
You are the drought
And I'm the holy water you have been without
And all my thoughts of you
They could heat or cool the room
And no, don't tell me you're crying
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean any of it
I just got too lonely, lonely, whoa
In between being young and being right
You were my Versailles at night
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom, too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned light my way back home
On the fourth of July
I wish I'd known how much you loved me
I wish I cared enough to know
I'm sorry every song's about you
The torture of small talk with someone you used to love
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom, too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned light my way back home
On the fourth of July
Last year's wishes
Are this year's apologies
Every last time I come home
I take my last chance
To burn a bridge or two
I only keep myself this sick in the head
Cause I know how the words get you (off)
We're the new face of failure
Prettier and younger but not any better off
Bullet proof loneliness
At best, at best
Me and you
Setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you
If I woke up next to you
Me and you
Setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you
If I woke up next to you
Collect the bad habits
That you couldn't bare to keep
Out of the woods but I love
A tree I used to lay beneath
Kissed teeth stained red
From a sour bottle baby girl
With eyes the size of baby worlds
We're the new face of failure
Prettier and younger but not any better off
Bullet proof loneliness
At best, at best
Me and you
Setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you
If I woke up next to you
Me and you
Setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you
If I woke up next to you
Me and you
Setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you
If I woke up next to you
Me and you
Setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you
If I woke up next to you
The best way
To make it through
With hearts and wrists intact
Is to realize
Two out of three ain't bad
Ain't bad
Me and you
Setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you
If I woke up next to you
Me and you
(Honeymoon)
Setting in a honeymoon
Me and you
Setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you
If I woke up next to you
Me and you
Setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you
(Honeymoon)
Clap until you hands hurt,
standing ovations or boo-boo-boos
Wa-watch us until we blur,
Walk off into the sunset
Tell Rock'n'Roll
I'm alone again
I want to pick the mid west home again
Your time has passed
They say never means never
So the fast dance won't last
Clap until you hands hurt,
Standing ovations or boo-boo-boos
Wa-watch us until we blur
Walk off into the sunset
Tell Rock'n'Roll
I'm alone again
I want to pick the mid west home again
Your time has passed
They say never means never
So the fast dance won't last,
But never means forever
Never means forever
ALPHAdog and oh, OMEGAlomaniac
Eh, eh, eh-eh, eh, eh
ALPHAdog and oh OMEGA-MEGA-lo
Welcome to the new administration
I can almost see the wizard through the curtains
ALPHAdog and oh, OMEGAlomaniac
Eh, eh,
Eh-eh eh eh
Coming in unannounced, drag my nails on the tile
I just follow your scent, you can just follow my smile
All of your flaws are aligned with this mood of mine
Cutting me to the bone, nothing left to leave behind
You ought to keep me concealed just like I was a weapon
I didn't come for a fight but I will fight til the ending
This will not be a battle, might not turn out okay
You know you look so Seattle but you feel so LA
And I love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, yeah
It's irresistible, yeah
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
You hurt me one time then I love it
You hurt me two times then fuck it
When my pockets was old, you was ready to go
Now my pockets on so you got relationship goals
When you laid your eyes on me, you was excited
And I was the fuel to your flame, I ignited
Then you stole my heart, that's the heart of a lion
So fuck all this shit, let's just start up a riot
This world is so cold that's why I bought a fur coat
My house is on a island, you gon need a need a boat
And I swim with the sharks til the other side
And I feed on the [?] outside
I came from the bottom, are you from the bottom?
If you ever had problems and you started from the bottom, holler
And I love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, yeah
It's irresistible, yeah
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
Hey, talk somethin' Takeoff
See I would toss her salad [?] rock and never fold
I'ma tell him, my son, everythin' glitter it ain't gold
I showed you shit that a basic bitch, she'll never know
And took you places a basic bitch, she'll never go
Now you running around showing off your camel toe
Got you singing a sad song, call you Satchmo
Then go home and tell your momma about us and we fuss
She called my phone and question me like we love her, she bugging
I think it's better that we end our days and split our ways
Know you like them red bottles, put you right back in them Js
When we go shopping we cop it right then and never wait
When we depart, go put that merchandise on layaway
I tried to show you expensive shit and luxury living
Breaking news, break your heart when you see me on television
Takeoff
You're second hand smoke, second hand smoke
I breathe you in, but honey I don't know what you're doing to me
Mon chéri but the truth catches up with us eventually
Try to say live, live and let live
But I'm no good, good at lip service
Except when they're yours, mi amor
I'm coming for you and I'm making war
And I still love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, yeah
It's irresistible, yeah
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I'm a stitch away from making it
And a scar away from falling apart, apart
Blood cells pixelate
And eyes dilate
And the full moon pills got me out on the street at night
Cut it loose
Watch you work the room
Cut it loose
Watch you work the room
Cut it loose
Watch you work the room
Cut it loose
Watch you work the room
Oh
Put love on hold,
Young Hollywood is on the other line
Her nose runs ruby red, deaths in a double bed
Singing songs that could only catch the ear of the desperate
Cut it loose
Watch you work the room
Cut it loose
Watch you work the room
Cut it loose
Watch you work the room
Cut it loose
I'm a stitch away from making it
And a scar away from falling apart, apart
Blood cells pixelate
And eyes dilate
Kiss away young thrills and kills on the mouths of all my friends
Cut it loose
Watch you work the room
Loose
Watch you work the room
Cut it loose
(Watch you work the room)
I'm a stitch away...
There's a room in a hotel in New York City
That shares our fate and deserves our pity
I don't want to remember it all
The promises I made if you just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
I just need enough of you to dull the pain
Just to get me through the night 'til we're twins again
'Til we're stripped down to our skeletons again
'Til we're saints just swimming in our sins again
And there's a jet black crow droning on and on and on
Up above our heads droning on and on and on
Keep making trouble 'til find what you love
I need a new partner in crime and you, you shrug
That there's a room in a hotel in New York City
That shares our fate and deserves our pity
I don't want to remember it all
The promises I made if you just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
A birth and a death on the same day
And honey I only appeared so I can fade away
I wanna throw my hands in the air and scream
And I could just die laughing on your spiral of shame
And there's a jet black crow droning on and on and on
Up above our heads droning on and on and on
Hit it never quit it I have been through the wreck
But I can string enough to show my face in the light of day
There's a room in a hotel in New York City
That shares our fate and deserves our pity
I don't want to remember it all
The promises I made if you just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
There's a room in a hotel in New York City
That shares our fate and deserves our pity
I don't want to remember it all
The promises I made if you just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
I just need enough of you to dull the pain
Just to get me through the night 'til we're twins again
'Til we're stripped down to our skeletons again
'Til we're saints just swimming in our sins again
And there's a jet black crow droning on and on and on
Up above our heads droning on and on and on
Keep making trouble 'til find what you love
I need a new partner in crime and you, you shrug
That there's a room in a hotel in New York City
That shares our fate and deserves our pity
I don't want to remember it all
The promises I made if you just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
A birth and a death on the same day
And honey I only appeared so I can fade away
I wanna throw my hands in the air and scream
And I could just die laughing on your spiral of shame
And there's a jet black crow droning on and on and on
Up above our heads droning on and on and on
Hit it never quit it I have been through the wreck

Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Joke me something awful
Just like kisses on the necks of best friends
We're the kids who feel like dead ends.
And I want to be known for my hits, not just my misses
I took the shot and didn't even come close
At trust, and love, and hope
And the poets are just kids who didn't make it
And never had it at all
And the record won't stop skipping
And the lies just won't stop slipping
And besides my reputation's on the line
We can fake it for the airwaves
Force our smiles, baby, half dead
From comparing myself to everyone else around me
Please put the doctor on the phone
'Cause I'm not making any sense
Blame everyone but me for this mess
And my back has been breaking from this heavy heart
We never seemed so far
I'm hopelessly hopeful
You're just hopeless enough
But we never had it at all
And the record won't stop skipping
And the lies just won't stop slipping
And besides my reputation's on the line
We can fake it for the airwaves
Force our smiles, baby, half dead
From comparing myself to everyone else around me
To everyone else around me
Everyone else around me
Everyone else around me
Drink down that gin and kerosene
And come, spit on bridges with me
Just to keep us warm
Light a match to leave me be
Light a match to leave me be!
I keep my jealousy close, 'cause, it's all mine
And if you say this makes you happy
Then I'm not the only one lying
Keep quiet, nothing comes as easy as you
Can I lay in your bed all day?
I'll be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake
Hand behind this pen relives a failure everyday
Keep quiet, nothing comes as easy as you
Can I lay in your bed all day?
I'll be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake
Hand behind this pen relives a failure everyday
I keep my jealousy close 'cause it's all mine
And if you say this makes you happy
Then I'm not the only one lying
Drink down that gin and kerosene
And come, spit on bridges with me
Just to keep us warm
Light a match to leave me be
Light a match to leave me
Keep quiet, nothing comes as easy as you
Can I lay in your bed all day?
I'll be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake
Hand behind this pen relives a failure everyday
Keep quiet, nothing comes as easy as you
Can I lay in your bed all day?
I'll be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake
Hand behind this pen relives a failure everyday
So wear me like a locket around your throat
I'll weigh you down, I'll watch you choke
You look so good in blue, you look so good in blue
So wear me like a locket around your throat
I'll weigh you down, I'll watch you choke
You look so good in blue, you look so good in blue
So wear me like a locket around your throat
I'll weigh you down, I'll watch you choke
You look so good in blue, you look so good in blue
Keep quiet, nothing comes as easy as you
Can I lay in your bed all day?
I'll be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake
Hand behind this pen relives a failure everyday
Keep quiet, nothing comes as easy as you
Can I lay in your bed all day?
I'll be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake
Hand behind this pen relives a failure everyday
Keep quiet, nothing comes as easy as you
Can I lay in your bed all day?
I'll be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake
Hand behind this pen relives a failure everyday.
{Yeah, what you critics said would never happen
We dedicate this album to anybody people said couldn't make it
To the fans that held us down 'til everybody came around
Welcome, it's here}
That summer we took threes across the board
But by fall we were a cover story
"Now in stores"
Make us poster boys for your scene
But we are not making an acceptance speech
I have found the safest place to keep all our old mistakes
Every dot-com's refreshing for a journal update
So long live the car-crash hearts
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life
Fix me in 45
So long live the car-crash hearts
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life
Fix me in 45
I can take your problems away
With a nod and a wave of my hand
'Cause that's just the kind of boy that I am
The only thing I haven't done yet is die
And it's me and my plus one at the afterlife
Crowds are won and lost and won again
But all our hearts beat for the diehards
So long live the car-crash hearts
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life
And fix me in 45
So long live the car-crash hearts
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life
And fix me in 45
Long live the car-crash hearts
Long live the car-crash hearts
(Long live the car-crash hearts)
Long live the car-crash hearts
Long live the car-crash hearts
Long live the car-crash hearts
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life
Fix me in 45
{Young! F-O-B! Let's go}

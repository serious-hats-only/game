Oh-ho-ho-ho, aye-yi-yi-yi-yi, ooh You may find yourself living in a shotgun shack
And you may find yourself in another part of the world
And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile
You may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife
You may ask yourself, "Well, how did I get here?" Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground And you may ask yourself, "How do I work this?"
And you may ask yourself, "Where is that large automobile?"
And you may tell yourself, "This is not my beautiful house"
And you may tell yourself, "This is not my beautiful wife" Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground Same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was Water dissolving and water removing
There is water at the bottom of the ocean
Under the water, carry the water
Remove the water from the bottom of the ocean
Water dissolving and water removing Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, into the silent water
Under the rocks and stones, there is water underground Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Leting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground You may ask yourself, "What is that beautiful house?"
You may ask yourself, "Where does that highway go to?"
You may ask yourself, "Am I right, am I wrong?"
You may say to yourself, "My God! What have I done?" Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, into the silent water
Under the rocks and stones, there is water underground Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, look where my hand was Time isn't holding up, time isn't after us
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, hey let's all twist our thumbs
Here comes the twister Letting the days go by
Letting the days go by
Once in a lifetime
Let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by Home is where I want to be
Pick me up and turn me round
I feel numb, burn with a weak heart
I guess I must be having fun
The less we say about it the better
Make it up as we go along
Feet on the ground
Head in the sky
It's ok I know nothing's wrong...nothing Hi yo I got plenty of time
Hi yo you got light in your eyes
And you're standing here beside me
I love the passing of time
Never for money
Always for love
Cover up + say goodnight...say goodnight Home, is where I want to be
But I guess I'm already there
I come home, she lifted up her wings
Guess that this must be the place
I can't tell one from another
Did I find you, or you find me?
There was a time before we were born
If someone asks, this where I'll be where I'll be Hi yo we drift in and out
Hi yo sing into my mouth
Out of all tose kinds of people
You got a face with a view
I'm just an animal looking for a home
Share the same space for a minute or two
And you love me till my heart stops
Love me till I'm dead
Eyes that light up, eyes look through you
Cover up the blank spots
Hit me on the head ah ooh Well, we know where we're goin'
But we don't know where we've been
And we know what we're knowin'
But we can't say what we've seen And we're not little children
And we know what we want
And the future is certain
Give us time to work it out We're on a road to nowhere
Come on inside
Takin' that ride to nowhere
We'll take that ride I'm feelin' okay this mornin'
And you know
We're on a road to paradise
Here we go, here we go We're on a ride to nowhere
Come on inside
Takin' that ride to nowhere
We'll take that ride Maybe you wonder where you are
I don't care
Here is where time is on our side
Take you there, take you there We're on a road to nowhere
We're on a road to nowhere
We're on a road to nowhere There's a city in my mind
Come along and take that ride
And it's all right, baby it's all right And it's very far away
But it's growing day by day
And it's all right, baby it's all right Would you like to come along?
And you could help me sing this song
And it's all right, baby it's all right They can tell you what to do
But they'll make a fool of you
And it's all right, baby it's all right There's a city in my mind
Come along and take that ride
And it's all right, baby it's all right And it's very far away
But it's growing day by day
And it's all right, baby it's all right Would you like to come along?
You could help me sing this song
And it's all right, baby it's all right They can tell you what to do
But they'll make a fool of you
And it's all right, baby it's all right We're on a road to nowhere
We're on a road to nowhere
We're on a road to nowhere
We're on a road to nowhere What about the time?
You were rollin' over
Fall on your face
You must be having fun
Walk lightly
Think of a time
You'd best believe
This think is real Put away that gun
This part is simple
Try to recognize
What is in you mind
God help us
Help us loose our minds
These slippery people
Help us understand What's the matter with him? He's alright
How do you know? The lord won't mind
Don't play no games, he's alright
Love from the bottom to the top
Turn like a wheel, he's alright
See for yourself, the Lord won't mind
We're gonna move right now
Turn like a wheel inside a wheel I remember when
Sittin' in the tub
Pulled out the plug
The water was runnin' out
Cool down
Stop actin' crazy
They're gonna leave
And we'll be on our own Seven times five
They were living creatures
Watch 'em come to life
Right before your eyes
Backslidin'
How do you do?
These slippery people
Gonna see you through What's the matter with him? He's alright
How do you know? The lord won't mind
Don't play no games, he's alright
Love from the bottom to the top
Turn like a wheel, he's alright
See for yourself, the Lord won't mind
We're gonna move right now
Turn like a wheel inside a wheel What's the matter with him? He's alright
How do you know? The lord won't mind

Love from the bottom to the top
Turn like a wheel, he's alright
See for yourself, the Lord won't mind
We're gonna move right now
Turn like a wheel inside a wheel He's alright
Love from the bottom
Alright
Love from the bottom to the top
Alright
The love from the bottom
Right now
Turn like a wheel inside a wheel Get them out
Ah Watch out, you might get what you're after
Cool babies, strange but not a stranger
I'm an ordinary guy
Burning down the house Hold tight, wait 'til the party's over
Hold tight, we're in for nasty weather
There has, got to be a way
Burning down the house Here's your ticket pack your bags
Time for jumpin' overboard
Transportation isn't here
Close enough but not too far,
Maybe you know where you are
Fightin' fire with fire, huah All wet, hey you might need a raincoat
Shakedown, dreams walking in broad daylight
Three hundred, sixty five degrees
Burning down the house It was once upon a place sometimes, I listen to myself
Gonna come in first place
People on their way to work say baby what did you expect
Gonna burst into flame
Go ahead Burning down the house
My house, is out of the ordinary
That's right, don't want to hurt nobody
Some things, sure can sweep me off my feet
Burning down the house No visible means of support and you have not seen nothin' yet
Everything's stuck together
I don't know what you expect staring into the TV set
Fightin' fire with fire, huah Yea
Burning down the house
Burning down the house
Burning down the house Home is where I want to be
Pick me up and turn me round
I feel numb, burn with a weak heart
I guess I must be having fun
The less we say about it the better

All the changes you put me through
Take my money, my cigarettes
I haven't seen the worst of it yet
And I wanna know, can you tell me?
I'd love to stay Take me to the river
Drop me in the water
Take me to the river
Dip me in the water, washing me down
Washing me down I don't know why you treat me so bad
Think of all the things we could have had
Love is a notion that I can't forget
My sweet sixteen I would never regret
I wanna know can you tell me
I'd love to stay Take me to the river
Drop me in the water
Take me to the river
Dip me in the water, washing me down Washing me
Hold me, squeeze me
Love me, tease me

'Til I can't, I can't take no more Take me to the river
Drop me in the water
Dip me in the water
Drop me to the river
Dip me in the water
Drop me in the river
Push me in the water, washing me down
Washing me down I don't know why I love you like I do
All the trouble you put me through
Sixteen candles blown on my wall
And am I the biggest fool of them all
I wanna know, can you tell me?
I'd love to stay Take me to the river
Drop me in the water
Dip me in the water
Drop me to the river
Dip me in the water
Drop me in the river
Drop me in the water, washing me down
Washing me down Hello again
Yes, indeed, my friend
I can tell
Goin' together again
I could be right
I could be wrong
I feel nice when I sing this song
And I don't mind
Whatever happens is fine Baby likes to keep on playing
What do I know, what do I know?
Wilder than the place we live in
I'll take you there, I'll take you there
I don't mind some slight disorder
Pull up the roots, pull up the roots
I know every living creature
Pull up the roots, pull up the roots And I know you
I understand what you do
Yes indeed
I put the hat on my head
Come outta your mess
Bring yourself in
I feel nice when I start to sing
And I can see
That everyone else is like me Towns that disappeared completely
Pull up the roots, pull up the roots
Miles and miles of endless highway
Pull up the roots, pull up the roots
Colored lights and shiny curtains
I'll take you there, I'll take you there
Everything has been forgiven
Pull up the roots, pull up the roots Well I have a good time
When I go out of my mind
And it's a wonderful place
And I can't wait to be there
I hear beautiful sounds
Comin' outta the ground
Gonna take us a while
But we'll go hundreds of times Baby likes to keep on playing
What do you know, what do you know?
Wilder than the place we live in
I'll take you there, I'll take you there
And I don't mind some slight disorder
Pull up the roots, pull up the roots
And no more time for talkin' it over
Pull up the roots, pull up the roots Well I have a good time
When I go out of my mind
And it's a wonderful place
And I can't wait to be there
And I hear beautiful sounds
Comin' outta the ground
Someone musta been high
But I guess it's all right Heard of a van that is loaded with weapons
Packed up and ready to go
Heard of some grave sites out by the highway
A place where nobody knows
The sound of gunfire off in the distance
I'm getting used to it now
Lived in a brownstone, I lived in the ghetto
I've lived all over this town This ain't no party, this ain't no disco
This ain't no fooling around
No time for dancing, or lovey dovey
I ain't got time for that now Transmit the message to the receiver
Hope for an answer some day
I got three passports, couple of visas
Don't even know my real name
High on a hillside trucks are loading
Everything's ready to roll
I sleep in the daytime, I work in the nightime
I might not ever get home This ain't no party, this ain't no disco
This ain't no fooling around
This ain't no mudd club, or C.B.G.B.
I ain't got time for that now This ain't no party, this ain't no disco
This ain't no fooling around
No time for dancing, or lovey dovey
I ain't got time for that now Heard about houston? heard about detroit?
Heard about pittsburgh, PA?
You oughta know not to stand by the window
Somebody might see you up there
I got some groceries, some peanut butter
To last a couple of days
But I ain't got no speakers, ain't got no headphones
Ain't got no records to play Why stay in college? why go to night school?
Gonna be different this time?
Can't write a letter, can't send a postcard
I can't write nothing at all
This ain't no party, this ain't no disco
This ain't no fooling around
I'd love you hold you, I'd like to kiss you
I ain't got no time for that now Trouble in transit, got through the roadblock
We blended in with the crowd
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines
I know that ain't allowed
We dress like students, we dress like housewives
Or in a suit and a tie
I changed my hairstyle so many times now
Don't know what I look like
You make me shiver, I feel so tender
We make a pretty good team
Don't get exhausted, I'll do some driving
You ought to get you some sleep
Burned all my notebooks, what good are notebooks?
They won't help me survive
My chest is aching, burns like a furnace
The burning keeps me alive Everyone is trying to get to the bar
The name of the bar, the bar is called Heaven
The band in Heaven, they play my favorite song
They play it once again, they play it all night long Heaven
Heaven is a place
A place where nothing
Nothing ever happens
Heaven
Heaven is a place
A place where nothing
Nothing ever happens There is a party, everyone is there
Everyone will leave at exactly the same time
It's hard to imagine that nothing at all
Could be so exciting, could be so much fun Yeah, heaven
Heaven is a place
A place where nothing
Nothing ever happens
Yeah, heaven
Heaven is a place
A place where nothing
Nothing ever happens And when this kiss is over, it will start again
Will not be any different, will be exactly the same
It's hard to imagine that nothing at all
Could be so exciting, could be this much fun Yeah, heaven
Heaven is a place
A place where nothing
Nothing ever happens
Heaven
Heaven is a place
A place where nothing
Nothing ever happens Hey! And she was lying in the grass
And she could hear the highway breathing
And she could see a nearby factory
She's making sure she is not dreaming See the lights of a neighbor's house
Now she's starting to rise
Take a minute to concentrate
And she opens up her eyes The world was moving she was right there with it and she was
The world was moving she was floating above it and she was
And she was And she was drifting through the backyard
And she was taking off her dress
And she was moving very slowly
Rising up above the earth Moving into the universe
And she's drifting this way and that
Not touching the ground at all
And she's up above the yard The world was moving, she was right there with it and she was
(Hey, hey)
The world was moving, she was floating above it and she was
(Hey, hey, hey) She was proud about it, no doubt about it
She isn't sure about what she's done
No time to think about what to tell him
No time to think about what she's done
And she was
(Hey hey, hey hey, hey) And she was looking at herself
And things were looking like a movie
She had a pleasant elevation
She's moving out in all directions
Oh, oh oh Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey The world was moving, she was right there with it and she was
(Hey, woo hoo)
The world was moving, she was floating above it and she was
(Hey, hey) Joining the world of missing persons and she was
Missing enough to feel all right and she was And she was
And she was
And she was... 
 Mommy had
A little baby
There he is
Fast asleep
He's just
A little plaything

Little baby
Little pee pee
Little toes

The kitchen floor Baby, baby, please, let me hold him

Sister, sister, he's just a plaything
We wanna make him stay up all night, yeah, we do See him drink
From a bottle

From a plate

Little smile
On his face
Don't cha love
The little baby?

Rock on all night long
All night long
All night long
All night long Ha! Who took the money?
Who took the money away?
Ha ha ha ha it's always showtime
Here at the edge of the stage
And I, I, I, wake up and wonder
What was the place, what was the name?
We wanna wait, but here we go again Ha! Takes over slowly
But doesn't last very long
Ha ha ha ha no need to worry
Everything's under control
O U T! But no hard feelings
What do you know? Take you away
We're being taken for a ride again I got a girlfriend that's better than that
She has the smoke in her eyes
She's coming up, going right through my heart
She's gonna give me surprise
I think it's right, better than this
I think you can if you like
I got a girlfriend with bows in her hair
And nothing is better than that (is it?) Oh! Down in the basement
We hear the sound of machines
Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha! Driving in circles
Come to my senses sometimes
Why, why, why, why start it over?
Nothing was lost, everything's free
I don't care how impossible it seems Somebody calls you but you cannot hear
Get closer to be far away
Only one look and that's all that it takes
Maybe that's all that we need
All that it takes, I'll bet it's right
All it takes, if it's right
I got a girlfriend that's better than that
And she goes wherever she likes (there she goes) I got a girlfriend that's better than that
Now everyone's getting involved
She's moving up going right through my heart
We might not ever get caught
Going right through (try to stay cool)
Going through, staying cool
I got a girlfriend she's better than that
And nothing is better than you I got a girlfriend that's better than this
But you don't remember at all
As we get older and stop making sense
You won't find her waiting long
Stop making sense, stop making sense
Stop making sense, making sense
I got a girlfriend shes's better than that
And nothing is better than this (is it?) Here we stand
Like an Adam and an Eve
Waterfalls
The Garden of Eden
Two fools in love
So beautiful and strong
The birds in the trees
Are smiling upon them
From the age of the dinosaurs
Cars have run on gasoline
Where, where have they gone?
Now, it's nothing but flowers There was a factory
Now, there are mountains and rivers
You got it, you got it
We caught a rattlesnake
Now, we got something for dinner
We got it, we got it
There was a shopping mall
Now, it's all covered with flowers
You've got it, you've got it
If this is paradise
I wish I had a lawnmower
You've got it, you've got it Years ago
I was an angry young man
I'd pretend
That I was a billboard
Standing tall
By the side of the road
I fell in love
With a beautiful highway
This used to be real estate
Now, it's only fields and trees
Where, where is the town?
Now, it's nothing but flowers The highways and cars
Were sacrificed for agriculture
I thought that we'd start over
But I guess I was wrong, hey Once there were parking lots
Now, it's a peaceful oasis
You got it, you got it
This was a Pizza Hut
Now, it's all covered with daisies
You got it, you got it
I miss the honky tonks
Dairy Queens and 7-Elevens
You got it, you got it
And as things fell apart
Nobody paid much attention
You got it, you got it I dream of cherry pies
Candy bars and chocolate chip cookies
You got it, you got it
We used to microwave
Now, we just eat nuts and berries
You got it, you got it
This was a discount store
Now, it's turned into a cornfield
You got it, you got it
Don't leave me stranded here
I can't get used to this lifestyle Take a look at these hands
Take a look at these hands
The hand speaks, the hand of a government man
Well I'm a tumbler born under punches, I'm so thin All I want is to breathe
(I'm too thin)
Won't you breathe with me?
Find a little space, so we move in-between
(In-between it)
And keep one step ahead, of yourself Don't you miss it, don't you miss it
Some of you people just about missed it
Last time to make plans
And I'm a tumbler, I'm a government man Never seen anything like that before
Falling bodies tumble 'cross the floor
(Well I'm a tumbler)
When you get to where you wanna be
(Thank you! Thank you!)
When you get to where you wanna be
(Well, don't even mention it) Oh, take a look at these hands, they're passing in-between us
Take a look at these hands
Take a look at these hands, you don't have to mention it
No thanks, I'm a government man And the heat goes on and the heat goes on
And the heat goes on and the heat goes on
And the heat goes on where the hand has been
And the heat goes on and the heat goes on And the heat goes on
(I got time)
And the heat goes on
And the heat goes on and the heat goes on
And the heat goes on, where the hand has been
And the heat goes on and the heat goes on I'm not a drowning man
And I'm not a burning building! I'm a tumbler
Drowning cannot hurt a man
Fire cannot hurt a man, not the government man All I want is to breathe
(Thank you, thank you)
Won't you breathe with me?
Find a little space so we move in-between
(I'm so thin)
And keep one step ahead of yourself
(I'm catching up with myself) All I want is to breathe
Won't you breathe with me?
(Hands of a government man)
Find a little space so we move in-between
And keep one step ahead of yourself
(Don't you miss it! Don't you miss it!) All I want is to breathe
Won't you breathe with me? Oh, oh, she's my neighbor, fill my cup
I'll bet you, baby, she can fill it up She put the sugar on my tongue
And she gimme, gimme, gimme some
Is she gonna put that sugar on my tongue?
Is she gonna gimme, gimme, gimme some? She'll put it right there on my tongue
Put it right there on my tongue Sweet sweet, lover lover
Never, never, never find another To put sugar on my tongue
Gimme, gimme, gimme some
Is she gonna put sugar on my tongue?
Is she gonna gimme gimme gimme some? She'll put it right there on my tongue
Put it right there on my tongue I've been waiting years and years
Finally I see that you appear
My friends are here and they ask of me
"Is this the time that we're gonna see her?" Put the sugar on your tongue
Is she gonna put sugar on my tongue?
Is she gonna put sugar on my tongue?
Is she gonna gimme, gimme some? She'll put it right there on my tongue
Put it right there on my tongue
She'll put sugar on my tongue "Damn that television... what a bad picture"
"Don't get upset, it's not a major disaster"
"There's nothing on tonight," he said, "I don't know what's the matter!"
"Nothing's ever on," she said, "so... I don't know why you bother." We've heard this little scene, we've heard it many times
People fighting over little things and wasting precious time
They might be better off... I think... the way it seems to me
Making up their own shows, which might be better than T.V. Judy's in the bedroom, inventing situations
Bob is on the street today, scouting up locations
They've enlisted all their family
They've enlisted all their friends
It helped save their relationship
And made it work again... Their show gets real high ratings, they think they have a hit
There might even be a spinoff, but they're not sure 'bout that
If they ever watch T.V. again, it'd be too soon for them
Bob never yells about the picture now, he's having too much fun Judy's in the bedroom, inventing situations
Bob is on the street today, scouting up locations
They've enlisted all their family
They've enlisted all their friends
It helped save their relationship
And made it work again... So think about this little scene, apply it to your life
If your work isn't what you love, then something isn't right
Just look at Bob and Judy, they're happy as can be
Inventing situations, putting them on T.V. Judy's in the bedroom, inventing situations
Bob is on the street today, he's having a vacation
They've enlisted all their family
They've enlisted all their friends
It helped save their relationship
And made it work again... Think of London, small city
Dark, dark in the daytime
People sleep, sleep in the daytime
If they want to, if they want to I'm checking them out, I'm checking them out
I got it figured out, I got it figured out
Good points some bad points
But it all works out, I'm a little freaked out
Find a city, find myself a city to live in
I will find a city, find myself a city to live in Lot of rich people in Birmingham
Lot of ghosts in a lot of houses
Look over there! Dry ice factory
Good place to get some thinking done I'm checking them out, I'm checking them out
I got it figured out, I got it figured out
Good points some bad points
But it all works out, I'm a little freaked out
Find a city, find myself a city to live in
I will find a city, find myself a city to live in I'm checking them out, I'm checking them out
I got it figured out, I got it figured out
Good points some bad points
But it all works out, sometimes I'm a little freaked out
Find a city, find myself a city to live in
I will find a city, find myself a city to live in I forget to mention, forget to mention Memphis
Home of Elvis and the ancient Greeks
Do I smell? I smell home cooking
It's only the river, it's only the river I'm checking them out, I'm checking them out
I got it figured out, I got it figured out
Good points some bad points
But it all works out, I'm a little freaked out
Find a city, find myself a city to live in
I will find a city, find myself a city to live in Find a city, find myself a city to live in
I will find a city, find myself a city to live in
... Okay! Pretty
What is brand new, exactly I think of you
You'll touch me in a minute
But that's not what I want to do We are two strangers
We might never have met
We can talk forever
I understand what you said But I'm not in love, what does it take to fall in love?
Do people really fall in love? You know it
Is there a time for this? Is this responsibility?
Girl time, boy time
Is that the difference between you and me? I won't ask any questions
Who needs to make a new start
I choose to believe you
I said before that I can't 'Cause I'm not in love, what does it take to fall in love?
Do people really fall in love? Feelings
Take it easy, baby
Don't let your feelings get in the way
I believe someday we'll live in a world without love I can answer your questions
If you won't twist what I say
Please respect my opinions
They will be respected someday But I don't need love, there'll come a day when we won't need love
I don't believe that we don't need love I'm mad and that's a fact
I found out animals don't help
Animals think they're pretty smart
Shit on the ground, see in the dark They wander around like a crazy dog
Make a mistake in the parking lot
Always bumping into things
Always let you down, down, down, down
Eh, eh, eh, eh Animals think they understand
Most of them are a big mistake
Animals want to change my life
I will ignore, I don't know such place They're never there when you need them
They're never there when you call them
They're never there when you need them
They're never there when you call them down
Down, down, down I know the animals are laughing at us
Don't even know what a joke is
I won't follow animal's advice
I don't care if they're laughing at us They're never there when you need them
They're never there when you call them
They're never there when you need them
They're never there when you call them down
Down, down
Eh, eh, eh They say they don't need money
They're living on nuts and berries
They say animals don't worry
They're living on nuts and berries You know animals are hairy?
They say animals don't worry
They think they know what's best
They're making a fool of us They ought to be more careful
They're setting a bad example
They say animals don't worry
They're living on nuts and berries They're setting a bad example
They ought to be more careful
You know animals are hairy?
They're living on nuts and berries They want to know what's best
They're making a fool of us
They ought to be more careful
They're setting a bad example They like to laugh at people
They're setting a bad example
They have untroubled lives
They think every thing's nice They say they don't need money
They say animals don't worry
They're living on nuts and berries
You know animals are hairy? They think they know what's best
They're making a fool of us
They like to laugh at people
They're making a bad example They say they don't need money
You know animals are hairy?
They're living on nuts and berries
They say they don't need money
They're setting a bad example Lost my shape
Trying to act casual
Can't stop
I might end up in the hospital
Changing my shape
I feel like an accident
They're back
To explain their experience Isn't it weird?
Looks too obscure to me
Wasting away
That was their policy I'm ready to leave
I push the fact in front of me
Facts lost
Yeah, facts are never what they seem to be
Nothing there
No information left of any kind
L-l-lifting my head
L-l-looking for the danger signs There was a line
There was a formula
Sharp as a knife
Facts cut a hole in us
There was a line
There was a formula
Sharp as a knife
Facts cut a hole in us I'm still waiting, I-I-I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting, I-I-I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting, I-I-I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting, I-I-I'm still waiting The feeling returns
Whenever we close our eyes
Lifting my head
Looking around inside The island of doubt
It's like the taste of medicine
Working by hindsight
Got the message from the oxygen
M-m-making a list
Find the cost of opportunity
Doing it right
Facts are useful in emergencies The feeling returns
Whenever we close our eyes
Lifting my head
Looking around inside Facts are simple and facts are straight
Facts are lazy and facts are late
Facts all come with points of view
Facts don't do what I want them to
Facts just twist the truth around
Facts are living turned inside out
Facts are getting the best of them
Facts are nothing on the face of things I'm still waiting, I-I-I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting, I-I-I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting, I-I-I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting, I-I-I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting, I-I-I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting, I-I-I'm still waiting Mojique sees his village from a nearby hill
Mojique thinks of days before Americans came
He serves the foreigners in growing numbers
He sees the foreigners in fancy houses
He dreams of days that he can still remember now Mojique holds a package in his quivering hands
Mojique sends the package to the American man
Softly he glides along the streets and alleys
Up comes the wind that makes them run for cover
He feels the time is surely now or never more The wind in my heart, the wind in my heart
The dust in my head, the dust in my head
The wind in my heart, the wind in my heart
Come to drive them away, drive them away The wind in my heart, the wind in my heart
The dust in my head, the dust in my head
The wind in my heart, the wind in my heart
Come to drive them away, drive them away And Mojique buys his equipment in the market place
Mojique plants devices through the free trade zone
He feels the wind is lifting up his people
He calls the wind to guide him on his mission
He knows his friend the wind is always standing by Mojique smells the wind that, that comes from far away
Mojique waits for news in a quiet place
He feels the presence of the wind beside him
He feels the power of the past behind him
He has the knowledge of the wind to guide him on The wind in my heart, the wind in my heart
The dust in my head, the dust in my head
The wind in my heart, the wind in my heart
Come to drive them away, drive them away The wind in my heart, the wind in my heart
The dust in my head, the dust in my head
The wind in my heart, the wind in my heart
Come to drive them away Nothing can come between us
Nothing gets you down
Nothing strikes your fancy
Nothing turns you on You don't have to wait for more instructions
No one makes a monkey out of me
We lie on our backs, feet in the air
Rest and relaxation rocket to my brain Snap into position
Bounce till you ache
Step out of line (and)
You end up in jail Bring me a doctor
I have a hole in my head
They are just people
And I'm not afraid Doctor, doctor
We have nothing in our pockets
We continue
But we have nothing left to offer
Faces pressed against the window
Hey... they are just my friends
Check this out, don't be so slick
Break our backs, it goes like this We are born without eyesight
We are born without sin
And our mama protects us
From the cold and the rain
We're in no hurry
Sugar and spice
We sing in the darkness
We open our eyes (Open up) I can't believe it
And people are strange
Our president's crazy
Did you hear what he said?
Business and pleasure
Lie right to your face
Divide it in sections
And give it away Well, there are no big secrets
Don't believe what you read
We have great big bodies
We got great big heads
Run--a, run--a, run it all together
Check it out
Still don't make no sense
Makin' flippy floppy
Tryin' to do my best
Lock the door
We kill the beast
Kill it! And all I see is little dots
Some are smeared, some are spots
Feel like a murder but that's alright
Somebody said there's too much light
Pull down that shade and it's alright
It'll be over in a minute or two I'm charged up, don't put me down
Don't feel like talking, don't mess around
I feel mean, but I feel okay
I'm charged up, electricity
Is that what you calling The boys are making a big mess
This makes the girls all start to laugh
I don't know what they're talking about
The boys are worried, the girls are shocked
They pick the sound and let it drop
Nobody knows what they're talking about I'm charged up, [Incomprehensible]
Don't tell the truth, I just tell lies
I'm picking up, but I left off
I'm charged up, it's pretty intense I'm charged up, don't put me down
Don't feel like talking, don't mess around
And I feel mean, I feel okay
I'm charged up, electricity
That's right, [Incomprehensible] Oh well, I'm dressed up so nice
And I'm doing my best
And I'm starting over
I'm starting over in another place Lemme tell you a story
A big chief with a golden crown
He's got rings on his fingers
And then he walks up, up to the throne He's making shapes with his hands
And don't you dare sit back
And don't you dare sit down
And don't you dare speak up And on the first day we had everything we could stand
Who could've asked for more?
And on a second day there was nothing else left to do
Oh what a day that was Well there are fifty thousand beggars
Roaming in the streets
And they have lost all their possessions
And they have nothing left to eat Down come a bolt of lightning
Start an electrical storm
And starts a chain reaction
"Go pull a fire alarm", I said that I'm dreaming of a city
It was my own invention
I put the wheels in motion
A time for big decisions And on the first day we had everything we could stand
Oh and then we let it fall
And on a second day there was nothing else left at all
Oh what a day that was What a day that was
And that's the way it goes
There's a million ways to get things done
There's a million ways to make things work out Oh well, I'm going right through
And the light came down
And they're rounding them up
From all over town They're moving forward and backwards
Moving backwards and front
And they're enjoying themselves
Moving in every direction And if you feel like you're in a whirlpool
You feel like going home
You feel like talking to someone
Who know the difference between right and wrong And on the first day we had everything we could stand
Oh and then we let it fall
And on a second day there was nothing else left at all
Oh what a day that was We're going boom, boom, boom and that's the way we live
And in a great big room and that's the way we live
We're going boom, boom, boom and that's the way we live
And in a great big room and that's the way we live
We're going boom, boom, boom and that's the way we live
And in a great big room and that's the way we live I wanna bicycle
I wanna popsicle
I wanna space face
Buy me a cherry face now Hey now

Would the light come and hit you in the eyes?
Hey
Gonna stop, gonna get you by surprise Every night when the sun goes down
And the people are staying at home
You can tell your momma and daddy
Leave those children alone They know what they're doin'
They ain't runnin' away
Uncle John said, "Tell Aunt Mary
I got nothing to say"
(And she say:) Hey now

Hey now now Do you remember anyone here?
No you don't remember anything at all
I'm sleeping, I'm flat on my back
Never woke up, had no regrets
There's a party in my mind
And it never stops
There's a party up there all the time
They'll party till they drop
Other people can go home
Everyone else will split
I'll be here all the time
I can never quit
Take a walk through the land of shadows
Take a walk through the peaceful meadows
Don't look so disappointed
It isn't what you hoped for, is it?
There's a party in my mind
And I hope it never stops
I'm stuck here in this seat
I might not stand up
Other people can go home
Everyone else will split
I'll be here all the time
I can never quit
Everything is very quiet
Everyone has gone to sleep
I'm wide awake on memories
These memories can't wait
Memories can't wait
These memories can't wait
These memories can't wait
These memories can't wait
... Falling, falling
Gonna drop like a stone
I'm falling through the atmosphere
On a warm afternoon
If lovers discover
That everyone dies
So don't tell me, please hold me
It's a dangerous life Daddy, dear, let's get outta here
I'm scared
Ten o'clock, nighttime in New York
It's weird If you're looking for trouble
Well, that's what you will find Mom and Pop, they will fuck you up
For sure
Love so deep, kills you in your sleep
It's true Love keeps us together
And love will keep us alive And we are criminals that never broke no laws
And all we needed was a net to break our fall Ha, they're searching for diamonds
They're grabbing at straws
Sex and sin, sax and violins
It's hell
Wooden heads, furniture with legs
For sale Love keeps us together
And love will drive us insane And we are criminals that never broke no laws
And all we needed was a net to break our fall Going home, back where I belong
To stay
The rays of light, they will turn the night
To day Birds travel together
Birds follow the sun
And I am watching as the birds go flying home Now, let me tell you a story
The Devil, he has a plan
Bag of bones in his pocket
Get anything you want
No dust, no rocks
The whole thing is over
All those beauties in solid motion
All those beauties
They're gonna swallow you up Let's go
Hi, hi-hi-hi-hi-hi
Hi, hi-hi-hi-hi-hi, hi One time too many
Too far to go
Hi, we've come to take you home, whoo-oo When they split those atoms
It's hotter than the Sun
Blood is a special substance
They gonna pray for that man
So wake up, young lovers
The whole thing is over
Watch out, touch monkeys
All that blood
They're gonna swallow you whole Let's go
Hi, hi-hi-hi-hi-hi
Hi, hi-hi-hi-hi-hi, hi What's that? who's driving?
Where we going? who knows?
Hi, we've come to take you home, whoo-oo How many people do you think I am?
Pretend I am somebody else
You can pretend I'm a old millionare
A millionare washin' his hands
Rattle the bones of dreams that stick out
A medical chart on the wall
Soft violins, hands touch your throat
Everyone wants to explode Now, when your hands get dirty
Nobody knows you at all
Don't have a window to slip out of
Lights on, nobody home
Click-click, see ya later
Beta-beta, and no time to rest
Picka-picka, risky business
All that blood will never cover that mess Let's go
Hi, hi-hi-hi-hi-hi
Hi, hi-hi-hi-hi-hi, hi So soft, hard feeling
No tricks, let's go
Hi, we've come to take you home, whoo-oo

Seems like the world knows nothing at all.
The world is near but it's out of reach,
Some people touch it, but they can't hold on. She ... is moving to describe the world.
(Night must fall -- darker, darker.)
(She ... has got to move the world ... to move the world ... to move the world.)
She ... has messages for everyone.

Hands that move her are invisible.
(Night must fall -- darker, darker.)
(She ... has got to move the world ... to move the world ... to move the world.) The world has a way of looking at people.
Sometimes we feel that the world is wrong.
She loves the world, and all the people in it,
She shakes 'em up when she start to walk. She ... is only partly human being.
(Wanna define, she is moving to define, so say so, so say so.)
She ... defines the possibilities.
(Wanna define, she is moving to define, so say so, so say so.)
Holding on for an eternity.
(Wanna define, she is moving to define, so say so, so say so.)
Gone ... and ending without finishing.
(Wanna define, she is moving to define, so say so, so say so.) The world moves on a woman's hips!
The world moves and it swivels and bops!
The world moves on a woman's hips!
The world moves and it bounces and hops! A world of light ... she gonna open our eyes up!

[x8] For a long time I felt without style or grace
Wearing shoes with no socks in cold weather
I knew my heart was in the right place
I knew I'd be able to do these things. And as we watch him digging his own grave
It is important to know that was where he's at
He can't afford to stop... That is what he believe
He'll keep on digging for a thousand years. I'm walking a line-I'm thinking about empty motion
I'm walking a line-Just barely enough to be living
Get outa the way-No time to begin
This isn't the time-So nothing was done
Not talking about-Not many at all
I'm turning around-No trouble at all
You notice there's nothing around you, around you
I'm walking a line-Divide and dissolve. Never get to say much, never get to talk
Tell us a little bit, but not too much
Right about then, is where she give up
She has closed her eyes, she has give up hope I'm walking a line-I hate to be dreaming in motion
I'm walking a line-Just barely enough to be living
Get outa the way-No time to begin
This isn't the time-So nothing was done
Not talking about-Not many at all
I'm turning around-No trouble at all
I'm keeping my fingers behind me, 'hind me
I'm walking a line-Divide and dissolve. I turn myself around, I'm moving backwards and forwards
I'm moving twice as much as I was before
I'll keep on digging to the center of the Earth
I'll be down in there moving the in the room... I'm walking a line-Visiting houses in motion
I'm walking a line-Just barely enough to be living
Get outa the way-No time to begin
This isn't the time-So nothing was done
Not talking about-Not many at all
I'm turning around-No trouble at all
Two different houses surround you, 'round you
I'm walking a line-Divide and dissolve. I'm wearing-a fur pajamas
I ride a hot potato
It's tickling my fancy
Speak up, I can't hear you Here on this mountaintop, oh-oh-oh
I got some wild, wild life
I got some news to tell you, oh-oh
About some wild, wild life
Here come the doctor in charge, oh-oh-oh
She's got some wild, wild life
Ain't that the way you like it, oh-oh?
Living wild, wild life I'll wrestle with your conscience
You wrestle with your partner
Sitting on a windowsill
But he spends his time behind closed doors So check out mister businessman, oh-oh-oh
He bought some wild, wild life
On the way to the stock exchange, oh-oh-oh
He got some wild, wild life
Pick it up when he opens the door, oh-oh-oh
He doing wild, wild life
I know it's the way you like it, oh-oh
Living wild, wild Peace of mind
It's a piece of cake
Thought control
You get on board any time you like Like sitting on pins and needles
Things fall apart
It's scientific Sleeping on the Interstate, oh-oh-oh
Getting wild, wild life
Checking in and checking out, oh-oh-oh
I got 'em, wild, wild life
Spending all of my money and time, oh-oh-oh
On too much wild, wild life
We wanna go and we go where we go, oh-oh-oh
Ah, doing wild, wild life
I know it, that's how we start, oh-oh-oh
Got some wild, wild life
Take a picture here in the daylight, oh-oh
And it's a wild, wild life
You've grown so tall, you've grown so fast, oh-oh-oh
Wild, wild
And I know that's the way you like it, oh-oh
Living wild, wild, wild, wild life I'm writing 'bout the
Book I read
I have to sing about the
Book I read
I'm embarassed to admit it hit the soft spot in my heart
When I found out you wrote the
Book I read so Take my shoulders as they touch your arms I've
Got little cold chills but I feel alright The
Book I Read was in your eyes oh oh Oh... I'm living in the future.
I feel wonderful.
I'm tipping over backwards
I'm so ambitious
I'm looking back I'm

Na na na na... oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oooooh... I'm living in the future
I feel wonderful
I'm tipping over backwards
I'm so ambitious
I'm looking back I'm
Running a race and you're the books I read so Feel my fingers as they touch you arms I'm
Spinning around and I feel alright
The book I read was in your eyes Na na na na na... na na na na na na na
Na na na na... na na na na na na na na
Na na na na... na na na na na na na na
Na na na na... na na na na na na na na
Na na na na... na na na na na na na na
Na na na na... na na na na na na na na
Na na na na... oh oh oh oh oh oh oooh. I have tried marijuana I get nervous every time
There will come a knockin' at the door
Why is everybody makin' eyes at me?
I don't want to know Excuse and pardon me
Stay for a while maybe we'll never meet again And I can see my lifetime piling up, I can see the days turn into nights
I can see the people on the street open those windows up
A hundred floors below me pilin' those houses up
Pilin' them higher, higher, higher can feel them swayin' back and forth
Building it higher, higher this tower's leaning over I got bad coordination stuck a pencil in my eye
I can hardly wait to get back home
Why is everybody gettin' paranoid?
I's only havin' fun Scum bags and superstars tell me your names
I'll make a bet, you're both the same I can see my lifetime pilin' up reaching from my bedroom to the stars
I can see the house where I was born
When I was growin' up they say that I could never keep my trousers up
I remember days and crazy nights, are there any pirates on this ship?
And if they sober up they? ll have us home by morning Cry, cry, cry it's just you and I
Like an automobile with no one at the wheel
Spinning out of control we're all over the road
In our sexy machine oh, all the passengers scream
Scream, scream I can see my lifetime pilin' up, I can see it smashin' into yours
It was not an accident at all open your window up I hear you laughin'
Going one two three four five goin' from the bottom to the top
Maybe I'm holding on too tight and now I'm throwin' up
I got a funny feeling pilin' them houses up, pilin' them higher, higher, higher
Building that highway to the stars turning the music up
Hey I got a winning number I see the clouds that move across the sky
I see the wind that moves the clouds away
It moves the clouds over by the building
I pick the building that I want to live in I smell the pine trees and the peaches in the woods
I see the pinecones that fall by the highway
That's the highway that goes to the building
I pick the building that I want to live in It's over there, it's over there
My building has every convenience
It's gonna make life easy for me
It's gonna be easy to get things done
I will relax alone with my loved ones Loved ones, loved ones visit the building
take the highway, park and come up and see me
I'll be working, working but if you come visit
I'll put down what I'm doing, my friends are important Don't you worry 'bout me
I wouldn't worry about me
Don't you worry 'bout me
Don't you worry 'bout me I see the states, across this big nation
I see the laws made in Washington, D.C.
I think of the ones I consider my favorites
I think of the people that are working for me Some civil servants are just like my loved ones
They work so hard and they try to be strong
I'm a lucky guy to live in my building
They own the buildings to help them along It's over there, it's over there
My building has every convenience
It's gonna make life easy for me
It's gonna be easy to get things done
I will relax along with my loved ones Loved ones, loved ones visit the building
Take the highway, park and come up and see me
I'll be working, working but if you come visit
I'll put down what I'm doing, my friends are important I wouldn't worry 'bout
I wouldn't worry about me
Don't you worry 'bout me
Don't you worry 'bout me Near where you are standing, the dinosaurs did a dance
The Indians told a story how it has come to pass
The Indians had a legend, the Spaniards lived for gold
White men came and killed them, but they haven't really gone We live in the city of dreams
We drive on this highway of fire
Should we awake to find it gone
Remember this, our favorite town From Germany and Europe and southern U.S.A.
They made this little town here that we live in to this day
The children of the white man saw Indians on TV
And heard about the legend, how their city was a dream We live in the city of dreams
We drive on this highway of fire
Should we awake and find it gone
Remember this, our favorite town The Civil War is over, and World War I and II
If we can live together, the dream, it might come true
Underneath the concrete, the dream is still alive
A hundred million lifetimes, a world that never dies We live in the city of dreams
We drive on this highway of fire
Should we awake and find it gone
Remember this, our favorite town
We live in the city of dreams
We drive on this highway of fire
Should we awake and find it gone
Remember this, our favorite town Heard of a van that is loaded with weapons
Packed up and ready to go
Heard of some gravesides, out by the highway
A place where nobody knows The sound of gunfire off in the distance
I'm getting used to it now
Lived on brownstone, lived in the ghetto
I've lived all over this town This ain't no party, this ain't no disco
This ain't no fooling around
No time for dancing or lovey dovey
I ain't got time for that now Transmit the message to the receiver
Hope for an answer some day
I got three passports, couple of visas
You don't even know my real name High on a hillside, the trucks are loading
Everything's ready to roll
I sleep in the daytime, I work in the nighttime
I might not ever get home This ain't no party, this ain't no disco
This ain't no fooling around
This ain't no mudd club, or C.B.G.B.
I ain't got time for that now Heard about Houston? Heard about Detroit?
Heard about Pittsburgh, P A?
You oughta know not to stand by the window
Somebody see you up there I got some groceries, some peanut butter
To last a couple of days
But I ain't got no speakers, ain't got no headphones
Ain't got no records to play Why stay in college? Why go to night school?
Gonna be different this time?
Can't write a letter, can't send no postcard
I ain't got no time for that now Trouble in transit, got through the roadblock
We blended in with the crowd
We got computers, we're tapping phone lines
I know that all ain't allowed We dress like students, we dress like housewives
Or in a suit and a tie
I changed my hairstyle so many times now
I don't know what I look like You make me shiver, I feel so tender
We make a pretty good team
Don't get exhausted, I'll do some driving
You ought to get you some sleep Burned all my notebooks, what good are notebooks?
They won't help me survive
My chest is aching, burns like a furnace
The burning keeps me alive Get your instructions, follow directions
Then you should change your address
Maybe tomorrow, maybe the next day
Whatever you think is best Try to stay healthy, physical fitness
Don't wanna catch no disease
Try to be careful, don't take no chances
You better watch what you say Whoo-hoo-hoo
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo Well, I know what it is
But I don't know where it is
Where it is
Well, I know where it is
But I don't know what it looks like
What it looks like
Well, I know what it looks like
But I don't know where she comes from
Well, I know where she comes from
But I don't know what's her name And she said
This is a perfect world
Riding on an incline
I'm staring in your face
You'll photograph mine Mm-mm-mm
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh And I've been walking, talking
Believing the things that are true
And I've been finding
The difference between right and wrong, bad and good
See me put things together
Put them back where they belong
When I look at each other
Have I always been singing the same song? She said
This is a perfect world
Riding on an incline
I'm staring in your face
You'll photograph mine I-I-I-I-I
Whoo, ah-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha Somebody said that it happens all over the world
I do believe that it's true
And the sun's coming up
And we're doing all the things that we should, ah
Doesn't everybody here believe in the things that we do, ah? And she said
This is a perfect world
Riding on an incline
I'm staring in your face
You'll photograph mine Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Ooh-ee
Mm, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha Hey, strange situation
Ooh, what's wrong with you?
Ha. baby, baby, baby
What you doing in my house?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
And I said it's all true
Hey, hey, hey
There's nothing wrong with you And I said
This is a perfect world
Riding on an incline
I'm staring in your face
You'll photograph mine In 1950 when I was born
Papa couldn't afford to buy us much
He said be proud of what you are
There's something special 'bout people like us People like us
(Who will answer the telephone)
People like us
(Growing as big as a house)
People like us
(Gonna make it because) We don't want freedom
We don't want justice
We just want someone to love.
Someone to love.
I was called upon in the 3rd grade class

And times were hard for people like us People like us

People like us
(Growing as big as a house)
People like us
(Gonna make it because) We don't want freedom

We just want someone to love.
Someone to love. What good is freedom?
God laughs at people like us
I see it coming
Like a light coming down from above The clouds roll by and the moon comes up
How long must we live in the heat of the sun
Millions of people are waitin' on love
And this is a song about people like us People like us
(Who will answer the telephone)
People like us
(Growing big as a house)
People like us
(Gonna make it because)
We don't want freedom
We don't want justice
We just want someone to love. Someone to love.
Someone to love.
Someone to love. You'll be, hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm, magnet for money
You'll be, mm-mm-mm-mm, magnet for love
You'll feel, hmm, light in your body
Now I'm gonna say, gonna say these words: Rompiendo la monotonia del tiempo
Rompiendo la monotonia del tiempo It might hmm-mmm-mm-mm... might rain money
It might hm-hi-hi-hi... It might rain fire
Now I'm gonna call,
Gonna call on Legba.
Get yourself a sign
Get your love and desire. Rompiendo la monotonia del tiempo
Rompiendo la monotonia del tiempo Singin' Papa Legba,
Come and open the gate.
Papa Legba,
To the city of camps.
Now, we're your children
Come and ride your horse
In the night
In the night
Come and ride your horse There is a queen
Of six and sevens and nines
Dust in your garden
Poison in your mind
There is a king
That will steal your soul
Don't let him catch you,
Don't let him get control. Rompiendo la monotonia del tiempo
Rompiendo la monotonia del tiempo Papa Legba,
Come and open the gate
Papa Legba,
To the city of camps
Now, we're your children
Come and ride your horse
In the night
In the night, come and ride your horse
In the night
In the night, come and ride your horse
In the night
In the night, come and ride your horse I wish you wouldn't say that
I thought I'd have to come right over
I thought I made it clear enough
I guess I'll have to make it clearer
Say something to change my mind
Bring me back the way I used to be
If it takes forever that's all right
Say the words that I've been trying to hear
I wish you didn't tell her
I thought I'd have to come right over
I thought I'd have to make it clearer
Now Jimmy's coming over
There are places that I won't forget
And I guess I'm never going back
Guess it's information that I lack
I've told lies without a hint or regret
I wish you wouldn't say that
I wish you wouldn't say that
I wish you wouldn't say that
I wish you wouldn't say that
I wish you wouldn't say that
... Flying saucers, levitation
Yo! I could do that
Get ready for heavy duty
Go on, give it a chance
Give it a chance, give it a chance
I saw your hair start to curl
So get up, write it down
You better wait for a while. So take your hands out of your pockets
And get your face adjusted
I heard it, somebody lied
And I'm staring out the window
Gonna let this thing continue
In its natural time
Round heads, square heads
Get settled in
You can hear my belly rumble
There's a voice that starts to mumble
Woo! It's starting to sing Protons, neutrons
I ate a rock from the moon
Got shocked once, shocked twice
Let's see what it can do
Man in the moon, moon in the man
I got a rock in my throat
Upside, upside down
My tummy starts to talk...(What it say?) Gonna rock it till I shock it
Gonna kick it till I drop it
Woo! Love at first sight
You can kick it, you can poke it
Ooh, I think you broke it
What about that? Skin from a snake, blood from a stone
You know that ain't no lie
I got hundreds of expressions
Try to make a good impression
Woo! Right between the eyes I don't mind--let me go
I don't mind--I don't know
Let me be--why not stay
I feel numb--let me play I got wild imagination
Talkin' transubstantiation
Any version will do
I got mass communication
I'm the human corporation
I ate a rock from the moon
Moon in the rock, rock in the moon
There's a moon in my throat
You might think I'm wasting time
You might laugh, but not for long
Hey! I'm working it out...(work it out) I don't mind--let me go
Sounds inside--I don't know
Let me be--why not stay
I feel numb--let me play Big and I'm bad
And I want you to know
I hang around
Where the grass is greener
Totally naked, baby
Totally nude
'Cause if I want to
Who's gonna stop me?
I'm absolutely free
Living in the trees
The birdies and the bees
'Cause I'm a nature boy
Locked up inside
You can't tell me where it's at
Open up, open up, open the door
Rocks and trees and physical culture
Some days you hide
I guess you wonder where you are
Nature boy, nature man, take me along
We got a life that's undiscovered
We threw it all away
Throw it all away
Rolling in every way
It's irresponsible
So civilized
I guess you wonder where you are
Nature boy, nature man, take me along
Deep in the woods we're undiscovered
I'm a little fish and you're the river
Living in a boat that's underwater
We can tip, tip, tip it over
You can push, push, make it better now
Wake your daddy up
It's a quarter to five
Our little boat
Has lost its rudder
Dive to the bottom
And we never come up
A polka party
For Bob and Martha
I'm absolutely free
Living in the trees
The birdies and the bees
'Cause I'm a nature boy
Think what you like
This is really where it's at
Open up, open up, open the door
We don't need clothes and we don't need money
So civilized
I guess you wonder where you are
Nature boy, nature man, take me along
Deep in the woods we're undiscovered Let's go!
I'm painting, I'm painting again
I'm painting, I'm painting again
I'm cleaning, I'm cleaning again
I'm cleaning, I'm cleaning my brain Pretty soon now I will be bitter
Pretty soon now will be a quitter
Pretty soon now I will be bitter
You can't see it 'til it's finished I don't have to prove... that I am creative!
I don't have to prove... that I am creative!
All my pictures are confused
And now I'm going to take me to you And all I see is little dots
Some are smeared and some are spots
Feels like a murder but that's alright
Somebody said there's too much light
Pull down the shade and it's alright
It'll be over in a minute or two. I'm charged up... Don't put me down
Don't feel like talking... Don't mess around
I feel mean... I feel O.K.
I'm charged up... Electricity The boys are making a big mess
This makes the girls all start to laugh
I don't know what they're talking about
The boys are worried, the girls are shocked
They pick the sound and let it drop
Nobody know what they're talking about I'm charged up... I'm kinda wooden
I'm barely moving... I study motion
I study myself... I fooled myself
I'm charged up... It's pretty intense.
I'm charged up... Don't put me down
Don't feel like talking... Don't mess around
I feel mean... I feel O.K.
I'm charged up... Electricity. I will fight, will fight with my heart
I will fight, will fight with understanding
In my mind the weather never changes
Skill overcomes unfavorable conditions A straight line exists between me and the good thing
I have found the line and its direction is known to me
Absolute trust keeps me going in the right direction
Any intrusion is met with a heart full of the good thing Try to compare what I am presenting
You will meet with much frustration
Try to find... similar situation
You will always find the same solution As the heart finds the good thing, the feeling is multiplied
Add the will to the strength, and it equals conviction
As we economize, efficiency is multiplied
To the extent I am determined the result is the good thing
So I say:
I have adopted this and made it my own
Cut back the weakness, reinforce what is strong When you were little, you dreamed you were big
You must have been something, a real tiny kid
You wish you were me, I wish I was you
Don't you wake up, this dream will come true And every dream has a name
And names tell your story
This song is your dream
You're the dream operator Bigger than life, you know it's all me
My face is a book, but it's not what it seems
Three angels above the whole human race
Dream us to life, they dream me a face And every dream tells it all
And this is your story
You dreamed me a heart
You're the dream operator Shake-it-up dream
Hi-di-ho dream
Fix-it-up dream
Look at me dream
I've been waiting so long
Now I am your dream Hard to forget, it's hard to go on
When you fall asleep, you're out on your own
Let go of your life, grab onto my hand
Here in the clouds where we'll understand And you dreamed it all
And this is your story
Do you know who you are?
You're the dream operator Ooh, and you dreamed it all
And this is your story
Do you know who you are?
You're the dream operator I see the shapes
I remember from maps
I see the shoreline
I see the whitecaps
A baseball diamond
Nice weather down there
I see the school
And the houses where the kids are
Places to park
By the factories and buildings
Restaurants and bars
For later in the evening Then we come to the farmlands
And the undeveloped areas
And I have learned
How these things work together
I see the parkway
That passes through them all
And I have learned
How to look at these things, and I say I wouldn't live there if you paid me
I wouldn't live like that, no siree
I wouldn't do the things the way those people do
I wouldn't live there if you paid me to I guess it's healthy
I guess the air is clean
I guess those people
Have fun with their neighbors and friends
Look at that kitchen
And all of that food
Look at them eat it
I guess it tastes real good They grow it in those farmlands
Then they bring it to the store
They put it in the car trunk
And they bring it back home, and I say I wouldn't live there if you paid me
I wouldn't live like that, no siree
I wouldn't do the things the way those people do
I wouldn't live there if you paid me to I'm tired of looking
Out the window of the airplane
I'm tired of traveling
I want to be somewhere
It's not even worth talking
About those people down there, no Goo-goo, ga-ga-ga
Goo-goo, ga-ga-ga
Goo-goo, ga-ga-ga
Goo-goo, ga-ga-ga
Goo-goo, ga-ga-ga
Goo-goo, ga-ga-ga
Goo-goo, ga-ga-ga
Goo-goo, ga-ga-ga
Goo-goo, ga-ga-ga
Goo-goo, ga-ga-ga
Goo-goo, ga-ga-ga
Goo-goo-goo-goo, ga-ga-ga-ga Oh, oh, baby you can walk, you can talk just like me
You can walk, you can talk just like me
You can look, tell me what you see
You can look, you won't see nothing like me
If you look around the world Oh, baby you can walk, you can talk just like me
With a little practice you can walk like, talk just like me
If that's what you wanna do
Well you can look, you'll walk in circles around me
But first, I'll walk in circles around you
But first, I'll walk around the world I'm walking 'round the world
I... you can
I'll walk in circles around you
But first, show me what you can do Found out this morning
There's a circus coming to town
They drive in Cadillacs
Using walkie-talkies, and the Secret Service Their big top
Imitation of life
And all the flags and microphones
We have to cover our eyes We play the sideshows
And we like the tunnel of love
And when we ride the ferris wheel
We're little children again And when they're asking for volunteers
We'll be the first ones aboard
And when the ringmaster calls our names
We'll be the first ones to go ... to sleep Stealing all our dreams
Dreams for sale
They sell 'em back to you On with the show
Start the parade
We sand along
Sweep us away It's political party time
Going down, going down
And the celebrities all come out
Coming down, coming down, coming... The sun is going down
And the dogs are starting to howl
We stay out after dark
Eating cotton candy
And the music's playing... How we all laughed!
We split our sides
The cameras flashed
We almost died! The rain's gonna pour on down, falling out of the sky
Coming down, coming down
And the celebrities all run out, and the rain's
Coming down, coming down Gonna rain,
Gonna rain, gonna rain
Gonna rain, gonna rain,
Rain, rain
Rain, rain And now I wonder who's boss
And who he's leavin' behind? In a world
Where people have problems
In this world
Where decisions are a way of life
Other people's problems
They overwhelm my mind
They say compassion is a virtue
But I don't have the time So many people have their problems
I'm not interested in their problems
I guess I've experienced some problems
But now I've made some decisions It takes a lot of time
To push away the nonsense
Take my compassion
Push it as far as it goes
My interest level's dropping
My interest level is dropping
I've heard all I want to, and I
Don't want to hear any more What are you, in
Love with your problems?
I think you take it
A little too far, it's
Not so cool to have
So many problems
But don't expect me
To explain your indecisions Go talk to your analysts
Isn't that what they're paid for?
Ooh, you, you walk, you talk
You still function like you used to
Ooh, it's not a question
Of your personality or style
Be a little more selfish
It might do you some good In a world
Where people have problems
In this world
Where decisions are a way of life
Other people's problems
They overwhelm my mind
They say compassion is a virtue
But I don't have the time Here we go again a terrible signal
too weak to even recognize
a gentle collapsing
the removal of the insides i'm touched by your pleas
i value these moments
we're older than we realize
...in someone's eyes a frequent returning
and leaving unnoticed
a condition of mercy
a change in the weather a view to remember
the center is missing
they question how the future lies
...in someone's eyes
the gentle collapsing
of every surface
we travel on the quiet road
...the overload Mr. Jones
Put a wiggle in your stride
Loosen up
I believe he'll be all right
He's changing clothes
Now he's got ventilated slacks
Bouncing off the walls
Mr. Jones is back Bulge out

Tight pants
And got curly hair

From metal cans
Moonshine

Short skirts

I had some friends, but I want more Mm
Mm Mm, I see the future, and it's all mine
Want to be perfect, I'm taking my time
I'll try not to act like I'm so far away
I try to be right in whatever I say
Deeper feelings recur again and again and again and again
A complex spiral leads me to spin Mm
Mm I want to live
To see the Earth turn one more time
I wanna live
To feel a hand that isn't mine
I'm only standing on the shore
I had some fun, but I want more
I'll try not to act like I'm so far away
I try to be right in whatever I say
Deeper feelings recur again and again and again and again
A complex spiral leads me to spin Mm
Mm
Mm Wait, wait for the moment to come

We couldn't find a seat
Conductor says he's sorry for
The blisters on our feet
Comes a-riding in a bus
The high and the low
Mommy, daddy, you and i
Going on a trip
And we're not going home
Mommy, daddy, you and i Driving, keep driving
Driving, driving all night
Sleeping on my daddy's shoulder
Drinking from a paper cup
And i'm wearing my grandfather's clothes
And they say that up north it gets cold Crawling out of bed one night
Walking in my sleep
We're not the only family
To take this little trip
Driving all the way up
It's 30 below
Mommy, daddy, you and i
Even little kids
Getting ready to go
Mommy, daddy, you and i Chilly, chilly-willy
It's colder the further we go
Some are born to take advantage
But saying it don't make it so
So hold me and don't let me go
'cause the sidewalks are covered with snow He's speaking english now
And he's smoothing out his clothes
He's mr. button down
He's leaving home Making changes day by day
And we still ain't got no plan
How we gonna make our way
In this foreign land? Well we'll keep driving, keep driving
Driving with all of our might
Changing, still changing
Changing the water of life
Keep that little man a shining
See how the tail can wag the dog And we're all riding in this old bus
And the driver is singing to us
And we're wearing out grandfather's clothes
'cause we heard that up north it gets cold Air... Air
Hit me in the face
I run faster
Faster into the air
(I say to myself)
What is happening to my skin?
Where is that protection that I needed?
Air can hurt you too
Air can hurt you too
Some people say not to worry about the air
Some people never had experience with... Air... Air
It can break your heart
So remember when the weather gets rough
(You'll say to yourself)
What is happening to my skin?
Where is that protection that I needed?
Air can hurt you too
Air can hurt you too
Some people say not to worry about the air
Some people don't know shit about the...
Air... Day by day
Whistle while you work
Our backs are breaking
Up from hollow earth
From end to end
The noise begins
In the human battle stations
And the big one's coming in Work, work, work, work
Work till holes are filled
Work, work, work, work
Bags of bone and skin
Lovers hold hands
Tossing their heads
Tangled in hair
Tied to earth
With skin and glue But their skin is the same as yours
Coming in for the world to see
They can sit at the table, too
The same blood as you and me Speak very softly
Hold my hand
Someone is sleeping
In my bed
Priests pass by
Worms crawl in
One dreams to be
One dream for all His skin is the same as yours
Is he not made the same as you?
And some have fallen down
And blood spilled on the ground
Work, work, work
Till his life is done The old man
Is at our door
And he's knocking
Knocking
As his neighbors weep
Each day repeats
Are we nothing in your eyes?
Someone answer, someone answer
This rusted garden gate
Can barely even stand
Their work is over now
And rest will be at hand Is their skin not the same as yours?
Can they sit at the table to drink
Cool water
Cool water
And his lungs are filled with rain
And the water's rushing in A woman made a man
A man he made a house
And when they lay together
Little creatures all come out Well, I've seen sex and I think it's alright
It makes those little creatures come to life
I can laugh or I can turn away
Well, I've seen sex and I think it's okay We are creatures, creatures of love
We are creatures, creatures of love
From the sleep of reason, a life is born
We are creatures of love, we are creatures of love It's okay to be afraid
When the blue spark hits your brain
We can love one another
I've been told that it's okay Doctor, doctor, tell me what I am
Am I one of those human beings
Well I can laugh or I can learn to think
So help me now to find out what I feel We are creatures, creatures of love
We are creatures, creatures of love
We've been here forever, before you were born
We are creatures of love, we are creatures of love A man can drive a car
And a woman can be a boss
I'm a monkey and a flower
I'm everything at once Well, a woman and a man can be together
If they decide to, they'll make little creatures
Watch 'em now!
Little creature of love
With two arms and two legs
From a moment of passion
Now they cover the bed We are creatures of love, we are creatures of love
We are creatures, creatures of love
We are creatures, creatures of love
From the sleep of reason a life is born
We are creatures of love, we are creatures of love Who? Who is it?

Still Puzzlin'! Huh Last time she jumped out the window, well, she only turned and
smiled. You might think she would say something, but you'd have to
wait a while. Well the lady don't mind.
No, no, no, the lady don't mind
She just turns her head and disappears,
I kinda like that style Little boat that floats on a river, it's drifting through a haze
She stops by whenever she wants to, well, there she goes again Well, it's no trouble at all.
No, no, no trouble at all
Well, what she does
is all right with me, and
I kinda like that style Come on. come on. I go up and down.
I like this curious feeling. I know, I see.
It's like make believe. Cover your ears
so you can hear what I'm saying.
I'm not lost but I don't know
Where I am. I got a question.
All right. All right. This is what we like.
Who knows, who knows,
What I'm thinking She says love is not what she's after,
and everyone knows.
Each time she looks in the mirror,
she lets her feelings show. Well, the lady don't mind
No, no, no, the lady don't mind.
Well, what she says is all right by me,
and I kinda like that style Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Here we go again
I don't know, I don't know,
What I'm sayin'.
Hey man. Hey man.
I sure don't feel the same
She likes to say what she's feeling
Hey. Did I get a big surprise.
I know you think so.
Come on. Come on. She says anything.
Who knows, who knows,
what she's thinking. What you gonna do when you get out of jail?
I'm gonna have some fun
What do you consider fun?
Fun, natural fun
I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend, my laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning and there is no end
Time isn't present in that dimension
He'll take my arm
When we're walkin', rolling and rocking
It's one time I'm glad I'm not a man
Feels like I'm dreaming, but I'm not sleeping
I'm in heaven
With the maven of funk mutation
Clinton's musicians such as Bootsy Collins
Raise expectations to a new intention
No one can sing
Quite like Smokey, Smokey Robinson
Wailin' and shakin' to Bob Marley
Reggae's expanding with Sly and Robbie
All the weekend
Boyfriend was missing
I surely miss him
The way he'd hold me in his warm arms
We went insane when we took cocaine
Stepping in a rhythm to a Kurtis Blow
Who needs to think when your feet just go
With a hiditihi and a hipitiho
Who needs to think when your feet just go
Who needs to think when your feet just go
James Brown, James Brown
James Brown, James Brown
If you see him
Please remind him, unhappy boyfriend
Well he's the genius of love
He's got a greater depth of feeling
Well he's the genius of love
He's so deep Signs, signs are lost
Signs disappeared
Turn invisible
Got no sign
Somebody got busted
Got a face of stone and a
Ghostwritten biography Dogs started rushin' in
Hungry for some food
Dogs started twitching
And they're looking at you It was light by five
Torn all apart
All in the name of democracy
He's hurt, he's dying
Claimed he was a terrorist
Claimed to avert a catastrophe Someone should've told him
That the buck stops here
No one ever said
That he was involved with thieves They're blind, blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
Blind, blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind No sense of harmony, no sense of time
Don't mention harmony, say
"What is it? What is it? What is it?"
Give a little shock, and he raises his hand
Somebody shouts out, says
"What is it? What is it? What is it?" He was shot down in the night!
People ride by but his body's still alive
The girl in the window, what has she done?
She looks down at me and says
"I don't wanna die!" And I'm blind, blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
Blind, blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind Somebody could have told us where they go
Crawling all around looking for foot, foot, footprints
Now tell me what the hell have we become?
Some dirty little bastards, what the hell is going on? No sense of harmony, no sense of time
Don't mention harmony, say
"What is it? What is it? What is it?"
Give a little shock, and he raises his hand
Somebody shouts out, says
"What is it? What is it? What is it?" He was shot down in the night
People ride by but his body's still alive
Girl in the window what has she done?
She looks down at me and says
"I don't want to die!" An' it's blind and they're blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
Blind, blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind Blind, blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
And I'm blind, blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind Time won't change you, money won't change you

Everything seems to be up in the air at this point I need something to change your mind
I need something to change your mind
I need something to change your mind
I need something to change your mind Drugs won't change you, religion won't change you
I haven't got the faintest idea

And it comes directly from my heart to you I need something to change your mind, mind
I need something to change your mind, mind
I need something to change your mind, mind
I need something to change your mind, yeah I was born in a house with the television always on
Guess I grew up too fast
And I forgot my name
We're in cities at night, and we got time on our hands
So leave the driving to us
And it's the real thing And you're rolling
Together
With me
And I can love you
Like a color
TV Now, love is here
C'mon and try it
I got love for sale
Got love for sale
And, now, love is here
C'mon and try it
Got love for sale
Got love for sale You can put your lipstick all over my designer jeans
I'll be a video for you
If you turn my dial
You can cash my check if you go down to the bank, down to the bank
You get two for one
For a limited time, a limited time Push my button
The toast pops up
Love and money
Gettin' all Mixed up, whoah And now, love is here

Yes, it's the look, and now they remember
Had they forgotten... what this all means?
I think they want to forget
And they hope that this time (Chorus)
I won't look, I've got other things to do now
I forgot what it was, I've got to get to work now
(And they) set an example for us (I see it!)
It can happen to me too
(And it) didn't make any difference to us (But I)
Forgot the trouble, that's the trouble
Forgot the trouble, that's the trouble
Forgot the trouble, that's the trouble
Forgot the trouble, that's the trouble
With our love,
With our love,
With our love They hear the words, such as "You're really special"
(And they) can't face that feeling
(And they) can't really tell
I look out the window
(And I) I call that education
(And I) see all my friends standing out there
(And I) I call that education (sophistication) (Repeat chorus) Had they forgotten... what this all means?
Things come and go (and I see 'em)
And I won't be neglected (not this time!) (Repeat chorus) Fooled around enough with numbers
Let's not be ourselves today
Is it just my imagination
Is it just someone's face
Pleasantly out of proportion
It's hard to hold on to the ground
Now I didn't come to run
And this is everything
And gravity lets you down I get wild, wizing up
I just can't let go
I get wild when I get ready
I can hardly talk
Living lights
Special lights
Yellow turns blue
I get wild It's automatic
I can hardly move Go ahead and pull the curtains
Check to see if I'm still here
Let me lose my perspective
Something worth waiting for
Somewhere in South Carolina
And gravity don't mean a thing
And all around the world
Each and ev'ryone
Playing with a heart of steel I get up climbing out
How did I get home?
I'll survive the situation
Somebody shut the door
Beautiful
Beautiful
Climbing up the wall
I get by on automatic
No surprise at all No one here can recognize you
Here is ev'rything that you like
Feelings without explanations
Somethings are hard to describe
The sound of a cigarette burning
A place there where ev'rything spins
And the sounds inside your mind
Is playing all the time
Playing with a heart of steel I get wild, wizing up
I just can't let go
I get wild when I get ready
I can hardly talk
Red 'n' white black to gold
Yellow turns blue
I get wild It's automatic
I can hardly move I get up pushing up
How did I get home?
I'll survive the situation
Somebody shut the door
Shut the door
Shut the door
Climbing up the wall
I get by on automatic

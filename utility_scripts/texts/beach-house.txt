Read my fortune to
Tell me what you see
Cross it like a T
It's all the same to me
This game I play, I do it every day
I promise I'll be fine
Bear it every time When you turn the lights down low
Lemon color, honey glow See this state I'm in
Is crawling in my skin
Fever's took me back
And turned me inside out When you turn the lights down low
Lemon color, honey glow It's what you do
This pulls me through
To the other end
Where it begins
You see through me
Still, it's coming back
I come alive
You stay all night Feel it coming right through you
The color of your mind
The color of your mind
The color of your mind
You feel it coming right through you
You feel it coming right through you
It's on the other side
It's doesn't have to be this way
It's doesn't have to be this way
The color of your mind It's what you do
This pulls me through
I come alive
You stay all night
It's what you do
This pulls me through
I come alive
You stay all night Candy colored mystery
The color of your mind Pay no mind
It takes time
What's that you say Down the hall
I heard a song
Who knows
Drifting away Baby at night when I look at you
Nothing in this world keeps me confused
All it takes, look in your eyes All of me
Is to tow the waste
What's that you say
It's going away It's painful but
You do what you must
Takes time to know Baby at night when I look at you
Nothing in this world keeps me confused
All it takes, look in your eyes Who knows if there're roses in heaven
Let go of that empty feeling
Not dumber just a little bit older
Kiss of love couldn't be much colder Drifting in and out
See the road you're on You came rolling down the cheek
You say just what you need
And in between
It's never as it seems Help me to name it
Help me to name it If you built yourself a myth
You'd know just what to give What comes after this
momentary bliss?
The consequence
of what you do to me Help me to name it
Help me to name it Found yourself in a new direction
Aeons far from the sun
Can you come?
Would they come to breach you?
Let you know you're not the only one You can't keep hangin' on
to all that's dead and gone If you built yourself a myth
You'd know just what to give
Do you lie?
Oh, let the ashes fly Help me to name it
Help me to name it It was late at night
You held on tight
From an empty seat
A flash of light It would take awhile
To make you smile
Somewhere in these eyes
I'm on your side You wide-eyed girls
You get it right Fall back into place
Fall back into place Tender is the night
For a broken heart
Who will dry your eyes
When it falls apart What makes this fragile world go 'round?
Were you ever lost
Was she ever found?
Somewhere in these eyes Fall back into place
Fall back into place You are coming home
are you still alone
are you not the same as you used to be as the sun grows hot
will you save your time
does each day just feel like another life now you know that it is just for show
just a foolish game that you hide behind dont forget the nights
when it all felt right
are you not the same as you used to be
used to be in an endless life
would you feel the fright
of an age that was and could never be
so we hold it close
with the finger post
like a love that we could not leave behind we turn the wheel to each way we feel
till our bones
dont forget the nights when it all felt right
are you not the same as you used to be
used to be even if i tried so hard
would we still be coming to an end
even if we spoke the same words
would we still be turned as friends
even if it was simple from start
with the pieces of a heart
even if there is nothing left to tell
we would know its coming to an end
even if we tried so hard
we would give the pieces of a heart
its always good to see you again
even if its coming to an end In the blue of this night
Where it ends in the light
When you couldn't sleep
You would come for me Wonder eyes, motion high
And I don't dare, slip on by
Make us suffer, like no other
Is nothing like lapis lazuli
Let it go, back to me Like no other you can't be replaced
Like no other you can't be replaced
Like no other you can't be replaced
Like no other you can't be replaced
Like no other you can't be replaced
Like no other you can't be replaced
Like no other you can't be replaced
Like no other you can't be replaced
Like no other you can't be replaced.... You know you're gold, you don't gotta
worry none
Oasis child, born and so wild
Don't I know you better than the rest
All deception, all deception from you Your love is stag in the white sand
Wilderness for miles, eyes so mild and
wise
Don't I know you better than the rest
All deception, all deception from you Any way you run, you run before us
Black and white horse arching among
us Any way you run, you run before us
Black and white horse arching among
us Your love is stag in the white sand
Oasis child born into a man
Don't I know you better than the rest
All deception, all deception from you
Wilderness for miles, eyes so mild and
wise
Oasis child, born and so wild
Don't I know you better than the rest
All deception, all deception from you Any way you run, you run before us Black and white horse arching among us Any way you run, you run before us
Black and white horse arching among
us Any way you run, you run before us
Black and white horse arching among
us Any way you run, you run before us
Black and white horse arching among
us Read my fortune to

This pulls me through
I come alive
You stay all night Candy colored mystery
The color of your mind Out in the heartland
I looked into your eyes
And I asked
"Are you ready? Ready for this life?" Did you see it coming
It happened so fast
The timing was perfect
Water on glass Like tracing figure eights
On ice in skates oh well
And if this ice
Should break
It would be
My mistake Between the cities
Between the thrills
There's something inside you
It doesn't sleep well It won't last forever
Or maybe it will
The white clothes they gave you
You wear them so well Someone once told me
In love, that you must
Place all you're given
In infinite trust Yet I'm tracing figure eights
On ice in skates so well
And if this ice should break
It would be
My mistake You hear my cry, lover of mine
No tear in the eye or fear in my mind
The forest is thick and you don't recognize
We parted our lips and we reached from inside
In a wide open field we know we can feel
Awake and unreal, off to nowhere
Need more people to be satisfied
No fear of a god and prayer for the night
You come into our minds and rush through our lives
We parted our lips and reached from inside
In a wide open field we know we can feel
Awake and unreal, off to nowhere
The only thing you've got, you know you're better off without it
Youngest fire, you decide
You decide what is right
Near yet so far, isn't it? You go for a walk in the park 'cause you don't need anything
Your hand that you sometimes hold doesn't do anything
The face that you see in the door isn't standing there anymore In a matter of time, it would slip from my mind
In and out of my life, you would slip from my mind
In a matter of time The face that you saw in the door isn't looking at you anymore
The name that you call in its place isn't waiting for your embrace
The world that you love to behold cannot hold you anymore In a matter of time it, would slip from my mind
In and out of my life, you would slip from my mind
In a matter of time More, you want more
More, you want more
More, you want more, you tell me
More, only time can run me
More, you want more, you tell me
More, only time can run me
More, you want more you tell me
More, only time can run me
More, you want more, you tell me
More, only time can run me
More, you want more, you tell me
More, only time can run me
More, you want more, you tell me The first thing that I do before I get into your house
I'm gonna tear off all the petals from the rose that's in your mouth I wanted to find ever since I didn't understand
They take the simple things inside you
And put nightmares in your hands This thing comes to me
Heartbreak did this
He was made to believe
That he should live without it
Our nerves would've seen
No change in his
Vision sprung into dreams
Of a world left without it I really wanna know
I really do breathe
We really do breathe
We really wanna know The last thing that she sees before they turn off all the lights
Was there, net up in the corner with the spiders made of night
We really wanna know
Our nerves would've seen
And I can't live without it
Could you ever believe I really wanna know
I really wanna know can i wait the hours till they find me climb up to the tower so that u could see
violence in the flowers where they found you
can i wait the hours
would it be untrue
clim up to the tower
so that u can see
all across the hours
frightened eyes looking back at me
change your mind
dont care about me
frightened eyes
looking back at me
change your mind
dont leave without me
frightened eyes
made in your reflection so that you can feel
mad in your intentions
fear it isnt real
all the recollections
spinning in a field
left in your possession
til it isnt real
you say it isnt real
frightened eyes looking back at me
change your mind
dont care about me
frightened eyes
looking back at me
change your mind
dont leave without me
frightened eyes
its deeper than you and me
its further than you can see
its to much to ask tell me
its all in a glance youll see
its farther than we can be
its deeper than you and me
frightenes eyes We gather matters of the heart
So we can act a fool
It's incomplete without you
The silver soul is running through
It's a vision
Complete illusion, yeah The needle on the spinning wheel
Collecting silver coil
It gathers heat without you
Whether or not you're turned from it
It's a quick turn
To let us in, yeah It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
Ah, it is happening again The bodies lying in the sand
They're moving in the dark
It is so quick to let us in
Feel it moving through our skin
It's a sickness
Infinite quickness, yeah It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
Ah, it is happening again
It is happening again
Ah, it is happening again
It is happening again
Ah, it is happening again
It is happening again
Ah, it is happening again
It is happening again You always come to the parties
to pluck the feathers off all the birds
all your needs
I will not beg you please I want your picture but not your words
you know they want it but there's no verse
on your own
but you cannot call it your all We always run our heads too much
we know the reason, but such and such
on your own
you will not catch your unkown We run our fingers together
you know it's easy the devil's plan
on your own
you cannot call me your heart Jack of all trades
master of none
cry all the time
cause I'm not having fun You always want to be forgiven
the devil does what you ask of him
on your knees
but you cannot; you will not agree In the middle of the party
Found a hole to be sorry
Through the glass
Drank a memory of her face All the charm in the evening
Peridot television
Loveless another
Daughter and mother Shut the door she'll have no more another vodka cocktail party
Her story unravels like a ribbon in the windy distance Schoolgirls were praying
Lace curtains fading
Fern of the forest
Dearly beloved Hard to hear she spit on you and made your bloody nose more bloody
Shut the door she'll have no more another vodka cocktail party Totems in the night
I want to forget
All that wasn't right
I need to leave Totems in the night
I want to forget
All that wasn't right
I need to leave it Totems in the night
I want to forget
All that wasn't right
She needs to leave it Though you hardly know her
Lights on its way
The hand that rests upon it
Still wanna stay No way of recognizing
The cat knows the call
Fair child is rising
There's no mystery at all Uhhhhhh uhhhhhhh It's a strange paradise
You'll be waiting No better color
Look everywhere
We're driving home every night
The shadows stay by your side You built a city
All in your head
Triangle of every light
It turns you on every night Need a companion
My head in prayer
You know you're not losing your mind
What's left you make something of it
Sky what's left above it
The way you want nothing of it
Baby I'm yours No better color
Look everywhere
You built a city
All in your head
You know you're not losing your mind
What's left you make something of it
Sky what's left above it
The way you want nothing of it
Wildflower No one could find you
I love you
All things I loved
But do not know And hope will rule
These days of candy
Live in your mind
Those violet lights
Wide, fenced and wise Across my eyes
A world inside you
No faltered ground
My true one
The words inside
Live in your mind Just like clay, it's gone
Just like clay, it's gone
Just like clay I know it comes too soon
The universe is riding off with you
I hope, I feel, I know
A little bit of feeling, keep it close to me
I know it comes too soon
The universe is riding off with you
I know it comes too soon
I know it stays for eternity
I want to know you there
The universe is riding off with you I met you somewhere
In a air beneath the stairs
There's someone in that room
That frightens you when they go, boo Boo, boo, boo
Boo, boo, boo
Boo, boo, boo
Boo, boo, boo The color you say is black
Is the one you might lack
In the sights of your eyes
Is there a righteous prize? Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I met you, I met you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh There's something wrong with our hearts
When they need care they stand apart
In the bland moonlight watch this seabird fall
Real love it finds you somewhere with your back to it Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I met you, I met you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh You know, you know we belong
By the stream to the dawn
You know, you know we belong
By the stream to the dawn You know, you know we belong
By the stream to the dawn
You know, you know we belong
By the stream to the dawn To your sons and daughters
Bending at the altar
Disappearing in the mirror Watch it as it burns out
(It is just a flame)
Freckle faced young virgin
(It is just a game) Platinum vision
Bringing you down again and again
Again and again Black clock looming distant
You're a great white
They were never listening
Waiting for the light to come again Deep beneath the waves
Lilies of the day
Garden of remains
Diamond maiden chained To your sons and daughters
Bending at the altar
Don't you disappear in the mirror again and again
Again and again Deep beneath the waves
White-winged birds of May
Run from hollow hills
Walk into the night Deep beneath the waves
Lilies of the day
Run from hollow hills
Walk into the night So you thought it would happen
good day, goodbye
I know where no one can reach you
no I don't mind
It's your word why would you fake it
these days go by
as you turn around ow-ow-ow... Other people want to keep in touch
something happens and it's not enough
never thought that it would mean so much
other people want to keep in touch. Heaven won't keep us together
right place at the wrong time
It takes all kinds of weather
distant new skies
Somewhere no one can reach us
these days go by
as you turn around ow-ow-ow... Other people want to keep in touch
something happens and it's not enough
never thought that it would mean so much
other people want to keep in touch. Was it ever quite enough... The heart is a stone, and this is a stone that we throw
Put your hand on this stone, it's the stone of a home you know
They say we will go far, but they don't know how far we'll go
With our legs on the edge and our feet on the horizon They say we can throw far, but they don't know how far we throw
With our legs on the edge and our feet on the horizon
The heart is a stone, and this is a stone that we throw
They say we will go far, but they don't know how far we'll go It can't be gone
We're still right here
It took so long
Can't say we heard it all
Limbs parallel
We stood so long, we fell
Tear a moment from the days
That carry us on forever This push and pull is the force of a wave of time
In the heat of a night we would cry, you are not mine
They said we would go far, but they didn't know how far we'd go
'Cause this heart is a stone, and this is a stone that we throw It can't be gone
We're still right here
It took so long
Can't say we saw it all
Limbs parallel
We stood so long, we fell
Bright pyramids at night
That carry us on forever It can't be gone
We're still right here
It took so long
Can't say we felt it all
Limbs parallel
We stood so long, we fell
Love's like a pantheon
It carries on forever In your heart of chambers
Where you sit
With your picture books
And your ancient wit
In that nook I found you
So old and tired
Would you be the one to carry me?
I'd like to be someone
You could finally learn to love again Made our iron bed side
Cold as graves
So we stoke the organs
That may comfort grace
And they conjured spirits
To make you smile
Would you be my long time baby? I'd like to be someone
You could finally learn to
Breathe
At our sides
Let's take the time
To mend these smiles
To get them
Could make it home
Love is surprises
Live our own lives In our beds we're the lucky ones
Filled with the sun
In our beds we're the lucky ones
Fill us with the sun You and me with our long hair on the gold one
After midnight we could feel it all
I go anywhere you want to You should see there's a place I want to take you
When the train comes I will hold you
Cause you blow my mind On the bridge levitating cause we want to
When the unknown will surround you
There is no right time
There is no right time The branches of the trees
They will hang lower now
You will grow too quick
Then you will get through it The branches of the trees
They will hang lower now There's a place I want to take you
When the unknown will surround you Stand beside it
We can't hide the way it makes us glow
It's no good unless it grows
Feel this burning love of mine Deep inside the ever-spinning
Tell me, does it feel?
It's no good unless it's real
Hillsides burning, wild-eyed turning
Till we're running from it I'd take care of you
If you'd ask me to
In a year or two
Oh You say swimming in the lake
We'll come across a snake
It is real and then it's fake
Feel its heartbeat
Feel what you heat
Far so fast it feels too late I'd take care of you
If you'd ask me to
In a year or two
Oh I'd take care of you
Take care of you, that's true
Oh, I'd take care of you
Take care of you, that's true
Oh, I'd take care of you
Take care of you, that's true
Oh, I'd take care of you
Take care of you, that's true
Oh, I'd take care of you
Take care of you, that's true
Oh, I'd take care of you
Take care of you, that's true
Oh, I'd take care of you
Take care of you, that's true
Oh, I'd take care of you
Take care of you, that's true
Oh, I'd take care of you
Take care of you, that's true
Oh, I'd take care of you
Take care of you, that's true
Oh, I'd take care of you
Take care of you, that's true Invite your sister
Into the garden
All cannot play
Fist full of wild flowers
Hand picked by someone
Who nearly fell (ahhh, ahhh) Friend foe or feather
If we roll together
Give my gift to you
In all kinds of weather
If not now not ever
Please do not go Hands over your eyes
Recalling your size
Is it the right time
For the game we play
In all kinds of weather
If not now not ever
This is the right time
For a holiday (la, la, la, la) You came to me
In my dreams
And you spoke of everything
Sweeter than the days that I was breathing
How on earth did anything... Hello
You're humming tomorrow's never songs
But you're singing the only words you know
Would you cry, if I lied, on the dam I chose, yeah
You're ringing the only wedding bell
And we're swimming the seas we've known so well
I've tried, to stay alive, in our bed, in our heads
Oh, but your wish is my command Ahhh, is your heart still mine to save?
I
enjoy
nothing
ahhh I chose, yeah
You're ringing the only wedding bell
And we're swimming the seas we've known so well
I've tried, to stay alive, in our bed, in our heads
Oh, but your wish is my command We drive around this town
Houses melting down
A vision turning green
Is all we've ever seen
And then it's dark again
A new development
Wishing that it meant
Something natural
Don't we know it's cruel
And it goes dark again
Just like a spark Hallucination comes
Think of everyone
That never shared before
From my mouth to yours
And then it's dark again
Just like a spark
And then it vanishes
No one around
And then it comes again
Just like a spark
And then we're vanishing
No one around
And then it comes again
Just like a spark You go to school, you follow all the rules, you live inside
Realize there's something in your eyes, you're back again
From the spine rising through the mind, you give it up
(Just like a spark)
It's a gift taken from the lips, you live again Make it
Wave it
Alive
Make it
Wave it
Alive Imitation red carnation
Nothing is new and either are you It's what you say you don't do
Bottom of your well, that's where you fell Majorette like there's nothing left
If there was nothing left to lose
Then you'd have something to prove And you would never tip your hat
Has it come to that
Watch it spin like that Watch you spin like that Hush don't you cry
In the next life
She takes me to the water
Don't say a word And when I ask her
Is she doing alright
She's a rollercoaster
And yeah, she's a fire in the night Lay your dead flowers
All in a row
Sooner or later
We're gonna let them go And when she asks me
Are we doing it right
Come a little closer
You've got nothing left to hide Hush don't you cry
In the next life And when they ask us
Are we happy inside
We're a rollercoaster
And yeah, we're a fire in the night What can you say
All your yeahs
It's your life
Do you right
Give them love All your yeahs
What can you say
All your yeahs
It's your life
Do you right
Give them love
And give them away Down the hill I'd hoped that I'd find
Something I could rest my hands on
In the distance sun is setting
Feel I'm jumping over hedges By the dock of the pond Turtle Island
I will wait for you there creeping silently
I can keep you right behind me all my days in the... In the waters tracing features
Did they scare hardened creatures?
In that murky green reflection
Did they warn you of dissection? How? What? Why? When? By the dock of the pond Turtle Island
I will wait for you there creeping silently
I can keep you right behind me all my days in the... How I want Olive (our love?) to know
That inside me she will always grow
In all colors and sizes
You will always remain By the dock of the pond Turtle Island
By the dock of the pond Turtle Island
I can keep you right behind me all my days in the sun In a dark winter Tokyo
In the Majong waters he wades
Seven pasts thrumming through his heads
Though he comes to the water ways In the hallways they lie in bed
Dream the red loss of all their days
In your arms there is nothing left
But we are all on the way My whole life
Is the mystery
That I can't bear Oh wings
That are camery
Upon this day I would love to heal you now In a dark winter Tokyo
In the Mahjong waters they wade
Severed pasts sweeping through their hands
No one comes to the water way In the hour of the all
There is notes along the way All I wanted to see
Is that I am better
All I want to believe
Is that I am better
Round and round
All I wanted to see
Is that I am better
round and round I want you
To know the truth
'Cause I've
Been around before
Thought I
Wasn't looking anymore Been a fool for weeks
'Cause my heart stands for nothing
And your soul's too weak
Got a will
That's been around for days
Goes far if you want it
It needs to behave
But then you
You come around
Big mistake I don't want to know
I don't want to know
We don't need a sign to know
Better times Running around 'cause you beat yourself up
'Cause you made a crack and the one that you love is gone
How much longer can you play with fire
Before you turn into a liar, huh? Running around 'cause you beat yourself up
'Cause you made a crack and the one that you love is gone
How much longer can you play with fire
Before you turn into a liar, huh? I've been around before
Thought you weren't looking anymore
But then we
We come and go
Go up in smoke I don't want to know
I don't want to know
We don't need a sign to know
Better times You only give me
What you don't want no more
Ask the questions
That you don't know at all Let's lie down for awhile
You can smile
Lay your head in the old
Old fashion You know how it is my friend
In the boxes of those picture frames
Hold your inside cause you're cold at night
Warm your heart, love, cause you're by my side Lay your head in the
Apple orchard
Take your time
You can settle down
Hold your breath
Cause you're, you are nothing
Hold your head on me
For a while The roses on the lawn
don't know wich side you're on
in a daze, it will change
wishes on a wheel
wishes on a wheel. The voices in the hall
will carry on their talking
carry weight you can't take
wishes on a wheel
is it even real? The contact that you make
the moment when a memory aches
who can tell you do it well
wishes on a wheel
How's it supposed to feel? One in your life
it happens once and rarely twice
One in your life
it happens once and rarely twice. The roses on the lawn
won't know which side you're on
on that hill, forever still
wishes on a wheel
How's it supposed to feel? Wishes on a wheel
wishes on a wheel. Home again, driven back
She's still waiting for a friend Little purple organdy,
Remember what you've always meant to me Something in the way your heart is nailed upon a hand
Swimming in the cold waters, head above the sand Heaven, baby, is in an hour
With your heart in handfuls, forbidden flowers
Bread and bonnets along the way
Better take your chances while there's still a ray Something in the way your heart is nailed upon a hand
Swimming in the cold waters, head above the sand Constant heart of my devotion
Must be you, the door to open
Home again, be here, be with him
Will I swim out of your ocean? Constant heart of my devotion
Must be you, the door to open
Home again, be here, be with him
Will I swim out of your ocean? Constant heart of my devotion
Must be you, the door to open
Home again, be here, be with him
Will I swim out of your ocean? We were sleeping till
You came along
With your tiny heart
You let us in the wooden house
To share in all the wealth Don't you know it's true?
Norway-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Norway-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay Seven figures leap the hungry mouths
The beast, he comes to you
He's a hunter for a lonely heart
In the season of the sun Don't you know it's true?
Norway-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Norway-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay Where you thinking that you gotta run to now
With the beating of a tiny heart?
Hang on to the things that you're supposed to say
Millions of stars, they open to your fate Norway... Like a hand you reached out to me
The thunder rolls in with the dark
Tiny fingers on the edges
Watch it unravel pulling everything apart In the night we stay together
The walls are shaking from within
Does it become you troublemaker
Watch them unravel you
Pulling everything apart Some day out of the blue it will find you
Always
Always a face to remind me
Someone like you
Someone like you
Someone like you You watch the shape these things are taking
Do you cry out in your sleep
Does it become you when you're under
Your heart is racing you're taking everything too hard When you walk away
You show me how
Come pull me under Some day out of the blue it will find you
Always
Always a face to remind me
Someone like you
Someone like you
Someone like you Someday out of the blue it will find you
Always
Always a face to remind you Compositor: Alex Scally / Victoria Legrand Man, you got a lot of jokes to tell
So you throw your baby's pennies down the well
Give a little more than you like
Pick apart the past, you're not going back
Don't you waste your time
No, oh, oh, oh
Gila-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a-a-a
Sure, you've got a handle on the past
It's why you keep your little lovers in your lap
Give a little more than you like
Pick apart the past, you're not going back
So don't you waste your time
No, oh, oh, oh
Gila-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a-a-a
Hoping for the last ship to arrive
I am blessed with a kingdom, half mine.
Gila-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a-a You used to live in this part of town
Until you hit the ground
She makes movies where she cries on cue
She still lives downtown But it's ok
Cause she's common anyway
And the streets are all filled
With the strangers, pay the bills She's the one with the lazy eye
Promises never come filled
Takes the pills and hides the notices
Cartoon rings of ill will But it's ok
Cause she's common in every way
And the streets are all filled
With the strangers, pay the bills Nobody special done a good thing
For somebody else
Taking advantage of that good thing
For nobody else In the night I called your
Name - heart of mine
One letter at a time.
I'll be found in a
Land of savages
Ah-h... Maybe you
Don't know what you've got,
Spent yer money on
Desert lots -
Holy dances and acronyms
For her. Bury your maps, they'll find
All you pots and pans
Cross all your hands, one
Finger at a time
You'll be found in a
Land of savages ah-h... Maybe you don't know what
You've got,
Husk to hide and I know you're
Not, spending money
On a desert rose -
Holy dances and acronyms
For bones. My mother said to me that I would get in trouble
Our father won't come home, cause he is seeing double Out in the endless green, your eyes are so misleading
That's when your car pulls up, it's hood is black and gleaming And in a while
You start a smile
The earth is wild
You've got no time Wild in our ways
What we are making
Heartless to say
Go on pretending Wild in our ways
What we are making
Heartless to say
You go, go on pretending One chance to fall behind the lines that would not let you
Can I believe in how the past is what will catch you And in a while
You start a smile
The earth is wild
You've got no time Wild in our ways
What we are making
Heartless to say
Go on pretending Wild in our ways
What we are making
Heartless to say
You go, go on pretending Wild in our ways
Go on pretending When I come home
You're just lying there
Face against the wall
Never had a care I am just a traveller
There's no light in this room
And the body's aching at night Would I be acting up
If i said it's not enough Who knows who else who is with
No one is with the traveller
There's a light in my eyes
And a future invisible now Heard it's your birthday
Candles in a row
Better blow them quick
Before they're melting on the floor You were never a traveller
There's no light in your room
And the bodies don't ache in the night Would I be acting up
If i said not that much Who else would do anything for the traveller
There's a light in her eyes
And a future visible touch I was looking out of the window at the sky
Starless vigil of a life that has gone by
Saturn turning and I feel there's not much more
For a vision of the night turn off your light Pink and blue were dancing
Empty floor, shadows lancing
Somewhere in a ballroom tonight Red and blue combination
Old man finds elation
Somewhere in a ballroom tonight Love me, see what I see tonight
Let us find elation
Somewhere in a ballroom tonight
Nowhere on an ordinary night One thing yea about you
You always yea you always know
What's happening
Perfect in the morning
And you ruin it in the evening Remarkable
When a likeness comes
You're lucky just to meet
Come down the hill
And up the stairs
She never really sleeps Closer now in the mirror
Your reflection, my reflection
Growing nearer
Pressure oh the pressure
In confession Hallelujah Remarkable
When a likeness comes
You're always out of reach
The faces in the secondhand
A little fuck off kiss Remarkable
That you're lucky just to meet
Come down the hill
Cause she never really sleeps A sunny day in their chariot
Were they waving back to you? Losing touch, not that much
She was running back to you, to you
No more But you said that your sweet time is spent
Nobody knows how close it will come
The right of the sands
My heart in your hands
Women chasers, the wives abide
You build a plane to take a land you divide A sunny day in their chariot
Were they waving back to you? The way you chased her, the Cadillac
Back on the coastline with the sun on his back
Women chasers, a scarlet lamp
He will be taken, but they'll all love him back A sunny day in their chariot
Were they waving back to you? One last call
One last call Long days of wanting you here
Living in fear
Shedding a tear for you Long nights of pasty face tunes
Echo in rooms
Filling with gloom for me Letters so hard to mail
Feeling like the wind from the sea Now I step into the line
Girl on the
In all the world than you There's nothing lovelier, girl
In all the world than making love to you Letters so hard to mail
Feeling like the wind from the sea Lately got to thinking that
How I long to have you here with me All I wanted comes in colors
Vanish everyday
I keep these promises, these promises
Stranger things will come before you
Always out of the way
We keep these promises, these promises Can you call it? See it coming?
Just enough to tell a story 'bout a
Portrait of a young girl waiting
For a new year All you ever wanted
Is it getting away?
Visions of a feeling
The footsteps at bay You were getting stronger
Memories again
Now you're open wider
It's better this way All I wanted comes in colors
Vanish everyday
I keep these promises, these promises
Stranger things will come before you
Always out of the way
We keep these promises, these promises Won't you write a letter
On the page in your own way
Write it in a letter
On the page, it's your own way You were getting wiser
It's better this way
Faces in the mirror
Memories again Now look to a feeling
It's lighter than breath
All you ever wanted
Is it getting away? Can you call it? See it coming?
Just enough to tell a story 'bout a
Portrait of a young girl waiting
For the ending of an era Can you call it? See it coming?
Just enough to tell a story 'bout a
Portrait of a young girl waiting
For the new year Pay no mind
It takes time
What's that you say Down the hall
I heard a song
Who knows
Drifting away Baby at night when I look at you
Nothing in this world keeps me confused
All it takes, look in your eyes All of me
Is to tow the waste
What's that you say
It's going away It's painful but
You do what you must
Takes time to know Baby at night when I look at you
Nothing in this world keeps me confused
All it takes, look in your eyes Who knows if there're roses in heaven
Let go of that empty feeling
Not dumber just a little bit older
Kiss of love couldn't be much colder No better color
Look everywhere
We're driving home every night
The shadows stay by your side You built a city
All in your head
Triangle of every light
It turns you on every night Need a companion
My head in prayer
You know you're not losing your mind
What's left you make something of it
Sky what's left above it
The way you want nothing of it
Baby I'm yours No better color
Look everywhere
You built a city
All in your head
You know you're not losing your mind
What's left you make something of it
Sky what's left above it
The way you want nothing of it
Wildflower beginning of the end
thought the harvest was my friend
the nature of that place
sends a sweet smell around my head
oh well
the hardest thing of all
the harboring of our lost
hiding all the time
we were cast out of everywhere
but not
last time
the last time i remember
the last time i remember
it was gone
how i want you know
how far else we will go
hand in hand let it low
all of our days in the slow
all our toys are dead
unraveled at the stairs
opened but who cares
whyyyyyyyyy Love you all the time
Even though you're not mine
Love you all the time
Dream I'm in the saltwater Timing's gone all bad
Broken faith and a broken way
You couldn't lose me if you tried
Cause I'll be rolling to your side, baby Love you all the time
Even though you're not mine
Love you all the time
Broken faith and a broken way You couldn't lose me if you tried I was sitting on a rock, just
waiting for a key
to sleep inside the house
of old serenity So I climbed onto your altar
begged, please don't let me falter,
we'll put our oaths at stake
in a heaven that all icicles make. All my devotion,
compelled by an ocean,
of all the years to come
of all the years to come So we'll work until the night is quite
what once all our dreams were like;
doing all the housework, returning all the
schoolbooks, for good Let's go on pretending that the light
is neverending -
we still have the summers
to be good to one another, yay hey Clouds part
She's rolling down the water
But it always rains And we'll hold you
The rest of your life In your lace
Were you lazy?
Always counting
A first time She's rolling down the window
But it always rains And we'll hold you
The rest of your life Spend your money
Acting funny
Get yourselves
In the hallroom She's rolling down the window
But it's always raining
But it's always raining your picture
is still
on my wall
on my wall
the colors are bright
bright as ever
the red is strong
the blue is true
some things last a long time
some things last a long time your picture
is still
on my wall
on my wall
I think
about you
often
often
I can't forget all the things we did
some things last a long time
some things last a long time it's funny
but it's true
and it's true
but it's not funny
time comes and goes
all the while
I still think of you
some things last a long time your picture
is still
on my wall
on my wall
the colors
are bright
bright
as ever
things that we did
all we forget
some things last a life time
some things last a life time Come over to my house
I'll pour some tea for us
one sugar or two
Your hand is right in front of me,
your finger fragilely, holy on
my side Faster than an astronaut
Who's coming home to what
He left long ago
I've made this brand new bed for
You, I trust the things we do,
Holy or not Open the gate cause you're already late,
at the end of the lane, is a glass of
Lemona-ade, keep or the path when
you hear the laugh, in the white of her
Palm is your heart! I'll be brave for a while
I won't bring you down
anymore than you are Please, be my baby, don't mean
maybe or not, look out the
window, there's a bright
yellow cat... Where did you come from?
You're no stranger
How I'll know you will return
So I won't be sad D.A.R.L.I.N.G. In this harbor of a room
You'll find your anchor soon
In the parting of our ways
May it never happen, anyway In the highest blackened moon
There'd be more life
In the right shade of our sighs
Death, be gone D.A.R.L.I.N.G. In this harbor of a room
You'll find your anchor soon
In the parting of our ways
May it never happen, anyway Love, it comes up
On the ceiling
My mouth
And these arms
Hold the feeling Even I
Can't control
My nature If there should come
A match before you
I would not ever
Try to capture you Bluebird, where you gonna go now? We flee to
The gallows
Then I
Caught up my eye
There's something Its boat
Led me back
From nothing
From nothing If there should come
A match before you
I would not ever
Try to capture you Bluebird, where you gonna go now? Things change
Before they are over
Before they are over Snowflakes that fall across my eye
Cannot compare to a dumb surprise
new becomes all
What's all is new
When I first layed my eyes on you I do not care for the winter sun
Windows and fires all they preach you, all
It doesn't matter
This time of year
Thou darkness come
so quick in time
shortens our days
To longer nights Build a blue fire and leave this sign
Snowflakes that fall across our eyes
It's all that matters
This time of year
It's all that matters
This time of year 
 Once when I saw her there
White light, she stood so still
Warming her eyes to the sea
Hardly her way to be free Auburn and ivory
Heart break and pony tails Holding her bones by the fire
Writing the letter, she sails
White page turns golder lights
Wanting her one sacrifice Come to me and
I'll tell you what's wrong
She said, "I'll wait for you
I'll wait for..." Once when I saw her there
White light she stood so still
White page turns golder lights
Hardly her one sacrifice Silhouette that comes to me,
as your state of infinity.
Even in your equal mind,
you were passing through this time.
Delicate with no defense,
honor what you love to no end.
Perfection in the accident,
truly yours is just what I meant. Equal mind
Equal mind 
Equal mind  There is no way you could know,
these waves they come and they go.
In blooms they're chasing the lights,
too soon say these goodbyes. Equal mind
Equal mind 
Equal mind  You were bad before you left a good life
To chase the palm trees swaying in the light
Do you say what you mean
You are only sixteen
And it goes
And it goes Know that you're really not a dancer
But could it be the other people's smiles
They are two faced in the mirror
No vacation from here
And you go
And you go The arrangement of lies
In a party of smiles
Make a good one, do it right
The arrangement of lies Know that you're really not a dancer
But could it be the other people's smiles
So you make a choice to leave the good life
To chase the palm trees swaying in the night
What you see in your mind
Look outside in dark light
And you go
And it goes The arrangement of lies
In a party of smiles
Make a good one, do it right
The arrangement of lies I was looking
For a four leaf clover
Why snakes play
Summer's ford
That got powder
Out on my own
Out on my own Why giggle manners
Light just don't matter
Out on my own
Out on my own Why it turns backwards
Out on my own
Out on my own She's so lovely
Everything about her
Mannerisms of another Castles in the sand
Money in your hand
And all I have to do
Is everything for you From the way that her eyes are shaped
It's making me sick With her head on my shoulder
Waking up barely just to believe For her dinner
Baby pink lavender
Leather white umbrella sinner She's so lovely
Everything about her
Mannerisms of another Castles in the sand
Money in your hand
And all I have to do
Is stay away from you The heart is a stone, and this is a stone that we throw
Put your hand on this stone, it's the stone of a home you know
They say we will go far, but they don't know how far we'll go
With our legs on the edge and our feet on the horizon They say we can throw far, but they don't know how far we throw
With our legs on the edge and our feet on the horizon
The heart is a stone, and this is a stone that we throw
They say we will go far, but they don't know how far we'll go It can't be gone
We're still right here
It took so long
Can't say we heard it all
Limbs parallel
We stood so long, we fell
Tear a moment from the days
That carry us on forever This push and pull is the force of a wave of time
In the heat of a night we would cry, you are not mine
They said we would go far, but they didn't know how far we'd go
'Cause this heart is a stone, and this is a stone that we throw It can't be gone
We're still right here
It took so long
Can't say we saw it all
Limbs parallel
We stood so long, we fell
Bright pyramids at night
That carry us on forever It can't be gone
We're still right here
It took so long
Can't say we felt it all
Limbs parallel
We stood so long, we fell
Love's like a pantheon
It carries on forever The kind you like
To come back in
Wherever you go No hawk inside
The sea will dry
The sun's just set The brightened lines
Stick by your side
Wherever you go The kind you like
All come back in
They told you so Wherever you go
No doubt it's true
The light's off Wherever you go
No doubt it's true The kind you like
No end in sight
The rest you know Open up your mind and let me step inside.
Rest your weary head and let your heart decide.
It's so easy, when you know the rules.
It's so easy, all you have to do is fall in love. Play the game, ev'rybody play, play the game of love. When you're feelin' down and your resistance is low,
light another cigarette and let yourself go.
This is your life, don't play hard to get.
It's a free world, all you have to do is fall in love. Play the game, ev'rybody play, play the game. Love runs from my head down to my toes.
My love is pumping through my veins.
Driving me insane. Play the game, ev'rybody play, play the game of love. This is your life, don't play hard to get.
It's a free, free world, all you have to do is fall in love. Play the game, ev'rybody play, play the game of love. Out on the sea, we'd be forgiven
Our bodies stopped the spirit living
Wouldn't you like to know
How far you've got left to go? Somebody's child, nobody made you
It's not what you stole, it's what they gave you
In or out you go
In your silence, your soul Would you rather go unwilling?
Your heart is full and now it's spilling
Barreling down the steps
Only a moment left In hind of sight, no peace of mind
Where you begin and I'm defined
Daughter of unconscious fate
Time will tell in spite of me In hind of sight, no peace of mind
Where it begins and we're defined
Shadows bend and suddenly
The world becomes and swallows me in Whistle to a friend gentle till the end
Anyway in a name she takes shape just the same You think of tomorrow
The things you'll get done
Your family's a portrait
When spaces come down
She says she will meet you when
It's quite passable
No time like the evening
The baseball diamond
Oh You can't find your ticket
The hands in the air
So while it's a foul ball
The children won't care
She sits smiling next to you
The sun on the edge
The circle awaits the calm
When he comes to pitch
No hands like the evening
I want you to win
I feel like it's coming
The second steal in She sits like the season
The sun washes in
A break in the clouds
No time like to win
No time like tomorrow
The baseball diamond Playmakers waiting for the sun to come down
Playmakers waiting for the sun to come down
Playmakers waiting for the sun
Playmakers waiting for the sun Baby's having such fun
Baby thinks he's the one
One and only exception
He'll go down the rest of them April comes for one more May
The floor is swept, the clothes are put away
That's a day Have you heard news?
Baby had to choose
Now he's on the wall
Can you make a judgement call? April comes for one more May
The floor is swept, the clothes are put away
And that's a day Down the hill I looked so fast
Feel the moon, it doesn't last
Troubled boy and lucky girl
Bring me back into your world Call your name when you are gone
Longest night before the dawn
Hard to catch this side of you
Do you want me two on two? White moon beam on my back
White moon beam on my back
White moon beam on my back
White moon beam on my back Feel inside, it's part of you
An animal that is confused
Hard to catch this side of you
Do you want me to want you? Give you half but you want more
Bring me back into your world
Feel inside, it's part of you
An animal that is confused White moon beam on my back
White moon beam on my back
White moon beam on my back
White moon beam on my back Shadow in the night
I cannot promise you
No one knows where we don't go
They never do Sing to me goodbyes
The night, a soft disguise
The debt is not due
The debt is not due Shadow in the night
I cannot promise you
No one knows where we don't go
They never do Sing to me goodbyes
The night, a soft disguise
The debt is not due
The debt is not due Shifting dreams, not what it seems
It never is
The sun will always rise
It says, it promises Shifting dreams, not what it seems
It's never true
No one knows where we will go
They never do Chances are like night disappeared
Caught in the atmosphere
Where you go, she casts no shadow
Still you know she's near Lie
Lie Here she comes, all parts of everything
Stars in the motherhand
With the dark, thunder above you
Come to a song, we... Lie
Lie Chances are
10: 37
House made of the dawn
Disappears Lie
Lie

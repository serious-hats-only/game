Your everlasting summer, you can see it fading fast
So you grab a piece of something that you think is gonna last
Well, you wouldn't even know a diamond if you held it in your hand
The things you think are precious, I can't understand Are you reelin' in the years? Stowin' away the time
Are you gatherin' up the tears? Have you had enough of mine?
Are you reelin' in the years? Stowin' away the time
Are you gatherin' up the tears? Have you had enough of mine? You been tellin' me you're a genius since you were seventeen
In all the time I've known you, I still don't know what you mean
The weekend in the college didn't turn out like you planned
The things that pass for knowledge, I can't understand Are you reelin' in the years? Stowin' away the time
Are you gatherin' up the tears? Have you had enough of mine?
Are you reelin' in the years? Stowin' away the time
Are you gatherin' up the tears? Have you had enough of mine? I spent a lot of money and I spent a lot of time
The trip we made to Hollywood is etched upon my mind
After all the things we've done and seen, you find another man
The things you think are useless, I can't understand Are you reelin' in the years? Stowin' away the time
Are you gatherin' up the tears? Have you had enough of mine?
Are you reelin' in the years? Stowin' away the time
Are you gatherin' up the tears? Have you had enough of mine? I've seen your picture
Your name in lights above it
This is your big debut
It's like a dream come true
So won't you smile for the camera?
I know they're gonna love it

It's your favorite foreign movie This is the day of the expanding man
That shape is my shade
There where I used to stand
It seems like only yesterday
I gazed through the glass
At ramblers, wild gamblers
That's all in the past You call me a fool
You say it's a crazy scheme
This one's for real
I already bought the dream
So useless to ask me why
Throw a kiss and say goodbye
I'll make it this time
I'm ready to cross that fine line Learn to work the saxophone
(I) I play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whiskey all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
(I) I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues
(Deacon Blues) My back to the wall
A victim of laughing chance
This is for me
The essence of true romance
Sharing the things we know and love with those of my kind
Libations, sensations
That stagger the mind I crawl like a viper
Through these suburban streets
Make love to these women
Languid and bittersweet
I'll rise when the sun goes down
Cover every game in town
A world of my own
I'll make it my home sweet home Learn to work the saxophone
(I) I play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whiskey all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
(I) I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues
(Deacon Blues) This is the night of the expanding man
I take one last drag as I approach the stand
I cried when I wrote this song
Sue me if I play too long
This brother is free
I'll be what I want to be I'll learn to work the saxophone
(I) I play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whiskey all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
(I) I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues
(Deacon Blues) Times are hard
You're afraid to pay the fee
So you find yourself somebody
Who can do the job for free
When you need a bit of lovin'
'Cause your man is out of town
That's the time you get me runnin'
And you know I'll be around I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
I don't wanna do your dirty work, no more
I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah Light the candle
Put the lock upon the door
You have sent the maid home early
Like a thousand times before
Like the castle in its corner
In a medieval game
I foresee terrible trouble
And I stay here just the same I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah
I don't wanna do your dirty work, no more
I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah I'm a fool to do your dirty work, oh yeah

Hey nineteen

(no we can't talk at all)
Please take me along when you slide on down
Hey nineteen
That's 'Retha Franklin

She thinks I'm crazy but I'm just growing old
Hey nineteen

Please take me along when you slide on down

(no we can't talk at all) In the morning you go gunning
For the man who stole your water
And you fire till he is done in
But they catch you at the border
And the mourners are all singing
As they drag you by your feet
But the hangman isn't hanging
And they put you on the street, yeah You go back, Jack
Do it again
Wheel turnin' round and round
You go back, Jack
Do it again When you know she's no high climber
Then you find your only friend
In a room with your two timer
And you're sure you're near the end
Then you love a little wild one
And she brings you only sorrow
All the time you know she's smiling
You'll be on your knees tomorrow, yeah You go back, Jack
Do it again
Wheel turnin' round and round
You go back, Jack
Do it again Now you swear and kick and beg us
That you're not a gambling man
Then you find you're back in Vegas
With a handle in your hand
Your black cards can make you money
So you hide them when you're able
In the land of milk and honey
You must put them on the table, yeah You go back, Jack
Do it again
Wheel turnin' round and round
You go back, Jack
Do it again While the poor people sleepin'
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin'
All the stars come out at night While the poor people sleepin'
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin'
All the stars come out at night After closing time
At the guernsey fair
I detect the el supremo
From the room at the top of the stairs Well I've been around the world
And I've been in the Washington Zoo
And in all my travels as the facts unravel
I've found this to be true While the poor people sleepin'
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin'
All the stars come out at night While the poor people sleepin'
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin'
All the stars come out at night They got the house on the corner
With the rug inside
They got the booze they need
All that money can buy They got the shapely bodys
They got the Steely Dan T-Shirt
And for the coup-de-gras
They? re outrageous Honey, let the girl you
While the poor people sleepin'
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin'
All the stars come out at night While the poor people sleepin'

Are you reelin' in the years? Stowin' away the time
Are you gatherin' up the tears? Have you had enough of mine? I remember the thirty-five sweet goodbyes
When you put me on the Wolverine
Up to Annandale
It was still September
When your daddy was quite surprised
To find you with the working girls
In the county jail
I was smoking with the boys upstairs
When I heard about the whole affair
I said, whoa no
William and Mary won't do now Well, I did not think the girl
Could be so cruel
And I'm never going back
To my old school Oleanders growing outside her door
Soon they're gonna be in bloom
Up in Annandale
I can't stand her
Doing what she did before
Living like a gypsy queen
In a fairy tale
Well, I hear the whistle but I can't go
I'm gonna take her down to Mexico
She said, whoa no
Guadalajara won't do now Well, I did not think the girl
Could be so cruel
And I'm never going back
To my old school California tumbles into the sea
That'll be the day I go
Back to Annandale
Tried to warn you
About Chino and Daddy Gee
But I can't seem to get to you
Through the U.S. Mail
Well, I hear the whistle but I can't go
I'm gonna take her down to Mexico
She said, whoa no
Guadalajara won't do now Well, I did not think the girl
Could be so cruel
And I'm never going back
To my old school While the music played
You worked by candlelight
Those San Francisco nights
You were the best in town Just by chance you crossed the diamond with the pearl
You turned it on the world
That's when you turned the world around Did you feel like Jesus?
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes On the hill the stuff was laced with kerosene
But yours was kitchen clean
Everyone stopped to stare at your technicolor motorhome Every A frame had your number on the wall
You must have had it all
You'd go to L.A. on a dare and you'd go it alone Could you live forever?
Could you see the day?
Could you feel your whole world fall apart and fade away? Get along get along Kid Charlemagne
Get along Kid Charlemagne Now your patrons have all left you in the red
Your low rent friends are dead
This life can be very strange All those day glo freaks who used to paint their face
They've joined the human race
Some things will never change Son you were mistaken
You are obsolete
Look at all the white men on the street
Get along get along Kid Charlemagne
Get along Kid Charlemagne
Clean this mess up else we'll all end up in jail
Those test tubes and the scale
Just get it all outta here
Is there gas in the car?
Yes there's gas in the car
I think the people down the hall know who you are
Careful what you carry
'Cause the man is wise
You are still an outlaw in their eyes
Get along get along get along Kid Charlemagne
Get along get along Kid Charlemagne Worry the bottle Mama
It's grapefruit wine
Kick off your high heel sneakers
It's party time
The girls don't seem to care what's on
As long as they play till dawn
Nothin' but blues and Elvis
And somebody elses' favorite song Give her some funked up music
She treats you nice
Feed her some hungry reggae
She'll love you twice
The girls don't seem to care tonight
As long as the mood is right No static at all
(no static, no static at all)
F.M.
(no static at all)
Give her some funked up music
She treats you nice
Feed her some hungry reggae
She'll love you twice
The girls don't seem to care tonight
As long as the mood is right
No static at all
(no static, no static at all)
F.M.
(no static at all) We hear you're leavin'
That's okay
I thought our little wild time
Had just begun I guessed you kind of scared yourself
You turn and run
But if you have a change of heart
Rikki don't lose that number You don't wanna call nobody else
Send it off in a letter to yourself
Rikki don't lose that number It's the only one you own
You might use it if you feel better
When you get home I have a friend in town
He's heard your name
We can go out driving on
Slow hand row We could stay inside and play games
I don't know
And you could have a change of heart
Rikki don't lose that number You don't wanna call nobody else
Send it off in a letter to yourself
Rikki don't lose that number It's the only one you own
You might use it if you feel better
When you get home You tell yourself you're not my kind
But you don't even know your mind
And you could have a change of heart
Rikki don't lose that number You don't wanna call nobody else
Send it off in a letter to yourself
Rikki don't lose that number It's the only one you own
You might use it if you feel better
When you get home
Rikki don't lose that number
Rikki don't lose that number
Rikki don't lose that number I was grinding through my day gig
Stackin' cutouts at the Strand
When in walks Franny from NYU
We were quite an item back then
We talked about her films and shows and CDs
And I don't know what else
She said, yeah, Hollywood's been good to me
But tell me - how about yourself CHORUS:
I'm still working on that novel
But I'm just about to quit
'Cause I'm worrying about the future now
Or maybe this is it
It's not all that I thought it would be
What a shame about me She said, talk to me, do you ever see
Anybody else from our old crew
Bobby Dakine won the Bunsen Prize
Now he's coming out with something new
Alan owns a chain of Steamer Heavens
And Barry is the software king
And somebody told me in the early 80's
You were gonna be the Next Big Thing CHORUS:
Well now that was just a rumor
But I guess I'm doin' fine
Three weeks out of the rehab
Living one day at a time
Sneaking up on the new century
What a shame about me What a shame about me
I'm thinking of a major Jane Street sunrise
And the goddess on the fire escape was you We both ran out of small talk
The connection seemed to go dead
I was about to say, hey, have a nice life
When she touched my hand and said:
You know I just had this great idea
This could be very cool
Why don't we grab a cab to my hotel
And make believe we're back at our old school CHORUS:
I said babe you look delicious
And you're standing very close
But like this is Lower Broadway
And you're talking to a ghost
Take a good look it's easy to see
What a shame about me
What a shame about me Up on the hill
People never stare
They just don't care
Chinese music under banyan trees
Here at the dude ranch above the sea
Aja
When all my dime dancin' is through
I run to you Up on the hill
They've got time to burn
There's no return
Double helix in the sky tonight
Throw out the hardware
Let's do it right
Aja
When all my dime dancin' is through
I run to you Up on the hill
They think I'm okay
Or so they say
Chinese music always sets me free
Angular banjoes
Sound good to me
Aja
When all my dime dancin' is through
I run to you Standing tough under stars and stripes
We can tell
This dream's in sight
You've got to admit it
At this point in time that it's clear
The future looks bright
On that train all graphite and glitter
Undersea by rail
Ninety minutes from new york to paris
Well by seventy-six we'll be a.o.k. What a beautiful world this will be
What a glorious time to be free Get your ticket to that wheel in space
While there's time
The fix is in
You'll be a witness to that game of chance in the sky
You know we've got to win
Here at home we'll play in the city
Powered by the sun
Perfect weather for a streamlined world
There'll be spandex jackets one for everyone What a beautiful world this will be
What a glorious time to be free On that train all graphite and glitter
Undersea by rail
Ninety minutes from new york to paris
(more leisure for artists everywhere)
A just machine to make big decisions
Programmed by fellows with compassion and vision
We'll be clean when their work is done
We'll be eternally free yes and eternally young What a beautiful world this will be
What a glorious time to be free I would love to tour the Southland
In a traveling minstrel show
Yes I'd love to tour the Southland
In a traveling minstrel show Yes, I'm dying to be a star and make them laugh
Sound just like a record on the phonograph
Those days are gone forever
Over a long time ago, oh yeah
Hey hey I have never met Napoleon
But I plan to find the time
I have never met Napoleon
But I plan to find the time, yes I do 'Cause he looks so fine upon that hill
They tell me he was lonely, he's lonely still
Those days are gone forever
Over a long time ago, oh yeah I stepped up on the platform
The man gave me the news
He said, you must be joking son
Where did you get those shoes?
Where did you get those shoes? Well, I've seen 'em on the TV, the movie show
They say the times are changing but I just don't know
These things are gone forever
Over a long time ago, oh yeah Oh yeah Hey hey All right, all right In the corner
Of my eye
I saw you in Rudy's
You were very high You were high
It was a cryin' disgrace
They saw your face On the counter
By your keys
Was a book of numbers
And your remedies One of these
Surely will screen out of sorrow
But where are you tomorrow I can't cry anymore
While you run around
(while you run around)
Break away
Just when it seems so clear
That it's over now
Drink your big black cow
And get out of here Down to green street
There you go
Lookin' so outrageous
And they tell you so You should know
How all the pros play the game
You change your name Like a gangster
On the run
You will stagger homeward
To your precious one I'm the one
Who must make everything right
Talk it out till daylight I don't care anymore
Why you run around
(why you run around)
Break away
Just when it seems so clear
That it's over now
Drink your big black cow
And get out of here I can't cry anymore
While you run around
(while you run around)
Break away
Just when it seems so clear
That it's over now
Drink your big black cow
And get out of here So outrageous
So outrageous
So outrageous I've got a girl and Ruby is her name
(Ruby, Ruby, Ruby baby)
She don't love me but I love her just the same
(Ruby, Ruby, Ruby baby) Ruby, Ruby, how I want you
Like a ghost, I'm gonna haunt you
Ruby, Ruby when will you be mine? Each time, I see you baby my heart cries
(Ruby, Ruby, Ruby baby)
I'm gonna steal you away from all those guys
(Ruby, Ruby, Ruby baby) From the sunny day I met you
Made a bet that I would get you
Ruby, Ruby when will you be mine? I've got a girl and Ruby is her name
(Ruby, Ruby, Ruby baby)
I'd give the world just to set her heart aflame
(Ruby, Ruby, Ruby baby) Got some lovin' money too
Gonna give it all to you
Ruby, Ruby when will you be mine, oh mine?
Ruby, Ruby when will you be mine? Ruby, Ruby, Ruby baby
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby baby We're gonna break out the hats and hooters
When Josie comes home
We're gonna rev up the motor scooters
When Josie comes home to stay
We're gonna park in the street
Sleep on the beach and make it
Throw down the jam till the girls say when
Lay down the law and break it
When Josie comes home When Josie comes home
So good
She's the pride of the neighborhood
She's the raw flame
The live wire
She prays like a Roman
With her eyes on fire Jo would you love to scrapple
She'll never say no
Shine up the battle apple
We'll shake 'em all down tonight
We're gonna mix in the street
Strike at the stroke of midnight
Dance on the bones till the girls say when
Pick up what's left by daylight
When Josie comes home When Josie comes home
So bad
She's the best friend we ever had
She's the raw flame
The live wire
She prays like a Roman
With her eyes on fire When Josie comes home
So good
She's the pride of the neighborhood
She's the raw flame
The live wire
She prays like a Roman
With her eyes on fire Bodhisattva
Would you take me by the hand
Bodhisattva
Would you take me by the hand
Can you show me
The shine of your Japan
The sparkle of your china
Can you show me

Would you take me by the hand
Can you show me
The shine of your Japan
The sparkle of your china Can you show me
Bodhisattva Bodhisattva
I'm gonna sell my house in town
Bodhisattva

To shine in your Japan To sparkle in your China
Yes, I'll be there
Bodhisattva
Bodhisattva, Bodhisattva, Bodhisattva
Bodhisattva, Bodhisattva, Bodhisattva
Bodhisattva, look out Son you better be ready for love
On this glory day
This is your chance to believe
What I've got to say Keep your eyes on the sky
Put a dollar in the kitty
Don't the moon look pretty Tonight when I chase the dragon
The water may change to cherry wine
And the silver will turn to gold
Time out of mind
(Time out of mind) I am holding the mystical sphere
It's direct from Lhasa
Where people are rolling in the snow
Far from the world we know Children we have it right here
It's the light in my eyes
It's perfection and grace
It's the smile on my face Tonight when I chase the dragon
The water may change to cherry wine
And the silver will turn to gold
Time out of mind
(Time out of mind) Children we have it right here
It's the light in my eyes
It's perfection and grace
It's the smile on my face Tonight when I chase the dragon
The water may change to cherry wine
And the silver will turn to gold
Time out of mind Five names that I can
Hardly stand to hear
Including yours and mine
And one more chimp who isn't here I can see the ladies talking
How the times are getting hard
And that fearsome excavation
On Magnolia Boulevard Yes, I'm going insane
And I'm laughing at the frozen rain
And I'm so alone
Honey, when they gonna send me home Bad sneakers and
A Piña Colada, my friend
Stompin' on the avenue
By Radio City with a
Transistor and a large
Sum of money to spend You fella, you tearin' up the street
You wear that white tuxedo
How you gonna beat the heat Do you take me for a fool
Do you think that I don't see
That ditch out in the valley
That they're digging just for me Yes, I'm going insane
You know I'm laughing
At the frozen rain
And I feel like I'm so alone
Honey, when they gonna send me home Bad sneakers and
A Piña Colada, my friend
Stompin' on the avenue
By Radio City with a
Transistor and a large
Sum of money to spend You know I'm going insane
Yes, I'm laughing at the frozen rain
And I'm so alone
Honey, when they gonna send me home Bad sneakers and
A Piña Colada, my friend
Stompin' on the avenue
By Radio City with a
Transistor and a large
Sum of money to spend I know this super highway
This bright familiar sun
I guess that I'm the lucky one
Who wrote that tired sea song
Set on this peaceful shore
You think you've heard this one before Well the danger on the rocks is surely past
Still I remain tied to the mast
Could it be that I have found my home at last
Home at last She serves the smooth retsina
She keeps me safe and warm
It's just the calm before the storm
Call in my reservation
So long hey thanks my friend
I guess I'll try my luck again Well the danger on the rocks is surely past
Still I remain tied to the mast
Could it be that I have found my home at last
Home at last
Well the danger on the rocks is surely past
Still I remain tied to the mast
Could it be that I have found my home at last
Home at last When Black Friday comes
I'll stand down by the door
And catch the gray men when they
Dive from the fourteenth floor When Black Friday comes
I'll collect everything I'm owed
And before my friends find out
I'll be on the road When Black Friday falls
You know it's got to be
Don't let it fall on me When Black Friday comes
I'll fly down to Muswellbrook
Gonna strike all the big red words
From my little black book Gonna do just what I please
Gonna wear no socks and shoes
With nothing to do but feed
All the kangaroos When Black Friday comes
I'll be on that hill
You know I will When Black Friday comes
I'm gonna dig myself a hole
Gonna lay down in it
'Til I satisfy my soul Gonna let the world pass by me
The Archbishop's gonna sanctify me
And if he don't come across
I'm gonna let it roll When Black Friday comes
I'm gonna stake my claim
I'll guess I'll change my name Drive west on sunset to the sea
Turn that jungle music down
Just until we're out of town
This is no one night stand
It's a real occasion
Close your eyes and you'll be there
It's everything they say
The end of a perfect day
Distant lights from across the bay
(babylon sisters shake it)
(babylon sisters shake it)
So fine so young
(tell me I'm the only one) (here come those Santa Ana winds again) We'll jog with show folk on the sand
Drink kirschwasser from a shell
San Francisco show and tell
Well I should know by now
That it's just a spasm
Like a Sunday in T.J.
That it's cheap but it's not free
That I'm not what I used to be
And that love's not a game for three (babylon sisters shake it)
(babylon sisters shake it)
So fine so young
(tell me I'm the only one)
(here comes those Santa Ana winds again) My friends say no
Don't go for their cotton candy
Son you're playing with fire
The kid will live and learn
As he watches his bridges burn
From the point of no return (babylon sisters shake it)
(babylon sisters shake it)
So fine so young
(tell me I'm the only one)
(you gotta shake it, baby)
(you gotta shake it, baby)
(you gotta shake it)
(you gotta shake it, baby)
(you gotta shake it, baby)
(you gotta shake it)
(you gotta shake it, baby) Well I've kicked around a lot since high school
I've worked a lot of nowhere gigs
From keyboard man in a rock'n ska band
To haulin' boss crude in the big rigs
Now I've come back home to plan my next move
From the comfort of my Aunt Faye's couch
When I see my little cousin Janine walk in
All I could say was ow-ow-ouch Honey how you've grown
Like a rose
Well we used to play
When we were three
How about a kiss for your cousin Dupree
How about a kiss for your cousin Dupree She turned my life into a living hell
In those little tops and tight capris
I pretended to be readin' the National Probe
As I was watchin' her wax her skis
On Saturday night she walked in with her date
And backs him up against the wall
I tumbled off the couch and heard myself sing
In a voice I never knew I had before Honey how you've grown
Like a rose
Well we used to play
When we were three
How about a kiss for your cousin Dupree
How about a kiss for your cousin Dupree I'll teach you everything I know
If you teach me how to do that dance
Life is short and quid pro quo
And what's so strange about a down-home family romance? One night we're playin' gin by a cracklin' fire
And I decided to make my play
I said babe with my boyish charm and good looks
How can you stand it for one more day
She said maybe it's the skeevy look in your eyes
Or that your mind has turned to applesauce
The dreary architecture of your soul
I said - but what is it exactly turns you off? Honey how you've grown
Like a rose
Well we used to play
When we were three
How about a kiss for your cousin Dupree
How about a kiss for your cousin Dupree Agents of the law
Luckless pedestrian
I know you're out there
With rage in your eyes and your megaphones Saying all is forgiven
Mad dog surrender
How can I answer?
A man of my mind can do anything I'm a bookkeeper's son
I don't want to shoot no one
Well, I crossed my old man back in Oregon
Don't take me alive Got a case of dynamite
I could hold out here all night
Yes, I crossed my old man back in Oregon
Don't take me alive Can you hear the evil crowd
The lies and the laughter
I hear my inside
The mechanized hum of another world Where no sun is shining
No red light flashing
Here in this darkness
I know what I've done
I know all at once who I am I'm a bookkeeper's son
I don't want to shoot no one
Well, I crossed my old man back in Oregon
Don't take me alive Got a case of dynamite
I could hold out here all night
Yes, I crossed my old man back in Oregon
Don't take me alive I'm a bookkeeper's son
I don't want to shoot no one
Well, I crossed my old man back in Oregon
Don't take me alive Got a case of dynamite
I could hold out here all night
Yes, I crossed my old man back in Oregon
Don't take me alive
Don't take me alive Babs and Clean Willie were in love, they said
So in love the preacher's face turned red
Soon everybody knew the thing was dead
He shouts, she bites, they wrangle through the night, yeah
She go crazy
Got to make a getaway Papa say
Oh, no hesitation
No tears and no hearts breakin'
No remorse
Oh, congratulations
This is your Haitian divorce She takes the taxi to the good hotel
Bon marché, as far as she can tell
She drinks the zombie from the coco shell
She feels all right, she get it on tonight, yeah
Mister driver
Take me where the music play Papa say
Oh, no hesitation
No tears and no hearts breakin'
No remorse
Oh, congratulations
This is your Haitian divorce At the Grotto
In the greasy chair
Sits the Charlie with the lotion and the kinky hair
When she smiled, she said it all
The band was hot, so
They danced the famous merengue
Now we dolly back
Now we fade to black Tearful reunion in the U.S.A.
Day by day, those memories fade away
Some babies grow in a peculiar way
It changed, it grew, and everybody knew, yeah
Semi-mojo
Who's this kinky so-and-so? Papa go
Oh, no hesitation
No tears and no hearts breakin'
No remorse
Oh, congratulations
This is your Haitian divorce "It's a beggars life", Said the Queen of Spain
But don't tell it to a poor man
'Cause he's got to kill for every thrill
The best he can Everywhere around me
I see jealousy and mayhem
Because no men have all their peace of mind
To carry them Well I don't really care
If it's wrong or if it's right
But until my ship comes in
I'll live night by night When the joker tried to tell me
I could cut it in this rube town
When he tried to hang that sign on me
I said "Take it down" When the dawn patrol got to tell you twice
They're gonna do it with a shotgun
Yes, I'm cashing in this ten-cent life
For another one Well I ain't got the heart
To lose another fight
So until my ship comes in
I'll live night by night Well I don't really care
If it's wrong or if it's right
But until my ship comes in
I'll live night by night Night by night
Night by night
Night by night
Night by night [Instrumental] I never seen you looking so bad my funky one
You tell me that your superfine mind has come undone Any major dude with half a heart surely will tell you my friend
Any minor world that breaks apart falls together again When the demon is at your door
In the morning it won't be there no more
Any major dude will tell you
Any major dude will tell you Have you ever seen a squonk's tears? Well, look at mine
The people on the street have all seen better times Any major dude with half a heart surely will tell you my friend
Any minor world that breaks apart falls together again When the demon is at your door
In the morning it won't be there no more
Any major dude will tell you
Any major dude will tell you I can tell you all I know, the where to go, the what to do
You can try to run but you can't hide from what's inside of you Any major dude with half a heart surely will tell you my friend
Any minor world that breaks apart falls together again When the demon is at your door
In the morning it won't be there no more
Any major dude will tell you
Any major dude will tell you
Any major dude will tell you Just when I say, "Boy, we can't miss
You are golden," then you do this
You say this guy is so cool
Snapping his fingers like a fool
One more expensive kiss-off
Who do you think I am? Lord, I know you're a special friend
But you don't seem to understand
We got heavy rollers, I think you should know
Try again tomorrow Can't you see they're laughing at me?
Get rid of him
I don't care what you do at home
Would you care to explain? Who is the gaucho, amigo?
Why is he standing in your spangled leather poncho
And your elevator shoes?
Bodacious cowboys
Such as your friend will never be welcome here
High in the Custerdome What'd I tell you back down the line?
I'll scratch your back, you can scratch mine
No, he can't sleep on the floor
What do you think I'm yelling for?
I'll drop him near the freeway
Doesn't he have a home? Lord, I know you're a special friend
But you refuse to understand
You're a nasty schoolboy with no place to go
Try again tomorrow Don't tell me he'll wait in the car
Look at you
Holding hands with the man from Rio
Would you care to explain? Who is the gaucho, amigo?
Why is he standing in your spangled leather poncho
With the studs that match your eyes?
Bodacious cowboys
Such as your friend will never be welcome here
High in the Custerdome Bad news breaking in 18A
Missy's kitty turn inside out she say
Spider queen demon and that whole crew
Across the lobby the wicker wing chair flew
All the nice people those goodly souls
Quaking in their respective hidey-holes
Everyone's wasted in this gruesome dream
Not a one of them left to hear you scream CHORUS:
Two against nature don't you know
Who's gonna grok the shape of things to go
Two against nature make them groan
Who's gonna break the shape of things unknown Madame Erzulie she come last night
Bang you silly but leave a nasty bite
There on your nightstand much worse than that
Panatela and old black derby hat Call your doctor - call your shrink
Western science she strictly rinkydink
They all masissi but we hang tough
Apsatively gonna help you beat that stuff CHORUS:
Two against nature tan and lean
Puttin' big heat on skanky things unseen
Two against nature slinging dread
These boys wanna bang the skulls of things undead T-Bone Angie she champion liar
Sew the mouth shut with rusty chicken wire
Brother Lou Garue and the Jerry Garry
Sprinkling chicken water gonna hush all three
Beautiful housewife in deep distress
'Specially you deserve our very best
Two against nature they got that stuff
Good things happening when you see about us CHORUS:
Two against nature love this gig
Pull up the weeds before they're too damn big
Two against nature stand alone
Who's gonna chase the shape of things unknown
Two against nature don't you know
Who's gonna drop the boom on things to go
Two against nature make them groan
Gonna go bang-zoom to the moon on things unknown Scrape the wallboards the whole damn batch
Catch the maggoty eggs before they hatch
Pepper and ratbone make damn sure
Shake the rubbish out on the patio floor
Soak the timber with special spray
Nuke the itty bitty ones right where they lay
Whip the bastards while they still green
Take the firemop - sweep it kissing clean A shadow crossed the blue miami sky
As we hit the causeway by the big hotel
We fought
Now I can't remember why
After all the words were said and tears were gone
We vowed we'd never say goodbye When we kissed we could hear the sound of thunder
As we watched the regulars rush the big hotels
We kissed again as the showers swept the florida shore
You opened your umbrella
But we walked between the raindrops back to your door In my dreams I can hear the sound of thunder
I can see the causeway by the big hotels
That happy day we'll find each other on that florida shore
You'll open your umbrella
And we'll walk between the raindrops back to your door... No I'm never gonna do it without the fez on
Oh no
No I'm never gonna do it without the fez on
Oh no
That's what I am
Please understand
I wanna be your holy man No I'm never gonna do it without the fez on
Oh no
Ain't never gonna do it without the fez on
Oh no
That's what I am
Please understand
I wanna be your holy man No I'm never gonna do it without the fez on
Oh no
Don't make me do it without the fez on
Oh no
That's what I am
Please understand
I wanna be your holy man Daddy, don't live in that New York City no more
He don't celebrate Sunday on a Saturday night no more
Daddy don't need no lock and key
For the piece he stowed out on Avenue D
Daddy don't live in that New York City no more Daddy don't drive in that Eldorado no more
He don't travel on down to the neighborhood liquor store
Lucy still loves her coke and rum
But she sits alone 'cause her daddy can't come
Daddy don't drive in that Eldorado no more, no more Driving like a fool out to Hackensack
Drinking his dinner from a paper sack
He says, "I gotta see a joker
And I'll be right back" No, my daddy don't live in that New York City no more, no more
He can't get tight every night pass out on the barroom floor
No, daddy can't get no fine cigar
But we know you're smoking wherever you are
Daddy don't live in that New York City no more, no more
No, no, no, no no At nervous time
We roll downtown
We've got scenes to crash
We're gonna trick and trash
We're gonna find some fun
We hit the street
With visors down
With our thermasuits
Sealed up tight
We can beat the freeze
And get saved tonight
Let's stop off at the metroplex
That little dancer's got some style
Yes she's the one I'll be waiting for
At the stage door Chorus:
Snowbound
Let's sleep in today
Wake me up
When the wolves come out to play
Heat up
These white nights
We're gonna turn this town
Into a city of lights We take the tube
To club hi ho
It's about deadspace
It's a marketplace
And a party house too
Something new
From charlie tokyo
It's a kind of pyramid
With a human heart
Beating in an ion grid
A critic grabs us
And says without a smile
The work seduces us with light
Eviva laughs and we step out
Into the blue-white night Chorus We sail our icecats on the frozen river
Some loser fires off a flare, amen
For seven seconds it's like christmas day
And then it's dark again
And then it's dark again Chorus Drive along the sea
Far from the city's twitch and smoke
To a misty beach
That's where my life became a joke On the dunes
On the dunes
(became a joke on the dunes)
Where rents are high
And seabirds cry
On the dunes As you spoke you must have known
It was a kind of homicide
I stood and watched my happiness
Drift outwards with the tide On the dunes
On the dunes
(homicide on the dunes)
It wasn't fair
It's brutal there
On the dunes Pretty boats
Sweeping along the shore
In the faltering light
Pretty women
With their lovers by their side
It's like an awful dream
I have most every night In the summer all the swells
Join in the search for sun and sand
For me it's just a joyless place
Where this loneliness began On the dunes
On the dunes
(loneliness on the dunes)
I'm pretty tough
But the wind is rough
On the dunes 6: 05, outside the stadium
Special delivery for Hoops McCann
Brut and charisma poured from the shadow where he stood
Looking good, he's a crowd-pleasing man One on one, he's schoolyard Superman
Crashing the backboard, he's Jungle Jim again
When it's all over
We'll make some calls from my car
We're a star (It's a glamour profession
The L.A. concession)
Local boys will spend a quarter
Just to shine the silver bowl
Living hard will take its toll
Illegal fun
Under the sun, boys All aboard the Carib Cannibal
Off to Barbados just for the ride
Jack, with his radar, stalking the dread moray eel
At the wheel with his Eurasian bride On the town, we dress for action
Celluloid bikers is Friday's theme
I drove the Chrysler
Watched from the darkness while they danced
I'm the one (It's a glamour profession) I'm the one
(The L.A. concession)
Local boys will spend a quarter
Just to shine the silver bowl
Living hard will take its toll
Illegal fun
Under the sun, boys (Hollywood, I know your middle name
Who inspires your fabled fools?)
That's my claim to fame Jive Miguel, he's in from Bogota
Meet me at midnight at Mr. Chow's
Szechuan dumplings
Now that the deal has been done
I'm the one (It's a glamour profession) I'm the one
(The L.A. concession)
Local boys will spend a quarter
Just to shine the silver bowl
Living hard will take its toll
Illegal fun
Under the sun, boys
Illegal fun
Under the sun, boys I'm lester the nightfly
Hello baton rouge
Won't you turn your radio down
Respect the seven second delay we use So you say there's a race
Of men in the trees
You're for tough legislation
Thanks for calling
I wait all night for calls like these An independent station
Wjaz
With jazz and conversation
From the foot of mt. belzoni
Sweet music
Tonight the night is mine
Late line 'til the sun comes through the skylight I've got plenty of java
And chesterfield kings
But I feel like crying
I wish I had a heart like ice
Heart like ice If you want your honey
To look super swell
You must spring for that little blue jar
Patton's kiss and tell
Kiss and tell An independent station
Wjaz
With jazz and conversation
From the foot of mt. belzoni
Sweet music
Tonight the night is mine
Late line 'til the sun comes through the skylight You'd never believe it
But once there was a time
When love was in my life
I sometimes wonder
What happened to that flame
The answer's still the same
It was you, it was you
Tonight you're still on my mind An independent station
Wjaz
With jazz and conversation
From the foot of mt. belzoni
Sweet music
Tonight the night is mine
Late line 'til the sun comes through the skylight Katy tried, I was halfway crucified
I was on the other side of no tomorrow
You walked in and my life began again
Just when I'd spent the last piaster I could borrow All night long, we would sing that stupid song
And every word we sang, I knew was true Are you with me Dr. Wu
Are you really just a shadow
Of the man that I once knew
Are you crazy are you high
Or just an ordinary guy
Have you done all you can do
Are you with me doctor? Don't seem right, I've been strung out here all night
I've been waiting for the taste, you said you'd bring to me
Biscayne Bay where the Cuban gentlemen sleep all day
I went searching for the song, you used to sing to me Katy lies, You could see it in her eyes
But imagine my surprise when I saw you Are you with me Dr. Wu
Are you really just a shadow
Of the man that I once knew
She is lovely yes she's sly
And you're an ordinary guy
Has she finally got to you
Can you hear me doctor? Are you with me doctor?
Can you hear me doctor?
Are you with me doctor?
Can you hear me doctor? Are you with me doctor?
Can you hear me doctor?
Are you with me doctor? It's high time for a walk on the real side
Let's admit the bastards beat us
I move to dissolve the corporation
In a pool of margaritas
So let's switch off all the lights
Light up all the Luckies
Crankin' up the afterglow
'Cause we're goin' out of business
Everything must go Talk about your major pain and suffering
Now our self-esteem is shattered
Show the world a mighty hidey-ho face
As we go sliding down the ladder
It was sweet up at the top
'Til that ill wind started blowing
Now it's cozy down below
'Cause we're goin' out of business
Everything must go We gave it our best shot
But keep in mind we got a lot
The sky, the moon, good food and the weather
First-run movies—does anybody get lucky twice?
Wouldn't it be nice... Tell me can you dig it Miss Fugazy
Now it's gone from late to later
Frankly I could use a little face time
In the service elevator
And if Dave from Acquisitions
Wants to get in on the action
With his Handicam in tow
Well we're goin' out of business
Everything must go Can it be the sorry sun is rising
Guess it's time for us to book it
Talk about the famous road not taken
In the end we never took it
And if somewhere on the way
We got a few good licks in
No one's ever gonna know
'Cause we're goin' out of business
Everything must go Hello one and all
Was it you I used to know
Can't you hear me call
On this old ham radio All I got to say
I'm alive and feeling fine
Should you come my way
You can share my poison wine No marigolds in the promised land
There's a hole in the ground
Where they used to grow
Any man left on the Rio Grande
Is the king of the world
As far as I know I won't take your bread
I don't need no helping hand
I can't be no savage
I can't be no highwayman Show me where you are
You and I will spend this day
Driving in my car
Through the ruins of Santa Fe No marigolds in the promised land
There's a hole in the ground
Where they used to grow
Any man left on the Rio Grande
Is the king of the world
As far as I know I'm reading last year's papers
Although I don't know why
Assassins, cons and rapers
Might as well die When you come around
No more pain and no regrets
Watch the sun go brown
Smoking cobalt cigarettes There's no need to hide
Taking things the easy way
If I stay inside
I might live 'till Saturday No marigolds in the promised land
There's a hole in the ground
Where they used to grow
Any man left on the Rio Grande
Is the king of the world
King of the world
As far as I know Some turnout, a hundred grand
Get with it we'll shake his hand
Don't bother to understand
Don't question the little man
Be part of the brotherhood
Yes it's chain lightning
It feels so good Hush brother, we cross the square
Act natural like you don't care
Turn slowly and comb your hair
Don't trouble the midnight air
We're standing just where he stood
It was chain lightning
It feels so good Got a feeling I've been here before
Watching as you cross the killing floor
You know you'll have to pay it all
You'll pay today or pay tomorrow
You fasten up your beaded gown
Then you try to tie me down
Do you work it out one by one
Or played in combination
You throw out your gold teeth
Do you see how they roll I have seen your iron and your brass
Can't you see it shine behind the glass
Your fortune is your roving eye
Your mouth and legs
Your gift for the runaround
Torture is the main attraction
I don't need that kind of action
You don't have to dance for me
I've seen your dance before
Do you throw out your gold teeth
Do you see how they roll Tobacco they grow in Peking
In the Year of the Locust
You'll see a sad thing
Even Cathy Berberian knows
There's one roulade she can't sing
Dumb luck my friend
Won't suck me in this time Got a feeling I've been here before
Won't you let me help you find the door
All you got to do is use
Your silver shoes
A gift for the runaround
Use your knack darlin'
Take one step back darlin'
There ain't nothing in Chicago
For a monkey woman to do
Do you throw out your gold teeth
Do you see how they roll Our town is just like any other
Good citizens at work and play
Normal folks doin' buisiness in the normal way
This morning was like any other day
Mommies kissing daddies goodbye
Then the milkman screamed
And pointed up at the sky Chorus:
From Sheilus to the reefs of Kizmar
From Stargate and the Outer Worlds
They're speeding towards our sun
They're on a party run
Here come Tomorrow's Girls Tomorrow's Girls
You see them on the grass at lunch hour
Soaking up the vertical rays In their summer dresses
A little smile can really make your day
Their kisses feel like real kisses
And when they cry they cry real tears
But what's left in your arms
When the static clears Chorus:
They're landing on the Jersey beaches
Their engines make the white sand swirl
The heat is so intense
Earthmen have no defence
Against Tomorrow's Girls In the cool of the evening
In the last light of the triple sun
I wait by the go-tree
When the day's busy work is done
Soon the warm night breezes
Start rolling in off the sea Yes
at lantern time
That's when you come to me
Come to me Our home is just like any other
We're grillin' burgers on the back lawn
Some times goes by
We fall asleep with the tv on
I dream about a laughing angel
Then the laugh becomes a furious whine
Look out fellas
It's shredding time Chorus:
They're mixing with the population
A virus wearing pumps and pearls
Lord help the lonely guys
Hooked by those hungry eyes
Here come Tomorrow's Girls
Tommorow's Girls Felonious, my old friend
Step on in and let me shake your hand
So glad that you're here again for one more time
Let your madness run with mine
Streets still unseen, we'll find somehow
No time is better than now Tell me where are you driving midnight cruiser?
Where is your bounty of fortune and fame?
I am another gentlemen loser
Drive me to Harlem or somewhere the same The world that we used to know
People tell me it don't turn no more
The places we used to go
Familiar faces that ain't smilin' like before
The time of our time has come and gone
I fear we've been waiting too long Tell me where are you driving midnight cruiser?
Where is your bounty of fortune and fame?
I am another gentlemen loser
Drive me to Harlem or somewhere the same Tell me where are you driving midnight cruiser?
Where is your bounty of fortune and fame?
I am another gentlemen loser
Drive me to Harlem or somewhere the same Tell me where are you driving midnight cruiser?
Where is your bounty of fortune and fame?
I am another gentlemen loser
Drive me to Harlem or somewhere the same Tell me where are you driving midnight cruiser?
Where is your bounty of fortune and fame? You
In your Lark
You're a mark
You're a screamer
You know
How to hustle
Daddy
Is a rare
Millionaire
I don't care
Yeah you
Got the muscle
I got the news Yes dear
How did you know
Can't you see our love will grow Take it
In your hand
All the sirens
And the band
Get to bendin' my ear
How
Was I to know
About the warm
Soulful secret
You been keepin' for years
I got the news Slow down I'll tell you when
I may never walk again Broadway Duchess
Darling if you only knew
Half as much as
Everybody thinks you do
What I hear
May be true
I would still be proud
To know you Spanish kissin'
See it glisten
You came ragin'
Love rampagin'
I got the news Yes dear
How did you know
Can't you see our love will grow I was born yesterday
When they brought my kamakiri
When they handed me the keys
It's a steam-power 10
The frame is out of glasgow
The tech is balinese
It's not a freeway bullet
Or a bug with monster wheels
It's a total biosphere
The farm in the back
Is hydroponic
Good, fresh things
Every day of the year
Good, fresh things
Every day of the year With all screens and functions
In sync lock with tripstar
This cool rolling bubble
Is all set to samba
This route could be trouble
(this route could be trouble) Chorus:
Steamin' up
That trans-island skyway
Tryin' to make that final deadline
And if the lanes are clear
We're gonna drive a little harder
We'll be deep in the zone by cryin' time Say, there's a wreck
On the side of the road
Lots of blood and broken glass
The kid who was driving
I know from somewhere
Some kids just drive too fast
Wait just a minute
There's a beautiful survivor
With dancer's legs and laughing eyes
C'mon snakehips, it's all over now
Strap in tight cause it's a long sweet ride Relax - put some sounds on
I'll brew up some decaf
C'mon kick off those heels ma'am
Now breathe in and sigh out
Let's get with the program
(let's talk about the good times) Chorus We reach the sprangle
Just at dawn
These little streets I used to know
Is that my father
Mowin' the lawn
(c'mon daddy get in let's go)
C'mon daddy get in let's go
C'mon daddy get in let's go
C'mon daddy get in let's go
C'mon daddy get in let's go
C'mon daddy get in let's go
C'mon daddy get in let's go We pull into five zoos
Past motels and drive-thrus
That noon sun is blinding
The tidepools are boiling
Below plates are grinding
(let's talk about the good times) Chorus I'm Lester the Nightfly
Hello Baton Rouge
Won't you turn your radio down
Respect the seven second delay we use So you say there's a race
Of men in the trees
You're for tough legislation
Thanks for calling
I wait all night for calls like these An independent station
WJAZ
With jazz and conversation
From the foot of Mt. Belzoni
Sweet music
Tonight the night is mine
Late line 'til the sun comes through the skylight I've got plenty of java
And Chesterfield Kings
But I feel like crying
I wish I had a heart like ice
Heart like ice If you want your honey
To look super swell
You must spring for that little blue jar
Patton's Kiss And Tell
Kiss And Tell An independent station
WJAZ
With jazz and conversation
From the foot of Mt. Belzoni
Sweet music
Tonight the night is mine
Late line 'til the sun comes through the skylight You'd never believe it
But once there was a time
When love was in my life
I sometimes wonder
What happened to that flame
The answer's still the same
It was you, it was you
Tonight you're still on my mind An independent station
WJAZ
With jazz and conversation
From the foot of Mt. Belzoni
Sweet music
Tonight the night is mine
Late line 'til the sun comes through the skylight A race of angels bound with one another
A dish of dollars laid out for all to see
A tower room at Eden Rock
His golf at noon for free Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me His lady's aching to bring a body down
She daily preaches on where she wants to be
An evening with a movie queen
A face we all have seen Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me A case of aces done up loose for dealing
A piece of island cooling in the sea
The whole of time we gain or lose
And power enough to choose Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me Yeah, Brooklyn owes the charmer under me
Brooklyn owes the charmer under me I decline
To walk the line
They tell me that I'm lazy
Worldly wise
I realize
That everybody's crazy
A woman's voice reminds me
To serve and not to speak
Am I myself or just another freak Don't you know
There's fire in the hole
And nothing left to burn
I'd like to run out now
There's nowhere left to turn With a cough
I shake it off
And work around my yellow stripe
Should I hide
And eat my pride
Or wait until it's good and ripe
My life is boiling over
It's happened once before
I wish someone would open up the door Don't you know
There's fire in the hole
And nothing left to burn
I'd like to run out now
There's nowhere left to turn Johnny's playroom
Is a bunker filled with sand
He's become a third world man Smoky Sunday
He's been mobilized since dawn
Now he's crouching on the lawn
He's a third world man Soon you'll throw down your disguise
We'll see behind those bright eyes
By and by
When the sidewalks are safe
For the little guy I saw the fireworks
I believed that I was dreaming
Till the neighbors came out screaming
He's a third world man Soon you'll throw down your disguise
We'll see behind those bright eyes
By and by
When the sidewalks are safe
For the little guy When he's crying out
I just sing that Ghana rondo
E l'era del terzo mondo
He's a third world man He's a third world man He's a third world man Brother in tears
Look at this chain of sorrows
Stretching all the way from here and now to hell and gone
I was Kid Clean
She was Anne de Siècle
Just a thrill away from punching through to the cosmic wow It started out good
Then it got lots better
Makin' up the rules as we went along
But with a business like this
There's a gnarly downside I'm way deep into nothing special
Riding the crest of a wave breaking just west of Hollywood Swingin' so hard
We burned right through the summer
Till the axis of pain/pleasure sheared the arc of desire
From the Rebus affair
To the streets of Culver City
Places and events slip below the horizon line Now at this time
Into our pretty story
The truth compels us to bring a certain name
Meet if you will
Dr. Warren Kruger I'm way deep into nothing special
Riding the crest of a wave breaking just west of Hollywood She reached out for my hand
While I watched myself lurch across the room
And I almost got there
I almost got there
I almost got there
Almost got there Look in my eyes
Don't you see the core is frozen?
You can't ask me to access the dreams I don't have now
Sadly for us
Our little talk is over
So together we'll endure the tyranny of the disallowed Don't you love Port Blanc
When Hooterie is over?
When the girls get easy and the crowds are gone
A weekend of bliss
Then the rainy season I'm way deep into nothing special
Riding the crest of a wave breaking just west of Hollywood I'm way deep into nothing special It must have been my lucky Thursday
Your dad went on that spree
Before the crew could put out the fires
You hopped a bus for NYC
Down in Tampa the future looked desperate and dark
Now you're the wonderwaif of Gramercy Park Who makes the morning fabulous
Who says today's a fun day
Why do I feel like sailing again
Honey it's you - Janie Runaway Let's grab some takeout from Dean and Deluca
A hearty gulping wine
You be the showgirl, I'll be Sinatra
Way back in '59
Sweetness in heels, look at you in long black gloves
Come to Old Blue Eyes tell me, who do you love Who makes the traffic interesting
Rescues a dreary Sunday
Who makes me feel like painting again
Honey it's you - Janie Runaway Let's plan a weekend alone together
Out to Binky's place
The sugar shack in Pennsylvania
Or would that be a federal case?
We'll take the Big Red, the Blazer, it's nice inside
And guess who's coming along for the ride Who has a friend named Melanie
Who's not afraid to try new things
Who gets to spend her birthday in Spain
Possibly you - Janie Runaway Who makes the morning fabulous
Rescues a dreary Sunday
Who gets to spend her birthday in Spain
Possibly you - Janie Runaway And they wandered in
From the city of St. John
Without a dime Wearing coats that shined
Both red and green colors
From their sunny island From their boats of iron
They looked upon the promised land
Where surely life was sweet On the rising tide
To New York City did they ride
Into the street See the glory
(See the glory of)
Of the royal scam They are hounded down
To the bottom of a bad town
Amid the ruins Where they learn to fear
An angry race of fallen kings
Their dark companions While the memory of
Their southern sky was clouded by
A savage winter Every patron saint
Hung on the wall, shared the room
With twenty sinners See the glory
(See the glory of)
Of the royal scam By the blackened wall
He does it all
He thinks he's died and gone to heaven Now the tale is told
By the old man back home
He reads the letter How they are paid in gold
Just to babble in the back room
All night and waste their time And they wandered in
From the city of St. John
Without a dime See the glory
(See the glory of)
Of the royal scam See the glory
(See the glory of)
Of the royal scam See the glory
(See the glory of)
Of the royal scam With stocking face I bought a gun
The plan was set, the plan was done
Looked at my watch and started for the door
Now the food here ain't so good no more
And they closed the package store Love your mama, love your brother
Love 'em till they run for cover
Turn the light off, keep your shirt on
Cry a jag on me Oh, Michael, oh, Jesus, you know I'm not to blame
You know my reputation for playin' a good clean game
Oh, Michael, oh, Jesus, I'll keep my promise when
You turn that heartbeat over again My poison's named you know my brand
So please make mine a double, Sam
Stir it up nice, I'll eat it right here
This highway runs from Paraguay
And I've just come all the way Love your mama, love your brother
Love 'em till they run for cover
Turn the light off, keep your shirt on
Cry a jag on me Oh, Michael, oh, Jesus, you know I'm not to blame
You know my reputation for playin' a good clean game
Oh, Michael, oh, Jesus, I'll keep my promise when
You turn that heartbeat over again We warned the corpse of William Wright
Not to cuss and drink all night
Ticket in hand we saw him laid to rest
Oh, but zombie see and zombie do
He's here with me and you Love your mama, love your brother
Love 'em till they run for cover
Turn the light off, keep your shirt on
Cry a jag on me Oh, Michael, oh, Jesus, you know I'm not to blame
You know my reputation for playin' a good clean game
Oh, Michael, oh, Jesus, I'll keep my promise when
You turn that heartbeat over again
Turn that heartbeat over again Savoy sides presents a new saxophone sensation
It's Parker's band with a smooth style of syncopation
Kansas City born and growing
You won't believe what the boys are blowing You got to come on man
And take a piece of Mister Parker's band You'll be riding by, bareback on your armadillo
You'll be grooving high or relaxin' at Camarillo
Suddenly the music hits you
It's a bird in flight that just can't quit you You got to come on man
And take a piece of Mister Parker's band We will spend a dizzy weekend smacked into a trance
Me and you will listen to
A little bit of what made the preacher dance Bring your horn along and you can add to the pure confection
And if you can't fly you'll have to move in with the rhythm section
Either way you're bound to function
Fifty-Second Street's the junction You got to come on man
And take a piece of Mister Parker's
Clap your hands and take a piece of Mister Parker's
Come on man and take a piece of Mister Parker's band A race of angels
Bound with one another
A dish of dollars
Laid out for all to see
A tower room at Eden Rock
His golf at noon for free
Brooklyn owes the charmer
Under me His lady's aching
To bring a body down
She daily preaches
On where she wants to be
An evening with a movie queen
A face we all have seen
Brooklyn owes the charmer
Under me A case of aces
Done up loose for dealing
A piece of island cooling in the sea
The whole of time we gain or lose
And power enough to choose
Brooklyn owes the charmer
Under me I hear you are singing a song of the past
I see no tears
I know that you know it may be the last
For many years
You'd gamble or give anything
To be in with the better half
But how many friends must I have
To begin with to make you laugh? Will you still have a song to sing
When the razor boy comes
And take your fancy things away?
Will you still be singing it
On that cold and windy day? You know that the coming is so close at hand
You feel all right
I guess only women in cages can stand
This kind of night
I guess only women in cages
Can play down the things they lose
You think no tomorrow will come
When you lay down, you can't refuse Will you still have a song to sing
When the razor boy comes
And take your fancy things away?
Will you still be singing it
On that cold and windy day? I guess only women in cages
Can play down the things they lose
You think no tomorrow will come
When you lay down, you can't refuse Will you still have a song to sing
When the razor boy comes
And take your fancy things away?
Will you still be singing it
On that cold and windy day? Start on key plantain
Walk a tropical mile
You'll see a house
In the spanish style
There's a room in back
With a view of the sea
Where she sits and dreams
Does she dream of me When summer's gone
I get ready
To make that carribee run
I've got to have
Some time in the sun Chorus:
When the cold wind comes
I go where the dahlias bloom
I keep drifting back
To your florida room She's dressed too warm
For this latitude
We go out to lunch
With some jamaican dude
Then the sunshower breaks
We come in out of the rain
But in her florida room
There's a hurricane While the city freezes over
We'll be strollin' down the shore
Can she bring me back
To life once more Chorus When summer's gone
I get ready
To make that carribee run
I've got to have
Some time in the sun Chorus My coat is black and the moon is yellow
Here is where I get off
As you can see for yourself old girl in the Green Book
I tango down to the smoky lobby
My eyes adjust to the light
The new cashier looks like Jill St. John
Can that be right?
I'm rolling into the bar at Joey's
They're getting ready to close
Here she comes very "Kiss Me Deadly'?
My life, my love, my third hand rose Flash ahead to a yummy playback
Just you and me in a room
Double dreaming a page at a time in the Green Book The torso rocks and the eyes are keepers
Now where'd we sample those legs?
I'm thinking Marilyn 4.0 in the Green Book
I like the neon I love the music
Anachronistic but nice
The seamless segue from fun to fever
It's a sweet device I'm so in love with this dirty city
This crazy grid of desire
The festive icons along the way
The boardwalk, the lovers, the house on fire
She's kind of cute but a little younger
She's got the mood and the moves
It's kinda scary to dig yourself in the Green Book Where did the bastard run
Is he still around
Now you gotta tell me everything you did baby
I'm gonna get a gun
Shoot the lover down
Are you gonna tell me everything you did baby
Traces are everywhere
In our happy home
Now you better tell me everything you did baby
I jumped out of my easy chair
It was not my own
Now I want to hear about everything you did baby I never knew you
You were a roller skater
You gonna show me later
(Turn up the Eagles the neighbors are listening) You know how people talk
I wonder what they say
I think you better tell me everything you did baby I never knew you
You were a roller skater
You gonna show me later You never came to me
When you were so inclined
Yes you could have told me everything you did baby
I know where baby's at
I know your filthy mind
Now you're gonna do me everything you did baby Alone in my cave
It's corn flakes and camels
And the long restless shadows of my life
None but the brave
Jim beam and jack daniels
Channelhopping these empty days and nights
Glued to the screen
Rerun by rerun
At the dark outer limits of my soul
Stranded between
The green acres of my good intentions
And the twilight zone of zero self-control So come on angel
Tune in on me
You 'll see your faithful servant
Lost in misery
And all of your hard work
Coming down to no good
Better see about me babe
If you only could now Girlfriend if it can't be you
I don't even have anyone to tell my story to
I said girlfriend if it can't be you
Girlfriend if it can't be you
I don't even have anyone to tell my story to
I said girlfriend if it can't be you Dust and despair
Cobwebs and confusion
Collecting in the corners of my room
All of my dreams
Bitter illusions
I just can't be rid of them too soon
Tired of my brain
Tired of this movie
Too tired to get up and shut it off
The time that remains
What good can it do me
Now that I know that too much is not enough
Wait a minute baby
What about my heart
Was it your idea
To take it all apart
And put it all back together
Just one piece at a time
Now it's down to you darling
That's why I'm all Girlfriend if it can't be you
I don't even have anyone to tell my story to
I said girlfriend if it can't be you
Girlfriend if it can't be you
I don't even have anyone to tell my story to
I said girlfriend if it can't be you I'm pullin' in a picture now
Up off my back pages
And all at once am privy to
The entire grim design
Of a great civilization
In the terminal stages
Of a slow but steady mental moral spiritual decline
And so it goes
And thus it is written
And all I want to know is
Where does a guy like me fit in? So I'm visualizing a cute little bunny
With a fluffy white tail and long grey floppy ears
Who looks up at me and says, doc don't you worry
All you got to do is, hide in here
Now all you got to do is to just say when
You might consider bringing your sweetness 'round here again Girlfriend if it can't be you
I don't even have anyone to tell my story to
I said girlfriend if it can't be you
Girlfriend if it can't be you
I don't even have anyone to tell my story to
I said girlfriend if it can't be you Kids if you want some fun
Mr. Lapage is your man
He's always laughing, having fun
Showing his films in the den Come on, come on
Soon you will be eighteen
I think you know what I mean
Don't tell your mama
Your daddy or mama
They'll never know where you been Everyone's gone to the movies
Now we're alone at last
Everyone's gone to the movies
Now we're alone at last Listen to what I say
He wants to show you the way
Right down the hallway with open arms
To teach you a new game to play Come on, come on
Soon it will be too late
Bobbing for apples can wait
We know you're used to
Sixteen or more
Sorry, we only have eight Everyone's gone to the movies
Now we're alone at last
Everyone's gone to the movies
Now we're alone at last Everyone's gone to the movies
Now we're alone at last
Everyone's gone to the movies
Now we're alone at last Kids if you want some fun
See what you never have seen
Take off your cheaters and set right down
Start the projection machine Everyone's gone to the movies
Now we're alone at last
Everyone's gone to the movies
Now we're alone at last Everyone's gone to the movies
Now we're alone at last
Everyone's gone to the movies
Now we're alone at last Everyone's gone to the movies
Now we're alone at last
Everyone's gone to the movies
Now we're alone at last I recall when I was small
How I spent my days alone
The busy world was not for me
So I went and found my own I would climb the garden wall
With a candle in my hand
I'd hide inside a hall of rock and sand On the stone an ancient hand
In a faded yellow-green
Made alive a worldly wonder
Often told but never seen Now and ever bound to labor
On the sea and in the sky
Every man and beast appeared
A friend as real as I Before the fall when they wrote it on the wall
When there wasn't even any Hollywood
They heard the call and they wrote it on the wall
For you and me we understood Can it be this sad design
Could be the very same
A woolly man without a face
And a beast without a name Nothin' here but history
Can you see what has been gone
Memory rush over me
Now I step into the sun Before the fall when they wrote it on the wall
When there wasn't even any Hollywood
They heard the call and they wrote it on the wall
For you and me we understood Before the fall when they wrote it on the wall
When there wasn't even any Hollywood
They heard the call and they wrote it on the wall
For you and me we understood Uptown
It's murder out in the street
Uptown
It's murder out in the street
That's where I found my mandarin plum
That's where you'd be if you found one Where the nights are bright
And joy is complete
Keep my squeeze on green flower street Since may
There's trouble most every night
Where once we danced our sweet routine
It reeks of wine and kerosene Where the nights are bright
And joy is complete
Keep my squeeze on green flower street There's a special place for lovers
One we understand
There where neon bends in daylight sky
In that sunny room she soothes me
Cools me with her fan
We're drifting
A thousand years roll by Lou chang
Her brother he's burning with rage
Lou chang
Her brother he's burning with rage
I'd like to know what's on his mind
He says hey buddy you're not my kind Where the nights are bright
And joy is complete
Keep my squeeze on green flower street Rose darling come to me
Snake Mary's gone to bed
All our steaming sounds of love
Cannot disturb her in her night
Or raise her sleeping head
All I ask of you
Is make my wildest dreams come true
No one sees and no one knows Rose darling come to me
Snake Mary dreams along
I would guess she's in Detroit
With lots of money in the bank
Although I could be wrong
You must know it's right
The spore is on the wind tonight
You won't feel it till it grows Rose darling my friend
With only you and what I've found
We'll wear the weary hours down Rose darling come to me
The clock is close at hand
All my empty words of love
Can never screen the flash I feel
Or make you understand
Honey can't you see
I know it's real it's got to be
Why not chase it where it goes Rose darling my friend
With only you and what I've found
We'll wear the weary hours down Now they lay his body down
Sad old men who run this town
I still recall the way
He led the charge and saved the day
Blue blood and rain
I can hear the bugle playin' We've seen the last
Of Good King Richard
Ring out the past
His name lives on and on Roll out the bones
And raise up your pitcher
Raise up your glass
To Good King John While he plundered far and wide
All his starving children cried
And though we sung his fame
We all went hungry just the same
He meant to shine
To the end of the line We've seen the last
Of Good King Richard
Ring out the past
His name lives on and on Roll out the bones
And raise up your pitcher
Raise up your glass
To Good King John And though we sung his fame
We all went hungry just the same
He meant to shine
To the end of the line We've seen the last
Of Good King Richard
Ring out the past
His name lives on and on Roll out the bones
And raise up your pitcher
Raise up your glass
To Good King John Raise up your glass
To Good King John
Raise up your glass
To Good King John Here at laughing pines
Where the party never ends
There's a spicy new attraction
On the funway
You can scan yourself
For traces of old heartaches
The details of desire
Shimmering - shimmering Yowie! - it's connie lee
At the wheel of her shark-de-ville
We're cruisin' at about a thousand miles an hour
But the car is standin' still
So good to hear that crazy laugh
To hear her whisper hold me tight
To learn to love all over again
On that warm wet april night Chorus:
Swing out
To lake nostalgia
Route 5 to laughing pines
Get off at funway west
Drive into springtime
Drive into springtime Easter break - '66
A shack on cape sincere
Mad mona bakin' gospel candy
It was a radical year
We get a little silly
And fall into microspace
It's even better this time around
With coltrane on the k.l.h. Chorus It's you and me honey, in a crowded booth
At the smokehouse in the sand
I'm dragging out some bad old gag
When you touch my hand
At 4 a.m. we go out of this place
You look absurdly sweet
We hike downtown to avenue a
Like we own the street Chorus Out on the fringe
Where the shallows meet the scratchlands
Out where hope and the highway ends
You can park or cruise
Both ways you lose
This is flytown now my friend You take a walk on bleak street
Tonight could be the night you crash
Then you turn and stop
Start to fingerpop
You think you hear a wailin' combo
You climb a flight of twisted stairs
Some cat says buddy Chorus:
If you've got eyes
To rhythmatize
Bring your flat hat and your ax
'cause tonight at ten
We'll be workin' again
At the teahouse on the tracks The siegel bros. were slammin' out a baion
So slick it should have been a crime
Irene and flocko and little amy khan
Lead off the big front line
The crowd was bouncin' in sync with the pulse
You get a case of party feet
(then the room turns bright
And fills up with light)
And then from somewhere deep inside you
Some frozen stuff begins to crack
Better hurry Chorus:
Take the t-line to bleak and divine
Just above the good time flats
It's your last chance
To learn how to dance
At the teahouse on the tracks On sunday morning
You're back at the wheel
You're feelng calm and crisp and strong Chorus:
If it feels right
Just drive for the light
That's the groovessential facts
Someday we'll all meet at the end of the street
At the teahouse on the tracks Any news was good news
And the feeling was bad at home
I was out of mind and you
Were on the phone
Lonnie was the kingpin
Back in nineteen sixty-five
I was singing this song
When Lonnie came alive CHORUS:
Bring back the Boston Rag
Tell all your buddies
That it ain't no drag
Bring back the Boston Rag You were Lady Bayside
There was nothing that I could do
So I pointed my car down
Seventh Avenue
Lonnie swept the playroom
And he swallowed up all he found
It was forty-eight hours til
Lonnie came around CHORUS In the beginning
We could hang with the dude
But it's been too much of nothing
Of that stank attitude
Now they curse your name
And there's a bounty on your face
It's your own fault daddy
Godwhacker's on the case We track your almighty ass thru seven heaven worlds
Me, Slinky Redfoot
And our trusty Angel-girls
And when the stars bleed out
That be the fever of the chase
You better get gone poppie
Godwhacker's on the case Be very very quiet
Clock everything you see
Little things might matter later
At the start of the end of history Climb up the glacier
Across bridges of light
We sniff you, Big Tiger
In the forest of the night
'Cause there's no escape
From the Rajahs of Erase
Better run run run
Godwhacker's on the case Be very, very quiet
Clock everything you see
Little things might matter later
At the start of the end of history Yes we are the Godwhackers
Who rip and chop and slice
For crimes beyond imagining
It's time to pay the price
You better step back son
Give the man some whacking space
You know this might get messy
GodWhacker's on the case Little friend of mine
Can you still recall
Our salad days
Between the ivy walls?
Beneath the autumn sun?
When all is said and done
We were a good combination
We were good clean fun
Still my thoughts roll back
Every now and then
Think about you
Remembering
I start in smiling and
I just can't stop
You on the bottom
Me on top These days it's like a tomb
Amid in the stacks of gloom
Looking out the window
In the downstairs room
And the time goes by
And the time goes by
Sometimes it goes so slowly
You know a man could cry
Till the day goes down
In deep disgrace
With empty pockets
And a dirty face
And then the day boils over
And there's nothing there
But a roomful of smoke and a lot of hot air This moody bastard remembers
You were some kind of friend even then
Once in a great while
He needs one...
This moody bastard
This moody bastard
He needs one
He needs some kind of friend now and again
Once in blue moon
Could use one
This moody bastard Little friend of mine
You don't even know
When the wind starts blowing
How far a man could go
Little friend of mine
Are you even there
Did you disappear
Back into thin air
If you 're still here with me
If you got this far
I hope you're smiling
In fact I know you are This moody bastard remembers
You were some kind of friend even then
Once in a great while
He needs one...
This moody bastard
This moody bastard
He needs one
He needs some kind of friend now and again
Once in blue moon
Could use one
This moody bastard
This moody bastard

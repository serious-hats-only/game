Where do we go from here?
This isn't where we intended to be
We had it all, you believed in me
I believed in you
Certainties disappear
What do we do for our dream to survive?
How do we keep all our passions alive
As we used to do? Deep in my heart I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away You must love me
You must love me Why are you at my side?
How can I be any use to you now?
Give me a chance and I'll let you see how
Nothing has changed Deep in my heart I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away You must love me
You must love me You must love me Swinging in the backyard
Pull up in your fast car
Whistling my name Open up a beer
And you say, get over here
And play a video game I'm in his favorite sun dress
Watching me get undressed
Take that body downtown I say you the bestest
Lean in for a big kiss
Put his favorite perfume on Go play your video game It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you Baby, now you do Singing in the old bars Swinging with the old stars
Living for the fame
Kissing in the blue dark Playing pool and wild darts
Video games
He holds me in his big arms Drunk, and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of
Watching all our friends fall
In and out of Old Paul's This is my idea of fun
Playing video games It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby, now you do It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby, now you do Now you do Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the best I got my red dress on tonight
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feeling alive Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore
One, two, three, four Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the best I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh oh, oh oh I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruising down the coast goin' 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore
One, two, three, four Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh oh, oh oh Think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the morning skies
Later's better than never
Even if you're gone I'm gonna drive, drive, drive I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh oh, oh oh Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the best I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh oh, oh oh I know you
I walked with you once upon a dream.
I know you
That look in your eyes is so familiar a gleam And I know it's true
that visions are seldom all they seem
But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once
the way you did once upon a dream
But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once the way you did once upon a dream
I know you
I walked with you once upon a dream. I know you
That gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam
And I know it's true
that visions are seldom all they seem
But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once
the way you did once upon a dream Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room, you know you make my eyes burn
It was like James Dean for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
But you fit me better than my favourite sweater
And I know that love is mean, and love hurts
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh baby I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, say you'll remember
Oh baby, ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time Big dreams, gangsta
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like, no please, stay here
We don't need no money, we could make it all work
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waiting, anticipating and pacing
But he was chasing paper
Caught up in the game, that was the last I heard I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, say you'll remember
Oh baby, ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time You went out every night and baby that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did I'd be by your side
'Cause I'ma ride or die, whether you fail or fly
Well shit, at least you tried
But when you walked out the door a piece of me died
I told you I wanted more
That's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before
We were dancing all night
Then they took you away
Stole you out of my life
You just need to remember I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, say you'll remember
Oh baby, ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time I've seen the world
Done it all, had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now
Hot summer nights, mid July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, the city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful? I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in, the New Age now
Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful? Dear lord, when I get to heaven
Please let me bring my man
When he comes tell me that you'll let him in
Father tell me if you can
Oh that grace, oh that body
Oh that face makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds And will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will
I know that you will Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
Will you still love me when I'm not young and beautiful? Topanga is hot tonight, the city by the bay
Has movie stars and liquor stores and soft decay
The rumblin' from distant shores sends me to sleep
But the facts of life can sometimes make it hard to dream Life rocked me like Mötley
Grabbed me by the ribbons in my hair
Life rocked me ultra-softly
Like the heavy metal that you wear I'm flyin' to the moon again, dreamin' about heroin
How it gave you everything and took your life away
I put you on an aeroplane, destined for a foreign land
I hoped that you'd come back again
And tell me everything's okay, ay
Babe, yeah Topanga's hot today, Manson's in the air
And all my friends have come, 'cause they still feel him here
I want to leave, I'll probably stay another year
It's hard to leave when absolutely nothin's clear Life rocked me like Mötley
Bad beginnin' to my new year
Life rocked me ultra-softly
Like the heavy metal that you hear I'm flyin' to the moon again, dreamin' about heroin
And how it gave you everything and took your life away
I put you on the aeroplane, destined for a foreign land
I thought that you'd come back again
To tell me everything's okay, ay
Babe, yeah (It's fuckin' hot, hot) Winter in the city
Somethin' 'bout this weather made these kids go crazy
(It's hot) Even for February
Somethin' 'bout this sun has made these kids get scary
Oh, writin' in blood on my walls and shit
Like, "Oh my God"
Drippin' off from the walls into the ducts and shit
Oh, ho ho ho, I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't sick of it
Lead me (baby) come on (come on) come on (come on) I'm flyin' to the moon again, dreamin' about marzipan
Taking all my medicine to take my thoughts away
I'm getting on that aeroplane, leavin' my old man again
I hope that I come back one day
To tell you that I really changed, baby (It's hot, hot) Somethin' 'bout the city
Don't know what it is, it make's my head get crazy
Oh, makes me feel like I can change
Oh, ho ho ho, all of my evil ways and shit
Oh, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sick of it Down on the West coast, they got a sayin'
"If you're not drinkin', then you're not playin'"
But you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you? Down on the West coast, I get this feeling like
It all could happen, that's why I'm leaving
You for the moment, you for the moment
Boy Blue, yeah you You're falling hard, I push away
I'm feelin' hot to the touch
You say you miss me and I wanna say I miss you so much
But something keeps me really quiet
I'm alive, I'm a lush
Your love, your love, your love I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y Cubano como yo, l-love
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love Down on the West coast, they got their icons
Their silver starlets, their Queens of Saigons
And you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you? Down on the West coast, they love their movies
Their golden gods and Rock n' Roll groupies
And you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you? You push it hard, I pull away
I'm feeling hotter than fire
I guess that no one ever really made me feel that much higher
Te deseo, cariño, boy it's you I desire
Your love, your love, your love I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y Cubano como yo, l-love
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y Cubano como yo, l-love
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love I'm in love
I'm in love I've been out on that open road
You can be my full time daddy, white and gold
Singing blues has been getting old
But you can be my full time baby, hot or cold Don't break me down
I've been traveling too long
I've been trying too hard
With one pretty song I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride
Just ride
I just ride, I just ride Dying young and playing hard
That's the way my father made his life an art
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
That's the way the road dogs do it
Light 'til dark Don't leave me now
Don't say goodbye
Don't turn around
Leave me high and dry I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride
Just ride
I just ride, I just ride I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy
I'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes
It's all I've got to keep myself sane, baby
So I just ride, I just ride Hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride
Just ride
I just ride, I just ride My old man is a bad man, but
I can't deny the way he holds my hand
And he grabs me, he has me by my heart
He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have a LA crass way about me
He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart
Swimming pool glimmering, darling
White bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool
Bright blue ripples
You sitting, sipping on your Black Cristal, oh yeah Light of my life, fire of my loins
Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Gimme them gold coins
Gimme them coins And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Ready for you My old man is a tough man, but
He's got a soul as sweet as blood red jam
And he shows me, he knows me
Every inch of my tar-black soul
He doesn't mind I have a flat broke-down life
In fact he says he thinks it's what he might like about me
Admires me, the way I roll like a rolling stone
Likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom, Chateau Marmont
Slipping on my red dress, putting on my makeup
Glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac fumes
Says it feels like heaven to him Light of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you own me
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you own me
Gimme them coins And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth Yo, I'm off to the races, laces
Leather on my waist is tight and I am falling down
I can see your face is shameless
Cipriani's Basement
Love you, but I'm going down
God, I'm so crazy, baby
I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlot, starlet
Queen of Coney Island
Raising hell all over town
Sorry 'bout it My old man is a thief, and
I'm gonna stay and pray with him 'til the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord
To watch over us
Take him when he may, if He may
I'm not afraid to say that I'd die without him
Who else is gonna put up with me this way?
I need you, I breathe you, I'll never leave you
They would rue the day, I was alone without you
You're lying with your gold chain on
Cigar hanging from your lips
I said, "Hon', you never looked so beautiful
As you do now, my man" And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set, the gate is down
And now we're going in
To Las Vegas, chaos
Casino Oasis
Honey, it is time to spin
Boy, you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever, not maybe
You are my one true love

Fooling everyone, telling 'em she's having fun She says, "You don't want to be like me
Don't wanna see all the things I've seen
I'm dying, I'm dying"
She says, "You don't want to get this way
Famous and dumb at an early age
Lying, I'm lying" The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shinin'
Like lightning, woah
White lightning Carmen, Carmen
Stayin' up 'til morning
Only seventeen, but she walks the streets so mean
It's alarmin', truly, how disarmin' you can be
Eatin' soft ice cream
Coney Island queen She says, "You don't want to be like me
Looking for fun, gettin' high for free
I'm dying, I'm dying"
She says, "You don't want to get this way
Street walk at night, and a star by day
It's tiring, tiring" The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen

She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shinin'

Relyin' on the kindness of strangers
Tyin' cherry knots, smilin'
Doin' party favours
Put your red dress on, put your lipstick on
Sing your song, song, now the camera's on
And you're alive again Mon amour, je sais que tu m'aimes aussi

Tu ne peux vivre sans moi
Et je mourrais sans toi
Je tuerais pour toi The boys, the girls

A touch from your real love
Is like heaven takin' the place of somethin' evil
And lettin' it burn off from the rush, yeah, yeah
(Fuck!) Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you, I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme

And you just stay lined up, yeah
(Fuck!) Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you, I fall to pieces (bitch)
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined (bitch) My rose garden dreams, set on fire by fiends
And all my black beaches are ruined
My celluloid scenes are torn at the seams
And I fall to pieces (bitch)
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
(Why?) 'Cause I love you so much, I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined (bitch)
Are ruined (bitch)
Are ruined (fuck!) In the land of Gods and Monsters
I was an angel
living in the garden of evil
Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed
Shinin' like a fiery beacon You got that medicine I need
Fame, Liquor, Love, give it to me slowly
Put your hands on my waist, do it softly
Me and God we don't get along, so now I sing No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees sprees and I'm singing
'Fuck yeah give it to me this is heaven, what I truly want'
It's innocence lost
Innocence lost In the land of Gods and Monsters
I was an angel
Looking to get fucked hard
Like a groupie incognito posing as a real singer
Life imitates art You got that medicine I need
Dope, shoot it up, straight to the heart please
I don't really wanna know what's good for me
God's dead, I said 'baby, that's alright with me' No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees sprees and I'm singing
'Fuck yeah give it to me this is heaven, what I truly want'
It's innocence lost
Innocence lost When you talk it's like a movie
And you're makin' me crazy --
'Cause life imitates art
If I get a little prettier
Can I be your baby?
You tell me, "life isn't that hard" No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees sprees and I'm singing
'Fuck yeah give it to me this is heaven, what I truly want'
It's innocence lost
Innocence lost There's somethin' in the wind, I can feel it blowin' in
It's comin' in softly on the wings of a bomb
There's somethin' in the wind, I can feel it blowin' in
It's comin' in hotly and it's comin' in strong Lately, I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to sympathize when no one gave a damn?
I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to wanna try? But Change is a powerful thing, people are powerful bein's
Tryin' to find the power in me to be faithful
Change is a powerful thing, I feel it comin' in me
Maybe by the time Summer's done
I'll be able to be honest, capable
Of holdin' you in my arms without lettin' you fall
When I don't feel beautiful or stable
Maybe it's enough to just be where we are because Every time that we run, we don't know what it's from
Now we finally slow down, we feel close to it
There's a change gonna come
I don't know where or when
But whenever it does, we'll be here for it There's somethin' in the wind, I can feel it blowin' in
It's comin' in softly on the wings of a song
There's somethin' in the water, I can taste it turnin' sour
It's bitter, I'm coughin'
But now it's in my blood Lately, I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to sympathize when no one gave a damn?
I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
'Cause who am I to wanna try? But Change is a powerful thing, people are powerful bein's
Tryin' to find the power in me to be faithful
Change is a powerful thing, I feel it comin' in me
Maybe by the time Summer's done
I'll be able to be honest, capable
Of holdin' you in my arms without letting you fall
When I don't feel beautiful or stable
Maybe it's enough to just be where we are because Every time that we run, we don't know what it's from
Now we finally slow down, we feel close to it
There's a change gonna come
I don't know where or when
But whenever it does, we'll be here for it Yeah, whenever it does, we'll be here for it
Whenever it does, we'll be here for it Why? (hey, man!)
Who, me? (alright!)
Why? (hey, man!) Feet don't fail me now
Take me to the finish line
Oh, my heart, it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping at the gates
They'll tell me that you're mine Walking through the city streets
Is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home
If I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you, honey Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh
Let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I
We were born to die Lost, but now I am found
I can see, but once I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Tried to take what I could get
Scared that I couldn't find
All the answers, honey Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh
Let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So, choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I
We were born to die
We were born to die
We were born to die Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane So, don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh—let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So, choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die
We were born to die
We were born to die
(We were born to die) All my friends tell me I should move on
I'm lying in the ocean singing your song
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
That's how you sang it
Loving you forever can't be wrong
Even though you're not here, won't move on
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
That's how we played it And there's no remedy for memory
Your face is like a melody
It won't leave my head
Your soul is haunting me
And telling me that everything is fine
But I wish I was dead
(Dead, like you) Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side All my friends ask me why I stay strong
Tell 'em when you find true love, it lives on
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
That's why I stay here And there's no remedy for memory
Your face is like a melody
It won't leave my head
Your soul is haunting me
And telling me that everything is fine
But I wish I was dead
(Dead, like you) Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you, except in my dreams tonight Oh-oh-oh-hah-hah
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh-oh-oh-hah-hah
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight There's no relief, I see you in my sleep
And everybody's rushing me
But I can feel you touching me
There's no release, I feel you in my dreams
Telling me I'm fine Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
(Dead, like you)
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you except in my dreams tonight Oh-oh-oh-hah-hah
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh-oh-oh-hah-hah
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight And the spirit of John moved upon the face of the waters. And John said: "Let there be light." And there was light. And John saw that it was good. Dear John forgive us our sins. Creator of all, forgive us our sins. Thank you. I wanna tell you where you at. It was me on this campsite. And I'm gonna teach you how to be cowboys. And if you want to be tough cowboys. I don't wanna hear you cryin'. I don't wanna hear you belly aching. You gonna get on that horse on that ride. Don't be afraid. Wear your boots up high, your pants low. Lean your hat in the good way. (- Sex is a part of nature. I go along with nature!) When you get on that, don't be jerking on it. Just ride nice and still. You can do it, I believe you. Ride with the wind. Don't complain. Never say you're sorry 'cause sorry is a sign of weakness. I don't want you to hide from your mama because I will ran you back out. You are a good kid. All you little cowboys will do a good job for me. Make sure you do it, pilgrim, 'cause I'll be watching you. -Life can change on a dime. Sometimes you just have to gamble. -Yeah, baby, that's what it is. That's what it's all about. -Amen. Don't forget: Write to your mama. Body Electric Elvis is my daddy, Marilyn's my mother
Jesus is my bestest friend.
We don't need nobody 'cause we got each other
Or at least I pretend
We get down every Friday night
Dancin' and grindin' in the pale moonlight
Grand Ole Opry, we're feelin' alright
Mary prays the rosary for my broken mind
(So don't worry about)
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric
Sing the body electric
Sing the body electric
I'm on fire, sing that body electric
Whitman is my daddy, Monaco's my mother
Diamonds are my bestest friend
Heaven is my baby, suicide's her father
Opulence is the end
We get down every Friday night
Dancin' and grindin' in the pale moonlight
Grand Ole Opry, we're feelin' alright
Mary prays the rosary for my broken mind
(So don't worry about)
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric
Sing the body electric
Sing the body electric
I'm on fire, sing that body electric
My clothes still smell like you
And all the photographs say, that we're still young.
I pretend I'm not hurt
I go about the world like I'm havin' fun.
We get crazy every Friday night
I drop it like it's hot in the pale moonlight.
Grand Ole Opry, feelin' all right
Mary's swayin' softly, to her heart's delight
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric
Sing the body electric
Sing the body electric
I'm on fire, sing that body electric
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric, baby I sing the Body electric;
The armies of those I love engirt me, and I engirt them;
They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, (Man you've got to be crazy!)
And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the Soul Womanhood, and all that is woman - and the man that comes from woman
The womb, the tits, nipples, breast-milk, tears, laughter, weeping, love-looks, love-perturbations and rising
The voice, articulation
Language
Whispering, shouting aloud
Food, drink, pulse, digestion, sweat, sleep
Walking, swimming, poise on the hips
Leaping, reclining, embracing, arm-curving and tightening
The continual changes of the flex of the mouth
And around the eyes
The skin, the sun-burnt shade, freckles, hair
The curious sympathy one feels, when feeling with the hand the naked meat of the body
The circling rivers, the breath, and breathing it in and out
The beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence downward toward the knees
The thin red jellies within you or within me - the bones and the marrow in the bones
The exquisite realization of health;
O I say, these are not the parts and poems of the Body only, but of the Soul
O I say now these are the Soul!
Gods & Monsters In the land of Gods and Monsters
I was an Angel
Living in the garden of evil
Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed
Shining like a fiery beacon
You got that medicine I need
Fame, Liquor, Love give it to me slowly
Put your hands on my waist, do it softly
Me and God, we don't get along so now I sing
No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees sprees and I'm singing
'Fuck yeah give it to me this is heaven, what I truly
Want'
It's innocence lost
Innocence lost
In the land of Gods and Monsters
I was an Angel
Looking to get fucked hard
Like a groupie incognito posing as a real singer
Life imitates art
You got that medicine I need
Dope, shoot it up, straight to the heart please
I don't really wanna know what's good for me
God's dead, I said 'baby that's alright with me'
No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees sprees and I'm singing
'Fuck yeah give it to me this is heaven, what I truly
Want'
It's innocence lost
Innocence lost
When you talk it's like a movie and you're making me
Crazy
Cause life imitates art
If I get a little prettier can I be your baby?
You tell me, "life isn't that hard"
No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees sprees and I'm singing
'Fuck yeah give it to me this is heaven, what I truly
Want'
It's innocence lost
Innocence lost (- For I must have you or no one!) - "You know it's not always gonna be this way, right?"
- "Yeah."
- "So just chill, alright?"
- "Mhmm"
- "Alright."
- "Yeah." (Just remember, I'm always there for you.) (In honour of Jack's birthday tonight; I thought I bring somebody here tonight that Jack can jack off to. Are you ready? Ladies. -Lord Almighty, I feel my temperature rising) I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked
Dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix
Angel-headed hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night
Who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz
Who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated
Who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes hallucinating Arkansas and Blake-light tragedy among the scholars of war
Who were expelled from the academies for crazy & publishing obscene odes on the windows of the skull
Who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burning their money in wastebaskets and listening to the Terror through the wall
Who got busted in their pubic beards returning through Laredo with a belt of marijuana for New York
Who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in Paradise Alley, death, or purgatoried their torsos night after night
With dreams, with drugs, with waking nightmares And so, from being created in his likeness, to being banished for wanting to be too much like him, we were cast out, and the garden of Eden transformed in to the garden of Evil
Los Angeles, The city of Angels, A land of Gods and Monsters, The in-between realm where only the choices made from your free will, will decide your souls final fate
Some poets called it the entrance to the Underworld, but on some summer nights, it could feel like Paradise, Paradise Lost... Dear John, forgive us our sins. x2 Master of the universe, creator of all, forgive us our sins. Dear John, forgive us our sins. (You ask me why I love her? Well give me time, I'll explain
Have you ever seen a Kansas sunset or an Arizona rain?
Have you ever drifted on a bayou down Louisiana way?
Or watched a cold fog come drifting in over San Francisco Bay?
Have you heard a bobwhite calling in the Carolina pines
Or heard the bellow of a diesel at the Appalachia mines?
Does the call of Niagara thrill you when you hear her waters roar?
Or do you look with awe and wonder, Massachusetts shore
Brave new men who stepped on Plymounth's rock?
And do you think of them when you stroll along a New York City dock?
Have you seen a snowflake drifting in the Rockies, way up high?
Or seen the sun come blazing down from a bright Nevada sky?
Do you hail to the Columbia as she rushes to the sea
Or bow your head at Gettysburg at our struggle to be free?
You ask me why I love her? I've got a million reasons why:
It's my beautiful America, beneath God's wide, wide sky Bel Air Gargoyles standing at the front of your gate.
Trying to tell me to wait
But I can't wait to see you.
So I run like I'm mad to heaven's door.
I don't wanna be bad
I won't cheat you no more.
Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you.
Palm trees in the light
I can sleep late at night
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby.
Spotlight, bad baby, you've got a flair
For the violentest kind of love anywhere out there
Mon amour, sweet child of mine
You're divine.
Didn't anyone ever tell you
It's OK to shine?
Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you.
Palm trees in the light
I can sleep late at night.
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby.
Don't be afraid of me, don't be ashamed.
Walk in the way of my soft resurrection.
Idol of roses, iconic soul. I know your name.
Lead me to war with your brilliant direction.
Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you.
Palm trees in the light
I can sleep late at night.
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby
Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Grenadine sunshine, can you fade inside of mine
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby
(Your always on my mind, Your always on my mind) I don't belong in the world, that's what it is
Something separates me from other people
Everywhere I turn
There's something blocking my escape It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, it's mine
With drippin' peaches, I'm camera ready
Almost all the time But I still get lonely
And baby, only then do I let myself recline
Can I let go, and let your memory dance
In the ballroom of my mind
Across the county line It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin', if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dyin'
For somethin' real
That I've been dyin'
For somethin' real It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, I'm fine
Past Ventura and lenses plenty
In the white sunshine But you still can find me, if you ask nicely
Underneath the pines
With the daisies, feelin' hazy
In the ballroom of my mind
Across the county line It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin', if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dyin'
For somethin' real
That I've been dyin'
For somethin' real It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying', if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
The fact that I can't deal Packin' all my things for the summer
Lyin' on my bed, it's a bummer
'Cause I didn't call when I got your number
But I liked you a lot
Slippin' on my dress in soft filters
Everybody said you're a killer
But I couldn't stop the way I was feelin'
The day your record dropped The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang Caught up in my dreams and forgettin'
I've been actin' like armageddon
'Cause you held me in your arms just a little too tight
That's what I thought
Summer's meant for lovin' and leavin'
I was such a fool for believin' that you
Could change all the ways you've been livin'
But you just couldn't stop The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang And you're revvin' and revvin' and revvin' it up
And the sound, it was frightenin'
And you were gettin' a part of that
You're gonna hit me like lightnin' White Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Said you're a wild mustang You're gonna hit me like lightnin'
You're gonna hit me like lightnin' Remember how we used to party up all night?
Sneakin' out and looking for a taste of real life
Drinkin' in the small town firelight
(Pabst Blue Ribbon on ice)
Sweet sixteen, and we had arrived
Walking down the streets as they whistle, "Hi, hi!"
Stealin' police cars with the senior guys
Teachers said we'd never make it out alive There she was, my new best friend
High heels in her hand, swayin' in the wind
While she starts to cry
Mascara runnin' down her little Bambi eyes
"Lana, how I hate those guys" This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put our love first
Somethin' that we'd die for, it's our curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen And that's where the beginning of the end begun
Everybody knew that we had too much fun
We were skippin' school and drinkin' on the job
With the boss
Sweet sixteen, and we had arrived
Baby's table dancin' at the local dive
Cheering our names in the pink spotlight
Drinkin' cherry schnapps in the velvet night Yo, we used to go break into the hotel
Glimmering, we'd swim
Running from the cops in our black bikini tops
Screaming, "Get us while we're hot, get us while we're hot"
(C'mon, take a shot) This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put our love first
Somethin' that we'd die for, it's our curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen The prettiest in-crowd that you had ever seen
Ribbons in our hair, and our eyes gleamed mean
A freshmen generation of degenerate beauty queens
And you know somethin'?
They were the only friends I ever had
We got into trouble and when stuff got bad
I got sent away, I was waving on the train platform
Cryin' 'cause I know I'm never coming back This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put our love first
Somethin' that we'd die for, it's our curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address? I'm your national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em
Reckless abandon
Holding me for ransom, Upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair
Hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on", he said, "Yes, yes, yes..." Tell me I'm your national anthem
Booyah, baby, bow, down
Making me so wow now
Tell me I'm your national anthem
Sugar, sugar, how now
Take your body downtown
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact
Kiss, kiss I sing the national anthem
While I'm standing over your body, hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron
He said to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real
Don't you know who you're dealing with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds? Tell me I'm your national anthem
Booyah, baby, bow, down
Making me so wow now
Tell me I'm your national anthem
Sugar, sugar, how now
Take your body downtown
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Wining and dining, drinking and driving
Excessive buying, overdose and dying
On our drugs, and our love, and our dreams, and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well
I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress I'm your national anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of sweetness and danger
Queen of Saigon Tell me I'm your national anthem
Booyah, baby, bow, down
Making me so wow now
Tell me I'm your national anthem
Sugar, sugar, how now
Take your body downtown
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success Boy, look at you looking at me
I know you know how I feel
Loving you is hard, being here is harder
You take the wheel
I don't wanna do this anymore
It's so surreal, I can't survive
If this is all that's real All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by baby, baby, bye, bye
The truth is I never
Bought into your bullshit
When you would be pay tribute to me Cause I know that All I wanna do is get high by the beach Get high baby, baby, bye, bye Boy look at you
Looking at me
I know you don't understand
You could be a bad motherfucker
But that don't make you a man
Now you're just another one of my problems
Because you got out of hand
We won't survive
We're sinking into the sand
All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by baby, baby, bye, bye
The truth is I never
Bought into your bullshit
When you would be pay tribute to me

Everyone can start again
Not through love but through revenge
Through the fire, we're born again
Peace by patience

Summer's hot but I've been cold without you
I was so wrong not to tell, Medellín, tangerine dreams Catch me if you can, working on my tan, Salvatore

Soft ice cream Finally
I'm crossing the threshold
From the ordinary world
To the reveal of my heart
Undoubtedly That will for certain
Take the dead out of the sea
And the darkness from the arts This is my commitment
My modern manifesto
I'm doin' it for all of us
Who never got the chance For... and for... (shut up, shut up)
And all my birds of paradise (shut up, shut up)
Who never got to fly at night (shut up, shut up)
'Cause they were caught up in the dance Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do
I wanna move
Out of the black (out of the black)
Into the blue (into the blue) Finally Gone is the burden
Of the crowdin' way of bein'
That comes from energies combined
Like my part was I
Was not discernin'
And you, as we found out
Were not in your right mind There's no more chasin' rainbows
And hopin' for an end to them
Their arches are illusions
Solid at first glance
But then you try to touch them (touch, touch)
There's nothin' to hold on to (hold, hold)
The colors used to lure you in (shut up, shut up)
And put you in a trance (ah, ah, ah, yeah) Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do
I wanna move
Out of the black (out of the black)
Into the blue (into the blue)
Out of the black (out of the black)
Into the blue (into the blue)
Out of the black (out of the black)
Into the blue (into the blue) He used to call me DN
That stood for Deadly Nightshade
Cause I was filled with poison
But blessed with beauty and rage
Jim told me that
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
Jim brought me back
Reminded me of when we were kids With his Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that Ultraviolence He used to call me poison
Like I was poison ivy
I could have died right there
Cause he was right beside me
Jim raised me up
He hurt me but it felt like true love
Jim taught me that
Loving him was never enough With his Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that Ultraviolence We could go back to New York
Loving you was really hard
We could go back to Woodstock
Where they don't know who we are
Heaven is on Earth
I would do anything for you, babe
Blessed is this union
Crying tears of gold like lemonade I love you the first time, I love you the last time
Yo soy la princesa, comprende mis white lines
Cause I'm your jazz singer and you're my cult leader
I love you forever, I love you forever With his Ultraviolence
(lay me down tonight)
Ultraviolence
(in my linen and curls)
Ultraviolence
(lay me down tonight)
Ultraviolence
(Riviera Girls)
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that Ultraviolence All the pretty stars shine for you, my love

Blue eyes and jazz and attitude
He lives in California too
He drives a Chevy Malibu
And when he calls
He calls for me, and not for you
He lives for love, he loves his drugs
He loves his baby too But I can't fix him
Can't make him better
And I can't do nothing about
His strange weather But you
Are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you
Live in shades of cool
Your heart
Is unbreakable My baby lives in shades of cool
Cool heart and hands and aptitude
He lives for love, for women too
I'm one of many on his blue And when he calls
He calls for me, and not for you
He prays for love, he prays for peace
And maybe someone new But I can't help him
Can't make him better
And I can't do nothing about
His strange weather Cause you
Are unfixable
I can't break through your world
Cause you
Live in shades of cool
Your heart
Is unbreakable You
Are unfixable
I can't break through your world

'Cause I like you quite a lot, everything you got
Don't you know it's you that I adore?
Though I make the boys fall like dominoes Kiss me in the d-a-r-k dark tonight
(D-a-r-k, do it my way)
Kiss me in the p-a-r-k park tonight
(P-a-r-k, let them all say) Hey Lolita, hey!
Hey Lolita, hey!
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play
Hey Lolita, hey!
Hey Lolita, hey!
Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay
No more skippin' rope
Skippin' heartbeats with the boys downtown
Just you and me, feeling the heat
Even when the sun goes down I could be yours, I could be your baby tonight
Topple you down from your sky 40 stories high
Shinin' like a God
Can't believe I caught you, and so
Look at what I bought
Not a second thought—oh, Romeo Kiss me in the d-a-r-k dark tonight

Even when the sun goes down I want my cake and I want to eat it too
I want to have fun and be in love with you
I know that I'm a mess with my long hair
And my suntan, short dress, bare feet
I don't care what they say about me
What they say about me
Because I know that it's l-o-v-e
You make me happy, you make me happy
And I never listen to anyone
(Let them all say!) Hey Lolita, hey!

I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play
Hey Lolita, hey!
Hey Lolita, hey!
Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay
No more skippin' rope
Skippin' heartbeats with the boys downtown
Just you and me, feeling the heat
Even when the sun goes down Let's get out of this town, baby we're on fire
Everyone around here seems to be going down, down, down
If you stick with me, I can take you higher, and higher
It feels like all of our friends are lost
Nobody's found, found, found I got so scared, I thought no one could save me
You came along scooped me up like a baby Every now and then the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones? Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time Boy, get into my car, got a bad desire
You know that we'll never leave if we don't get out now, now, now
You're a careless con, and you're a crazy liar
But baby, nobody can compare to the way you get down, down, down I tried so hard to act nice like a lady
You taught me that it was good to be crazy Every now and then the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones? Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time Feels like, feels like, you know,
It feels like falling in love for the first time
Feels like, you know,
It feels like falling in love Every now and then the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones? Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time White lines, pretty baby, tattoos
Don't know what they mean
They're special, just for you
White palms, baking powder on the stove
Cooking up a dream, turning diamonds into snow I feel you, pretty baby, feel me
Turn it up hot, loving you is free
I like it down, like it down way low
But you already know that
You already know Come on down to Florida
I got something for ya
We could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh ya
Guns in the summertime
Chic-a-Cherry Cola lime
Prison isn't nothing to me if you'll be by my side Yayo, yayo, yayo
And all the dope fiends
Yayo, yayo, yayo Sun in my mouth and gold hoops

Mm-mm, pretty baby
White lines, pretty baby
Gold teeth, pretty baby
Dance the night away Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Cashmere, cologne and white sunshine
Red racing cars, Sunset and Vine
The kids were young and pretty
Where have you been? Where did you go?
Those summer nights seem long ago
And so is the girl you used to call
The Queen of New York City But if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, come The power of youth is on my mind
Sunsets, small town, I'm out of time
Will you still love me when I shine?
From words but not from beauty
My father's love was always strong
My mother's glamour lives on and on
Yet still inside, I felt alone
For reasons unknown to me But if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, come And if you call
I'll run, run, run
If you change your mind
I'll come, come, come Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Cashmere, cologne and hot sunshine
Red racing cars, Sunset and Vine
And we were young and pretty You said I was the most exotic flower
Holding me tight in our final hour
I don't know how you convince them and get them, boy
I don't know what you do
It's unbelievable
And I don't know how you get over, get over
Someone as dangerous, tainted and flawed as you One for the money, and two for the show
I love you honey
I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way? I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
You look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke? You got the world, but baby at what price?
Something so strange, hard to define
It isn't that hard boy to like you or love you
I'd follow you down, down, down
You're unbelievable
If you're going crazy just grab me and take me
I'd follow you down, down, down
Anywhere, anywhere One for the money, two for the show
I love you honey
I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way? I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
You look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke? One for the money, and two for the show
I love you honey
I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way? I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
You look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke? I don't know
You're screwed up, you're brilliant
You look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke? Everything I want I have
Money, notoriety and rivieras
I even think I found God
In the flash bulbs of the pretty cameras
Pretty cameras, pretty cameras
Am I glamorous? Tell me, am I glamorous? Hello? Hello?
C-can you hear me?
I can be your China doll
If you want to see me fall
Boy, you're so dope
Your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful
They all think I have it all
I'm nothing without you All my dreams and all the lights mean Nothing without you Summertime is nice and hot
And my life is sweet like vanilla is
Gold and silver line my heart But burned into my brain are these stolen images
Stolen images, baby, stolen images Can you picture it?
Baby, the life we could've lived? Hello? Hello?
C-can you hear me?
I can be your China doll
If you like to see me fall
Boy, you're so dope Your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful
They all think I have it all I'm nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you
We were two kids, just tryin' to get out Live on the dark side of the American dream
We would dance all night, play our music loud

Certainties disappear
What do we do for our dream to survive?
How do we keep all our passions alive
As we used to do? Deep in my heart I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away You must love me
You must love me Why are you at my side?
How can I be any use to you now?
Give me a chance and I'll let you see how
Nothing has changed Deep in my heart I'm concealing

So it'd suit the mood of your soul Oh

Nothing
My sparrow blue Oh

Life is beautiful
But you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence
it don't make sense to you Black beauty

My wedding dress black leather too

Love is lost on you
I keep my lips red
To seem like cherries in the spring

To turn you on
Or get through you Oh

Oh Sometimes I wake up in the morning
To red, blue, and yellow skies
It's so crazy I could drink it like tequila sunrise
Put on that Hotel California
Dance around like I'm insane
I feel free when I see no one
And nobody knows my name God knows I live
God knows I died
God knows I begged
Begged, borrowed and cried
God knows I loved
God know I lied
God knows I lost
God gave me life
And God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried Sometimes I wake up in the morning
To red, blue and yellow lights
On Monday they destroyed me
But by Friday I'm revived
Put on that hotel California
Wear my blinders in the rain
I've got nothing much to live for
Ever since I found my fame God knows I live
God knows I died
God knows I loved
God knows I lied
God knows I begged
Begged, borrowed and cried
God knows I lost
God gave me life
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried So let there be light
Let there be light
Light up my life
Light up my life
Let there be light
Let there be light
Light up my life
Light up my life God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried Boy, it's late, walk me home, put your hand in mine
At the gate, stop and say, "Be my valentine"
You are, by far, the brightest star I've ever seen
And I never dreamed
I'd be so happy that I could die You used to say that I was beautiful like Cleopatra
But you the king too so I would say, "Back at ya"
I flip my hair and make you stare and put my makeup on
And make up stories 'bout my life and that I'm very cherry bomb
And even then I knew that we were something serious
That you would dominate my thoughts like radio to Sirius
I'd see you in the hall like, "Hello, hello"
Up against the wall like, "Let's go, let's go" Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste
Within this teenage wasteland You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place now
Baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me? If you're lonely, baby, hold me, you're my only one
Watching television, kissing 'til we see the sun
So far, we are safe in the dark
And I never dreamed that I'd be the queen
And I'd be so happy that I could die You used to call yourself The Don and call me Queen Diana
You always make me blush and say, "Shut up boy, you bananas!"
You pull my hair and push me down and chase me, make me run
You played me Biggie Smalls and then my first Nirvana song
So even then when no one's friends were really serious
I knew you loved me by the way you looked in second period
I'd see you in the hall like, "Hello, hello"
Up against the wall like, "Let's go, let's go" Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste
Within this teenage wasteland You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place now
Baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me? I know that they say that all I want is to have fun
And get away for rainy days
I know that they think I've come undone
But I'm in love
I wanna run, run, run away
I'm leaving, are you coming with me? Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste
Within this teenage wasteland You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place now
Baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me? We both know that it's not fashionable to love me
But you don't go cause truly there's nobody for you but me
We could cruise to the blues
Wilshire Boulevard if we choose
Or whatever you want to do
We make the rules Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon Say you want me too
Say you want me too
Dark blue
Dark blue We both know the history of violence that surrounds you
But I'm not scared, there's nothing to lose now that I've found you
We could cruise to the news
Pico blvd in you used little bullet car if we choose Mr. Born to lose Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon Say you want me too
Say you want me too
Dark blue
Dark blue There are violets in your eyes
There are guns that blaze around you
There are roses in between my thighs and fire that surrounds you
It's no wonder every man in town had neither fought nor found you Everything you do is elusive to even your honey dew Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon Dreaming away your life
Dreaming away your life
Dreaming away your life Flames so hot that they turn blue
Palms reflecting in your eyes,
Like an endless summer.
That's the way I feel for you.
If time stood still, I'd take this moment
Make it last forever. Your halo's full of fire.
I'm rising up, rising up.
My hot love's full of fire,
Love's full of fire.
Ahhh. Baby, if you wanna leave
Come to California
Be a freak like me, too.
Screw your anonymity,
Loving me is all you need to feel
Like I do.
We could slow dance to Rock music,
Kiss while we do it,
Talk 'til we both turn blue.
Baby, if you wanna leave
Come to California
Be a freak like me, too. Leather black and eyes of blue
(blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue)
Sun reflecting in your eyes,
Like an easy rider.
Life makes sense when I'm with you.
Looking back, my past,
It all seems stranger than a stranger. So let's dance in slow motion.
Tear it up, tear it up.
Let's dance by the ocean.
Ahhh. Baby, if you wanna leave
Come to California
Be a freak like me, too.
Screw your anonymity,
Loving me is all you need to feel
Like I do.
We could slow dance to Rock music,
Kiss while we do it,
Talk 'til we both turn blue.
Baby, if you wanna leave
Come to California
Be a freak like me, too. Ooh, You're cold as ice, baby
But when you're nice, baby
You're so amazing in every way.
Ooh, You're cold as ice, baby
I don't wanna fight, baby
It's like I told you
If you stay, I'll stay, yeah. Baby, if you wanna leave
Come to California
Be a freak like me, too.
(Take it to the back if you really wanna talk)
Screw your anonymity,
Loving me is all you need to feel,
Like I do.
We could slow dance to Rock music,
Kiss while we do it,
Talk 'til we both turn blue.
Baby, if you wanna leave
Come to California
Be a freak like me, too. Carry me home, got my blue nail polish on
It's my favorite color and my favorite tone of song
I don't really wanna break up, we got it going on
It's what you gathered from my talk, but you were wrong
It's not easy for me to talk about
I have heavy heartstrings
I'm not simple, it's trigonometry
It's hard to express
I can't explain
Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day, it's been the blackest day All I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play
Because I'm going deeper and deeper
Harder and harder Getting darker and darker
Looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh my god
In all the wrong places
Oh my god
Carry me home, got my new car and my gun
Wind in my hair, holding your hand, listen to a song Carry me home, don't wanna talk about the things to come
Just put your hands up in the air, the radio on
Cause there's nothing for us to talk about
Like the future and those things
Cause there's nothing for me to think about
Now that he's gone, I can't feel nothing
Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day, it's been the blackest day
All I hear is Billie Holiday It's all that I play
It's all that I play
Because I'm going deeper and deeper
Harder and harder
Getting darker and darker Looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh my god
In all the wrong places
Oh my god
You should've known better
Than to have, to let her
Get you under her spell of the weather I got you where I want you
You're deader than ever
And falling for forever
I'm playing head games with you
Got you where I want you
I got you, I got you
I got you where I want you now
Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day, it's been the blackest day All I hear is Billie Holiday It's all that I play
It's all that I play
It's not one of those phases I'm going through
Or just a song, it's not one of them
I'm on my own
On my own
On my own again
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own again Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Why work so hard when you could just be free?
You got your moment now, you got your legacy
Let's leave the world for the ones who change everything
Nothing could stop the two of us
Let's just get lost, that's what we want And I will never sing again
And you won't work another day
I will never sing again
With just one wave it goes away
It will be our swan song
It will be our swan song
Be our swan song
It will be our swan song Darling, dive deep and dark blue suede
Rushing up from the water where the ice meets
And you've been gone so long, you missed everything
The world can change in a day if you go away
But nothing could stop the two of us
That's what we want
We could just get lost And I will never sing again
And you won't work another day
I will never sing again
With just one wave it goes away
It will be our swan song
It will be our swan song
Be our swan song
It will be our swan song Live your life
Live your life, where you've been
Where you're going to (going to)
Say good night
Say good night to the life in the world we live
I'm going to follow you And I will never sing again
And you won't work another day
And I will never sing again
You won't work another day
It will be our swan song
It will be our swan song
Be our swan song
Be our swan song Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Why you work so hard when you could just be free In the land of Gods and Monsters,
I was an Angel.
Living in the garden of evil,
Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I Needed.
Shining like a fiery beacon,
You got that medicine I need
Fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly.
Put your hands on my waist, do it softly.
Me and God we don't get along, so now I sing. No one's gonna take my soul away,
I'm living like Jim Morrison.
Headed towards a fucked up holiday.
Motel, squeeze, squeeze, and I'm singing;
Fuck yeah give it to me, this is heaven, what I Truly want
It's innocence lost. Innocence lost. In the land of gods and monsters,
I was an Angel,
Lookin' to get fucked hard.
Like a groupie incognito posing as a real singer,
Life imitates art
You got that medicine I need
Dope, shoot it up straight to the heart please
I don't really wanna know what's good for me
God's dead, I said 'baby that's alright with me'. No one's gonna take my soul away,
Living like Jim Morrison.
Headed towards a fucked up holiday.
Motel, sprees, sprees, and I'm singing;
Fuck yeah give it to me, this is heaven, what I Truly want
It's innocence lost. Innocence lost. When you talk it's like a movie
Making me go crazy
'Cause life imitates art
If I'll get a little pretty
Can I be your baby?
And tell me life isn't that hard. No one's gonna take my soul away,
Living like Jim Morrison.
Headed towards a fucked up holiday.
Motel, sprees, sprees, and I'm singing;
Fuck yeah give it to me, this is heaven, what I Truly want
It's innocence lost. Innocence lost. The other woman has time to manicure her nails
The other woman is perfect where her rival fails
And she's never seen with pin curls in her hair anywhere The other woman enchants her clothes with French perfume
The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
There are never toys that's scattered everywhere And when her old man comes to call
He finds her waiting like a lonesome queen
'Cause to be by her side
It's such a change from old routine The other woman will always cry herself to sleep
The other woman will never have his love to keep
And as the years go by, the other woman
Will spend her life alone
Alone
Alone It's never too late
To be who you wanna be
To say what you wanna say
And it's never too late
To leave if you wanna leave
Or to stay if you wanna stay
But, baby
I got a feeling in my bones
Can't get you out of my veins
You can't escape my affection
Wrap you up in my daisy chains Hip-hop in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe
High tops in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe Uh, her sophistication makes you wanna quit the bitch you datin'
Let's skip the games, let's quit the playin'
Boo, let's get acquainted
Notifications sync in place even when we're on vacation
I knew she'd notice like I missed the payment, dang it
But bang it like my fingers
She pray to God I made it
But bankin' like my Franklins
My neighbors stopped the hatin'
What?
Huh?
Slide inside it
Diddy Boppin'
Milly Rockin'
She just might become my lover for real
I might fuck with her all summer for real
They better not holla if I cuff her for real
Niggas better run for cover for real
Goin' bell how I feel, close the deal, pop a seal
Take the whip, two pills on the lips on the real Truthfully between you and me I'm usually single
When it's hot outside this, I ride through any hood with the top out
Hop out Hip-hop in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe
High tops in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe, mmm White lights and black beaches
Miles in between us
Is this love or lust or some game on repeat?
It's like making me crazy
Tell me, "have patience"
Baby, I need this
White lines and black beaches
White lights and black beaches
And blood red sangrias
We traveled for weeks
Just to escape your demons
But you've got your reasons
For making me crazy

White lights and black beaches Like doves in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe

I've got a burning desire She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light
From the stars She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet were her eyes
Warmer than May her tender sighs
Love was ours Ours a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left gone was glow of Blue velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm a memory
Through the years And I still can see blue velvet through my tears I like you a lot

I've got nothing to hide, now
And now life's a dream
Life's a dream Everything is fine now

All our minds made up now
All our beds are made
No one's out of time, no
Chips fall wherever they may

It never was about the party or the clubs
For you there's only love Cause you're my religion

When I'm down on my knees, you're how I pray
I need your love

No more cloudy days, even when
The storms come, in the eye we'll stay
No need to survive now

A little party never hurt no one, that's why it's alright
You want in but you just can't win
So you hang in the likes You're so Art Deco
Out on the floor
Shining like gun medal cold and unsure

You're looking to score
When they all say hello
You try to ignore them
Cause you want more (Why?)
You want more (Why?)

Nothing if I can't have you. You taste like the Fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my
I love you but I don't know why... You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce
I like you a lot, I like you a lot
Don't let it stop... You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Don't let it stop... He had a cigarette with his number on it
He gave it over to me, "Do you want it?"
I knew it was wrong but I palmed it
I saved it, I waited, I called it
The liquor on your lips, the liquor on your lips
The liquor on your lips makes you dangerous
I knew it was wrong, I'm beyond it
I tried to be strong but I lost it. You taste like the Fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my... You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce
I like you a lot, I like you a lot
Don't let it stop... You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Don't let it stop... He has a white Corvette like I want it
A fire in his eyes, no, I saw it
He's bleeding from his brain and his wallet
He's sick and he's taken but honest
The liquor on your lips, the liquor on your lips
The liquor on his lips I just can't resist
As close as I'll get to the darkness
He tells me to "Shut up, I got this." You taste like the Fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my... You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce
I like you a lot, I like you a lot
Don't let it stop... You can be the boss, daddy

Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Don't let it stop... I need you, I need you babe
Like I never needed anyone
You're wrong but you're so much fun
You say you treat 'em mean to keep 'em keen - you're not that nice But you taste like the Fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my... You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce
I like you a lot, I like you a lot
Don't let it stop... You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Don't let it stop... If you get lonely think of me only
Prison isn't going to keep me from you
Remember Coney Island and how we'd
Wade into the water 'til the waves turned blue Nobody does have to know
That our love's alive
Keep it on the low
If you want to hide
Got that same address
If you want to write
One Greenwich Avenue
Wishin' and thinkin' of you Living without you is like TV in black and white
You turn me on and brought colour into my life
When I'm around you suddenly I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes If you get lonely think of this only
Heaven hasn't forgotten about you oh
Though you can't hold me
Pick up and phone me
Use your one phone call on your ex girl boo I won't tell a single soul
How you spend your nights
In your single cell
Holding your pillow tight
If you really are afraid
Then you ought to know
That you're the one I want the one I want
Forever more Living without you is like TV in black and white
You turn me on and brought colour into my life
When I'm around you suddenly I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes I know you get scared sometimes boy
Nothing to be feared when you're in my heart
Troubles come in threes but in your case
They came in millions and trillions but that's alright Living without you is like TV in black and white
You turn me on and brought colour into my life
When I'm around you suddenly I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes Like TV in black and white
Like TV in black and white
Like TV in black and white Like TV in black and white I won't cry myself to sleep like a sucker
I won't cry myself to sleep
If I do I'll die
Now you fall asleep with another
Damn you Remember how we used to escape for the summer
Fireworks and sparklers would light up the black skies
We'd hold on tight for our lives to each other
Hello, hello, where did you go? We were two kids living life on the run
Like the american dream
Baby, nothing to lose
And we get messed up for fun
We went too fast, too young But I won't cry myself to sleep like a sucker
I won't cry myself to sleep
If I do I'll die
Now you fall asleep with another
Damn you
Damn you Flowers in my hair and your breath smelled like whiskey
Promised anywhere that I go, take you with me
Dancing on your feet like a child to the radio
Hello, hello, where did you go? We were two kids living life on the run
Of the american dream
Baby, nothing to lose
And we get messed up for fun
We went too fast, too young But I won't cry myself to sleep like a sucker
I won't cry myself to sleep
If I do I'll die
Now you fall asleep with another
Damn you
Damn you
Damn you
Damn you Every once in a lifetime
Dreams can come true
Now and then when the stars shine
You meet somebody like you And I won't cry myself to sleep like a sucker
I won't cry myself to sleep
If I do I'll die
I pray your life is sweet, you fucker
Damn you
Oh, oh
Damn you
Damn you Hi ya honey, what you doing?
I've been hula-hooping
Waiting for you, oh ah Woah, haters, fakers, mass manipulators
Don't know what you're trying to prove I'm the new york city queen, queen
You should hear me sing, sing
Baby, i'm the real thing check, 1, 2
Stop looking at my trainwreck life
And start listening to the way i sing the blues You know, i know what they say about me
I know they think i'm danger
So what if it makes me happy, happy, happy It doesn't really matter what you say
Cause i ain't gonna quit till the day i die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots
Making out in parking lots with any little boy i spot
Baby, you can't stop me, stop me no
When i'm hot, i'm hot Hi ya honey, how's it going?
Saw you skipping rope on tv
Looking blue, oh ah You're shaking, making music and you're famous
Deep down you're the same girl i knew She said: "i know what they say about you
I know that they think you're crazy
I know that they are mistaken, baby, baby" It doesn't really matter what they say
Cause i ain't gonna quit till the day i die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots
Making out in parking lots with any little boy i spot
Baby, you can't stop me, stop me no
When i'm hot, i'm hot Singing for the gangsters
Chasing all that paper
Living life so dangerously
And there's nothing for my anchor
Money is my savior
I can be whatever i think
It's like heaven, heaven
Living on the edge
Never knowing where i'm going to be
And i'm dreading ever
Settling down that's when
Dying is beginning to gleam It doesn't really matter what you say
Cause i ain't gonna change till the day i die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots
Making out in parking lots with any little boy i spot
Honey, you can't stop me, stop me no
When i'm hot, i'm hot Ah ah ah ah
Oh oh oh oh... You are what you are
I don't matter to anyone
But Hollywood legends will never grow old
And all of what's hidden
Well, it will never grow cold But I lost myself when I lost you
But I still got jazz when I've got those blues
And I lost myself when I lost you
And I still get trashed, darling, when I hear your tunes But you are who you are
I won't change you for anything
For when you are crazy
I'll let you be bad
I'll never dare change thee to what you are not But I lost myself when I lost you
But I still got jazz when I've got those blues
I lost myself and I lost you too
And I still get trashed, baby, when I hear your tunes I put the radio on, hold you tight in my mind
Isn't strange that you're not here with me
But I'm putting all the lights on in the television
Trying to transmit, can you hear me?
Ground control to Major Tom
Can you hear me all night long?
Ground control to Major Tom Well I lost myself when I lost you
But I still got jazz when I've got the blues
I lost myself and I lost you too
And I still get trashed, honey, when I hear your tunes Mmmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmmm
Mmmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmmm Let's go!
When you got her in the back seat
Drivin' round the back streets
Trying to block me out
Do you remember my name? Cruising down Santa Monica Boulevard
Does it light up the spark?
Do you remember my name? Is she a Ride or Die bitch?
Does she know I'm tattooed onto your heart?
You can try to fight it
I have left my mark on you
There is nothing you can do When you think you're over me
And your bad baby is dead and gone
Remember I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real life suicide blonde You think that
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me, she's not me When you take her to Chateau Marmont
'Cause you booked the top suite
Lay her on the bed
Do you remember my name? Strip her down to her bare ass
In her "Kiki Montparnasse"
Like I used to have
Do you remember my name? Is she a Ride or Die bitch?
Does she make you shiver under your skin
Just the way that I did?
It won't be the same again
She don't compare to who I am When you think you're over me
And your bad baby is dead and gone
Remember I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real life suicide blonde You think that
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me You try to forget and you tell her that you miss her
But I bet every time you go to kiss her
You get a hot rush feeling on your lips
It's me taking over you, throwing you a curved ball Reminding you of our true romancin'
Just like the first time, you learned to dance and
And I showed you all those moves she can't do
She's not me (me, me, me) When you think you're over me
And your bad baby is dead and gone
Remember I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real life suicide blonde You think that
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me When you think you're over me
And your bad baby is dead and gone
Remember I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real life suicide blonde You think that
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me Girls, don't forget your pearls
And all of your horses
As you make your way across the pond
Girls, don't forget your curls
And all of your corsets
Memorize them in a little song Shake it up, throw your hands up and get loose
Cut a rug, lean into the fuckin' youth
Choreo, we just want the fuckin' truth
(Told by the frightened) Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
No, it's only the beginnin'
If we hold on to hope, we'll have a happy endin'
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin'
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin' Boys, don't forget your toys
And take all of your money
If you find you're in a foreign land
Boys, don't make too much noise
And don't try to be funny
Other people may not understand Shake it up, throw your hands up and get loose
Cut a rug, lean into the fuckin' youth
Choreo, we just want the fuckin' truth
(Told by the frightened) Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
No, it's only the beginning
If we hold on to hope, we'll have a happy endin'
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin'
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin' And we'll do it again
Oh my god, did it from lovin' you
From do it again
Oh my god, did it from lovin' you
We'll do it again
Did it from, did it from lovin' you
We'll do it again
When the world was at war Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin'
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin' And we'll do it again
And we'll do it again

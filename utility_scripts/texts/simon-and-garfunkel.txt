Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence "Fools" said I, "You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you"
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming And the sign said, "The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls"
And whispered in the sounds of silence When you're weary, feeling small
When tears are in your eyes, I'll dry them all (all)
I'm on your side, oh, when times get rough
And friends just can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you (ooo)
I'll take your part, oh, when darkness comes
And pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down Sail on silver girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine
Oh, if you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind I am just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocket full of mumbles, such are promises
All lies and jests
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared,
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places
Only they would know Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores
On Seventh Avenue
I do declare
There were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there, le le le le le le le Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone
Going home
Where the New York City winters
Aren't bleeding me
Leading me
Going home In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of ev'ry glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
"I am leaving, I am leaving"
But the fighter still remains, mmm mmm Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie

And whispered in the sounds of silence I hear the drizzle of the rain
Like a memory it falls
Soft and warm continuing
Tapping on my roof and walls And from the shelter of my mind
Through the window of my eyes
I gaze beyond the rain-drenched streets
To England where my heart lies My mind's distracted and diffused
My thoughts are many miles away
They lie with you when you're asleep
And kiss you when you start your day And a song I was writing is left undone
I don't know why I spend my time
Writing songs I can't believe
With words that tear and strain to rhyme And so you see I have come to doubt
All that I once held as true
I stand alone without beliefs
The only truth I know is you And as I watch the drops of rain
Weave their weary paths and die
I know that I am like the rain
There but for the grace of you go I Cecilia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please to come home Cecilia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please to come home
Come on home Making love in the afternoon with Cecilia
Up in my bedroom (making love)
I got up to wash my face
When I come back to bed someone's taken my place Cecilia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please to come home
Come on home Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba Jubilation
She loves me again
I fall on the floor and I'm laughing Jubilation
She loves me again
I fall on the floor and I'm laughing Whoah-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoah-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Whoah-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together
I've got some real estate here in my bag
So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner's pies
And we walked off to look for America
Cathy, I said as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh
Michigan seems like a dream to me now
It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw
I've gone to look for America Laughing on the bus, playing games with the faces
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
I said, be careful, his bowtie is really a camera
Toss me a cigarette, I think there's one in my raincoat
We smoked the last one an hour ago
So I looked at the scenery
She read her magazine
And the moon rose over an open field Cathy, I'm lost, I said though I knew she was sleeping
And I'm empty and aching and I don't know why
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike
They've all come to look for America
All come to look for America
All come to look for America And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know
Wo wo wo
God bless you, please, Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files
We'd like to help you learn to help yourself
Look around you all you see are sympathetic eyes
Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson,
Jesus loves you more than you will know
Wo wo wo
God bless you, please, Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey Hide it in the hiding place where no one ever goes
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes
It's a little secret just the Robinson's affair
Most of all you've got to hide it from the kids Koo-koo-ka-choo, Mrs. Robinson,
Jesus loves you more than you will know
Wo wo wo
God bless you, please, Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
Hey, hey, hey hey, hey, hey Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon
Going to the candidates' debate
Laugh about it, shout about it
When you've got to choose
Every way you look at this you lose Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio
Our nation turns its lonely eyes to you
Wu wu wu
What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson
Jolting Joe has left and gone away
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey Is it a kind of a dream
Floating out on the tide
Following the river of death downstream
Oh, is it a dream?
There's a fog along the horizon
A strange glow in the sky
And nobody seems to know where it goes
And what does it mean?
Oh, is it a dream? Bright eyes, burning like fire
Bright eyes, how can you close and fail?
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale?
Bright eyes Is it a kind of a shadow
Reaching into the night
Wandering over the hills unseen
Or is it a dream?
There's a high wind in the trees
A cold sound in the air
And nobody ever knows when you go
And where do you start?
Oh, into the dark Bright eyes, burning like fire
Bright eyes, how can you close and fail?
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale?
Bright eyes Bright eyes, burning like fire
Bright eyes, how can you close and fail?
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale?
Bright eyes I'm sitting in the railway station.
Got a ticket to my destination.
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand.
And every stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band.
Homeward bound,
I wish I was,
Homeward bound,
Home where my thought's escaping,
Home where my music's playing,
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me. Every day's an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines.
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories
And every stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,
Homeward bound,
I wish I was,
Homeward bound,
Home where my thought's escaping,
Home where my music's playing,
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me. Tonight I'll sing my songs again,
I'll play the game and pretend.
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.
Homeward bound,
I wish I was,
Homeward bound,
Home where my thought's escaping,
Home where my music's playing,
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me.
Silently for me. I'd rather be a sparrow than a snail
Yes I would, if I could, I surely would
I'd rather be a hammer than a nail
Yes I would, if I only could, I surely would Away, I'd rather sail away
Like a swan that's here and gone
A man gets tied up to the ground
He gives the world it's saddest sound
Its saddest sound I'd rather be a forest than a street
Yes I would, if I could, I surely would
I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet
Yes I would, if I only could, I surely would Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Without no seam nor needlework
Then she'll be a true love of mine Tell her to find me an acre of land
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Between the salt water and the sea strand
Then she'll be a true love of mine Tell her to reap it in a sickle of leather
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
And to gather it all in a bunch of heather
Then she'll be a true love of mine Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine Slow down, you move too fast
You got to make the morning last
Just kicking down the cobblestones
Looking for fun and feeling groovy
Ba da-da da-da da-da, feeling groovy Hello lamppost, what'cha knowing
I've come to watch your flowers growin'
Ain't cha got no rhymes for me?
Doo-ait-n-doo-doo, feeling groovy
Ba da-da da-da da-da, feeling groovy I got no deeds to do, no promises to keep
I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep
Let the morningtime drop all its petals on me
Life, I love you, all is groovy My daddy was the family bassman
My mamma was an engineer
And I was born one dark gray morn
With music coming in my ears
In my ears They call me Baby Driver
And once upon a pair of wheels
I hit the road and I'm gone
What's my number
I wonder how your engines feel
Ba ba ba ba
Scoot down the road
What's my number
I wonder how your engines feel
Shine a light, ooo ooo oo, ooo ooo oo My daddy was a prominent frogman
My mamma's in the Naval reserve
When I was young I carried a gun
But I never got the chance to serve
I did not serve They call me Baby Driver
And once upon a pair of wheels
I hit the road and I'm gone
What's my number
I wonder how your engines feel
Ba ba ba ba
Scoot down the road
What's my number
I wonder how your engines feel Ba ba ba ba, mmm ba ba ba ba My daddy got a big promotion
My mamma got a raise in pay
There's no one home, we're all alone
Oh come into my room and play
Yes we can play I'm not talking about your pigtails
But I'm talking 'bout your sex appeal
I hit the road and I'm gone
What's my number I wonder how your engines feel
Ba ba ba ba
Scoot down the road
What's my number
I wonder how your engines feel To oo ooo to oo ooo to oo ooo oo ooo oo ooo oo ooo I'd rather be a sparrow than a snail

Its saddest sound I'd rather be a forest than a street
Yes I would, if I could, I surely would
I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet
Yes I would, if I only could, I surely would Old friends, old friends,
Sat on their parkbench like bookends
A newspaper blown through the grass
Falls on the round toes
of the high shoes of the old friends Old friends, winter companions, the old men
Lost in their overcoats, waiting for the sun
The sounds of the city sifting through trees
Settles like dust on the shoulders of the old friends Can you imagine us years from today,
Sharing a parkbench quietly
How terribly strange to be seventy Old friends, memory brushes the same years,
Silently sharing the same fears In my little town, I grew up believing
God keeps his eye on us all.
And he used to lean upon me as I pledged allegiance to the wall.
Lord, I recall, in my little town,
Comin' home after school, flyin' my bike past the gates of the factories,
My mom doin' the laundry, hangin' out shirts in the dirty breeze.
And after it rains there's a rainbow and all of the colors are black.
It's not that the colors aren't there, it's just imagination they lack.
Everything's the same back in my little town,
My little town, my little town. Nothin' but the dead and dyin' back in my little town.
Nothin' but the dead and dyin' back in my little town. In my little town, I never meant nothin',
I was just my father's son. mmm.
Savin' my money, dreamin' of glory,
Twitchin' like a finger on the trigger of a gun. Leavin' nothin' but the dead and dying back in my little town.
Nothin' but the dead and dyin' back in my little town.
Nothin' but the dead and dyin' back in my little town.
Nothin' but the dead and dyin' back in my little town.
Nothin' but the dead and dyin' back in my little town. I should have known you'd bid me farewell.
There's a lesson to be learned from this
And I learned it very well Now I know you're not
The only starfish in the sea.
If I never hear your name again
It's all the same to me. And I think it's gonna be all right.
Yeah, the worst is over,
Now the morning sun is shining like a Red Rubber Ball. You never cared for secrets I'd confide.
For you I'm just an ornament,
Something for your pride. Always running, never caring,
That's the life you live.
Stolen minutes of your time
Were all you had to give. And I think it's gonna be all right.
Yeah, the worst is over,
Now the morning sun is shining like a Red Rubber Ball. The story's in the past with nothing to recall.
I've got my life to live and I
Don't need you at all.
The roller coaster ride we took is
Nearly at an end.
I bought my ticket with my tears,
That's all I'm gonna spend. And I think it's gonna be all right.
Yeah, the worst is over,
Now the morning sun is shining like a Red Rubber Ball. Time it was, and what a time it was, it was
A time of innocence, A time of confidences
Long ago, it must be, I have a photograph
Preserve your memories; They're all that's left you "The problem is all inside your head", she said to me
The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover She said it's really not my habit to intrude
Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued
But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover Fifty ways to leave your lover
Just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan

She said it grieves me so to see you in such pain
I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again
I said I appreciate that and would you please explain About the fifty ways
She said why don't we both just sleep on it tonight
And I believe in the morning you'll begin to see the light
And then she kissed me and I realized she probably was right There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover
Just slip out the back, Jack

And get yourself free A winter's day
In a deep and dark
December
I am alone
Gazing from my window to the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
I am a rock
I am an island I've built walls
A fortress deep and mighty
That none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship, friendship causes pain
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain
I am a rock
I am an island Don't talk of love
But I've heard the words before
It's sleeping in my memory
I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died
If I never loved I never would have cried
I am a rock
I am an island I have my books
And my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor
Hiding in my room, safe within my womb
I touch no one and no one touches me
I am a rock
I am an island And a rock feels no pain
And an island never cries We share the days of laughter,
We share the nights of sorrow,
And in the morning after,
We face the bright tomorrow.
Side by side we'll always stand
Spirits flying high,
Long as I can hold your hand,
We'll never say goodbye.
We walk the halls of learning
And serve a proud tradition,
The flame of truth is burning,
To clarify our vision.
Look at how the future gleams
Gold against the sky,
Long as I can share your dreams,
We'll never say goodbye.
There's little to be sure of,
But we will last forever,
For now we know the pure love
We feel when we're together.
Then if someday we should part,
We will not say die,
Long as you are in my heart
We'll never say goodbye.
Long as you are in my heart
We'll never say goodbye. Tom, get your plane right on time
I know your part'll go fine
Fly down to Mexico
Do-n-do-d-do-n-do and here I am,
The only living boy in New York I get the news I need on the weather report
I can gather all the news I need on the weather report
Hey, I've got nothing to do today but smile
Do-n-doh-d-doh-n-doh and here I am
The only living boy in New York Half of the time we're gone
But we don't know where,
And we don't know where Half of the time we're gone
But we don't know where,
And we don't know where Tom, get your plane right on time
I know you've been eager to fly now
Hey let your honesty shine, shine, shine now
Do-n-do-d-do-n-do
Like it shines on me
The only living boy in New York,
The only living boy in New York Gee but it's great to be back home
Home is where I want to be.
I've been on the road so long my friend,
And if you came along
I know you couldn't disagree. It's the same old story, yeah
Everywhere I go,
I get slandered, libeled,
I hear words I never heard in the Bible
And I'm one step ahead of the shoe shine
Two steps away from the county line
Just trying to keep my customers satisfied,
Satisfied. Deputy Sheriff said to me
Tell me what you come here for, boy.
You better get your bags and flee.
You're in trouble boy,
And you're heading into more. It's the same old story,
Everywhere I go,
I get slandered, libeled,
I hear words I never heard in the Bible
And I'm one step ahead of the shoe shine
Two steps away from the county line
Just trying to keep my customers satisfied,
Satisfied Woah woah woah woah It's the same old story,
Everywhere I go,
I get slandered, libeled,
I hear words I never heard in the Bible
And I'm so tired, so tired
But I'm trying to keep my customers satisfied,
Satisfied Last night I had the strangest dream
I ever dreamed before
I dreamed the world had all agreed
To put an end to war
I dreamed I saw a mighty room
The room was filled with men
And the paper they were signing said
They'd never fight again And when the papers all were signed
And a million copies made
They all joined hands end bowed their heeds
And grateful prayers were prayed
And the people in the streets below
Were dancing round and round
And guns and swords and uniforms
Were scattered on the ground Last night I had the strangest dream
I ever dreamed before
I dreamed the world had all agreed
To put an end to war Are you going to Scarborough Fair
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine Tell her to make me a cambric shirt (deep forest green)
Parsley sage rosemary and thyme
Without no seams nor needle work (blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain)
Then she'll be a true love of mine (sleeps unaware of the clarion call) Tell her to find me an acre of land (a sprinkling of leaves)
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme (washes the grave with silvery tears)
Between the salt water and the sea strand (A soldier cleans and polishes a gun)
She'll be a true love of mine Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather (War bellows blazing in scarlet battalions)
Parsley sage rosemary and thyme (General order their soldiers to kill)
And gather it all in a bunch of heather (And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten)
Then she'll be a true love of mine Are you going to Scarborough Fair
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine Catch a boat to England, baby,
Maybe to Spain
Wherever I have gone,
Wherever I've been and gone
Wherever I have gone
The blues run the game Send out for whiskey, baby,
Send out for gin
Me and room service, honey
Me and room service, babe
Me and room service, whoa
We're livin' a life of sin When I ain't drinkin', baby
You are on my mind
When I ain't sleepin', honey
When I ain't sleepin', momma
When I ain't sleepin', well
You know you'll find me crying Catch a boat to England, baby,
Maybe to Spain
Wherever I have gone,
Wherever I've been and gone
Wherever I have gone
The blues run the game Livin' is a gamble, baby
Lovin's much the same
Wherever I have played
Wherever I throw those dice
Wherever I have played
The blues run the game Maybe when I'm older, baby
Someplace down the line
I'll wake up older
So much older, momma
Wake up older
And I'll just stop all my tryin' Catch a boat to England, baby,
Maybe to Spain
Wherever I have gone,
Wherever I've been and gone
Wherever I have gone
The blues are all the same Time, time time, see what's become of me
While I looked around for my possibilities I was so hard to please
Don't look around
The leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter Hear the Salvation Army band
Down by the riverside's, there's bound to be a better ride
Than what you've got planned Carry your cup in your hand
And look around
Leaves are brown, now
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter Hang on to your hopes, my friend
That's an easy thing to say
But if your hopes should pass away
Simply pretend that you can build them again
Look around
The grass is high
The fields are ripe
It's the springtime of my life Seasons change with the scenery
Weaving time in a tapestry
Won't you stop and remember me
At any convenient time?
Funny how my memory skips while looking over manuscripts
Of unpublished rhyme
Drinking my vodka and lime
I look around
Leaves are brown, now
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter
Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground
Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground
Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground When I think back on all the crap I've learned in highschool
It's a wonder I can think at all
Though my lack of education hasn't hurt me much
I can read the writings on the walls Kodachrome, they give us those nice bright colors
They give us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the world's a sunny day, oh yeah
I got a Nikon camera, I love to take a photograph
So mama don't take my Kodachrome away If you took all the girls I knew when I was single
Brought 'em all together for one night
I know they'd never match my sweet imagination
Everything looks better in black and white Kodachrome, they give us those nice bright colors
They give us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the world's a sunny day, oh yeah
I got a Nikon camera, I love to take a photograph
So mama don't take my Kodachrome away Mama don't take my Kodachrome away, mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away Mama don't take my Kodachrome, mama don't take my Kodachrome
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome and leave your boy so far from home
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome, whew whew, mama don't take my Kodachrome away Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away I know a man, he came from my home town
He wore his passion for his woman like a thorny crown
He said "Delores, I live in fear
My love for you is so overpowering I'm afraid that I will disappear"
Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination The more you're slip slidin' away
I know a woman, became a wife
These are the very words she uses to describe her life
She said "A good day ain't got not rain" She said "A bad day's when I lie in bed
And I think of things that might have been"
Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away
And I know a father who had a son
He longed to tell him all the reasons for the things he had done He came a long way just to explain
He kissed his boy as he lay sleeping
Then he turned around and he headed home again
Slip slidin' away Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away
God only knows, God makes his plan The information's unavailable to the mortal man
We're working our jobs, collect our pay
Believe we're gliding down the highway
When in fact we're slip slidin' away Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away Original French/French Creole lyrics:
Feuilles oh, sauvez la vie moi, dans mes yeux mouilles oh
Feuilles oh, sauvez la vie moi, dans mes yeux mouilles oh
Pitie moi malade, mon coeur caille gang-gang, si me l'eau
Pitie moi malade, mon coeur caille gang-gang, si lu bon gang-gang
Sauvez la vie moi, dans mes yeux mouilles oh Feuilles oh, sauvez la vie moi, dans mes yeux mouilles oh
Feuilles oh, sauvez la vie moi, dans mes yeux mouilles oh
Pitie moi malade, mon coeur caille gang-gang, si me l'eau.
Pitie moi malade, mon coeur caille gang-gang, si lu bon gang-gang
Sauvez la vie moi, dans mes yeux mouilles oh
Dans mes yeux mouilles oh English translation:
Oh leaves, save my life, in my wet eyes
Oh leaves, save my life, in my wet eyes
Pity sick me, my heart is cold, doctor, like the water
Pity sick me, my heart is cold, doctor, if you read me, good doctor
Save my life, in my wet eyes Oh leaves, save my life, in my wet eyes
Oh leaves, save my life, in my wet eyes
Pity sick me, my heart is cold, doctor, like the water
Pity sick me, my heart is cold, doctor, if you read me, good doctor
Save my life, in my wet eyes
In my wet eyes April come she will
When streams are ripe and swelled with rain
May she will stay
Resting in my arms again
June she'll change her tune
In restless walks she'll prowl the night July she will fly
And give no warning to her flight
August die she must
The autumn winds blow chilly and cold
September I remember
A love once new has now grown old It's a still life watercolor
Of a now-late afternoon
As the sun shines through the curtained lace
And shadows wash the room And we sit and drink our coffee
Couched in our indifference, like shells upon the shore
You can hear the ocean roar In the dangling conversation
And the superficial sighs
The borders of our lives And you read your Emily Dickinson
And I my Robert Frost
And we note our place with book markers
That measure what we've lost Like a poem poorly written
We are verses out of rhythm
Couplets out of rhyme
In syncopated time And the dangled conversation
And the superficial sighs
Are the borders of our lives Yes, we speak of things that matter
With words that must be said
"Can analysis be worthwhile?"
"Is the theater really dead?" And how the room is softly faded
And I only kiss your shadow, I cannot feel your hand
You're a stranger now unto me Lost in the dangling conversation
And the superficial sighs
In the borders of our lives New York, to that tall skyline I come, flyin' in from London to your door
New York, lookin' down on Central Park
Where they say you should not wander after dark New York, like a scene from all those movies
But you're real enough to me, but there's a heart
A heart that lives in New York A heart in New York, a rose on the street
I write my song to that city heartbeat
A heart in New York, love in her eye, an open door and a friend for the night New York, you got money on your mind
And my words won't make a dime's worth a difference, so here's to you New York Fog's rollin' in off the East River bank
Like a shroud it covers Bleeker Street
Fills the alleys where men sleep
Hides the shepherd from the sheep Voices leaking from a sad cafe
Smiling faces try to understand
I saw a shadow touch a shadow's hand
On Bleeker Street A poet reads his crooked rhyme
Holy, holy is his sacrament
Thirty dollars pays your rent
On Bleeker Street I head a church bell softly chime
In a melody sustainin'
It's a long road to Caanan
On Bleeker Street
Bleeker Street I been Norman Mailered, Maxwell Taylored
I been John O'Hara'd, McNamara'd
I been Rolling Stoned and Beatled till I'm blind
I been Ayn Randed, nearly branded
Communist, 'cause I'm left-handed
That's the hand I use, well, never mind I been Phil Spectored, resurrected
I been Lou Adlered, Barry Sadlered
Well, I paid all the dues I want to pay
And I learned the truth from Lenny Bruce
And all my wealth won't buy me health
So I smoke a pint of tea a day I knew a man, his brain was so small
He couldn't think of nothing at all
Not the same as you and me
He doesn't dig poetry
He's so unhip that when you say Dylan
He thinks you're talking about Dylan Thomas
Whoever he was
The man ain't got no culture
But it's alright, ma, everybody must get stoned I been Mick Jaggered and silver daggered
Andy Warhol, won't you please come home?
I been mother, father, aunt and uncled
Been Roy Haleed and Art Garfunkeled
I just discovered somebody's tapped my phone Folk rock
I've lost my harmonica, Albert I can hear the soft breathing
Of the girl that I love,
As she lies here beside me
Asleep with the night,
And her hair, in a fine mist
Floats on my pillow,
Reflecting the glow
Of the winter moonlight.
She is soft, she is warm,
But my heart remains heavy,
And I watch as her breasts
Gently rise, gently fall,
For I know with the first light of dawn
I'll be leaving,
And tonight will be
All I have left to recall.
Oh, what have I done,
Why have I done it,
I've committed a crime,
I've broken the law.
For twenty-five dollars
And pieces of silver,
I held up and robbed
A hard liquor store.
My life seems unreal,
My crime an illusion,
A scene badly written
In which I must play.
Yet I know as I gaze
At my young love beside me,
The morning is just a few hours away. Someone told me it's all happening at the zoo I do believe it
I do believe it's true It's a light and tumble journey
From the East Side to the park
Just a fine and fancy ramble
To the zoo But you can take the crosstown bus
If it's raining or it's cold
And the animals will love it if you do
If you do, now Somethin' tells me it's all happening at the zoo I do believe it
I do believe it's true The monkeys stand for honesty
Giraffes are insincere
And the elephants are kindly but they're dumb
Orangutans are skeptical
Of changes in their cages
And the zookeeper is very fond of rum Zebras are reactionaries
Antelopes are missionaries
Pigeons plot in secrecy
And hamsters turn on frequently
What a gas, you gotta come and see
At the zoo
At the zoo
At the zoo
At the zoo
At the zoo
At the zoo
At the zoo
At the zoo Old friends, old friends,
Sat on their parkbench like bookends
A newspaper blown through the grass
Falls on the round toes
of the high shoes of the old friends Old friends, winter companions, the old men
Lost in their overcoats, waiting for the sun
The sounds of the city sifting through trees
Settles like dust on the shoulders of the old friends Can you imagine us years from today,
Sharing a parkbench quietly
How terribly strange to be seventy Old friends, memory brushes the same years,
Silently sharing the same fears Many's the time I've been mistaken, and many times confused
Yes and I've often felt forsaken, and certainly misused
Ah but I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm just weary through my bones
Still you don't expect to be bright and bon-vivant
So far away from home, so far away from home And I don't know a soul who's not been battered
I don't have a friend who feels at ease
I don't know a dream that's not been shattered or driven to its knees
But it's alright, it's alright, for we live so well, so long
Still, when I think of the road we're traveling on
I wonder what's gone wrong, I can't help it I wonder what's gone wrong And I dreamed I was dying, I dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly
And looking back down at me, smiled reassuringly
And I dreamed I was flying, and high up above my eyes could clearly see
The statue of liberty, sailing away to sea, and I dreamed I was flying But we come on a ship they called Mayflower
We come on a ship that sailed the moon
We come in the ages' most uncertain hours and sing an American tune
And it's alright, oh it's alright, it's alright, you can be forever blessed
Still tomorrow's gonna be another working day and I'm trying to get some rest
That's all I'm trying, to get some rest What a dream I had
Pressed in organdy
Clothed in crinoline of smoky Burgundy
Softer than the rain I wandered empty streets down
Past the shop displays
I heard cathedral bells
Tripping down the alleyways
As I walked on And when you ran to me, your
Cheeks flushed with the night
We walked on frosted fields of juniper and lamplight
I held your hand And when I awoke and felt you warm and near
I kissed your honey hair with my grateful tears
Oh, I love you, girl
Oh, I love you Slow down, you move too fast
You got to make the morning last
Just kicking down the cobblestones
Looking for fun and feeling groovy
Ba da-da da-da da-da, feeling groovy Hello lamppost, what'cha knowing
I've come to watch your flowers growin'
Ain't cha got no rhymes for me?
Doo-ait-n-doo-doo, feeling groovy
Ba da-da da-da da-da, feeling groovy I got no deeds to do, no promises to keep
I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep
Let the morningtime drop all its petals on me
Life, I love you, all is groovy I was twenty-one years when I wrote this song.
I'm twenty-two now but I won't be for long
Time hurries on.
And the leaves that are green turn to brown,
And they wither with the wind,
And they crumble in your hand. Once my heart was filled with the love of a girl.
I held her close, but she faded in the night
Like a poem I meant to write.
And the leaves that are green turn to brown,
And they wither with the wind,
And they crumble in your hand. I threw a pebble in a brook
And watched the ripples run away
And they never made a sound.
And the leaves that are green turned to brown,
And they wither with the wind,
And they crumble in your hand. Hello, Hello, Hello, Good-bye,
Good-bye, Good-bye, Good-bye,
That's all there is.
And the leaves that are green turned to brown,
And they wither with the wind,
And they crumble in your hand. When she goes, she's gone.
If she stays, she stays here.
The girl does what she wants to do.
She knows what she wants to do.
And I know I'm fakin' it,
I'm not really makin' it. I'm such a dubious soul,
And a walk in the garden
Wears me down.
Tangled in the fallen vines,
Pickin' up the punch lines,
I've just been fakin' it,
Not really makin' it. Is there any danger?
No, no, not really.
Just lean on me.
Takin' time to treat
Your friendly neighbors honestly.
I've just been fakin' it,
I'm not really makin' it.
This feeling of fakin' it-
I still haven't shaken it. Prior to this lifetime
I surely was a tailor.
("Good morning, Mr. Leitch.
Have you had a busy day?")
I own the tailor's face and hands
I am the tailor's face and hands and
I know I'm fakin' it,
I'm not really makin' it.
This feeling of fakin' it-
I still haven't shaken it. Cloudy
The sky is gray and white and cloudy,
Sometimes I think it's hanging down on me
And it's a hitchhike a hundred miles
I'm a rag-a-muffin child
Pointed finger-painted smile
I left my shadow waiting down the road for me a while Cloudy
My thoughts are scattered and they're cloudy,
They have no borders, no boundaries
They echo and they swell
From Tolstoy to Tinker Bell
Down from Berkeley to Carmel
Got some pictures in my pocket and a lot of time to kill Hey sunshine
I haven't seen you in a long time
Why don't you show your face and bend my mind?
These clouds stick to the sky
Like floating questions, why?
And they linger there to die
They don't know where they are going, and, my friend, neither do I Cloudy
Cloudy
Cloudy
Cloudy Why don't you write me
I'm out in the jungle
I'm hungry to hear you. Send me a card,
I am waiting so hard
To be near you. (La, la, la)
Why don't you write? Something is wrong
And I know I got to be there.
Maybe I'm lost,
But I can't make the cost
Of the airfare, ooh Tell me why (Why)
Tell me why (Why) Why don't you write me,
A letter would brighten
My loneliest evening. Mail it today
If it's only to say
That you're leaving me.
(La, la, la) Monday morning, sitting in the sun
Hoping and wishing for the mail to come.
Tuesday, never got a word,
Hm
Wednesday, Thursday, ain't no sign,
Drank a half a bottle of iodine.
Friday, woe is me
Gonna hang my body from the highest tree.
Why don't you write me?
Why don't you write me?
Why don't you write me?
Why don't you write me?
Why don't you write me?
Why don't you write me?
Why don't you write me? Mama pajama rolled out of bed, she ran to the police station
When the cop found out, he began to shout, he started the investigation
And it's against the law, it was against the law
What what mama saw, it was against the law Mama looked down and spit on the ground ever time her name gets mentioned
The cop said oy, if I get that boy
I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention
Well I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm going
I'm on my way, taking my time, but I don't know where Goodbye to Rosie, the queen of Corona
Seeing me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Seeing me and Julio down by the schoolyard In a couple of days they're gonna take me away
When the press let the story leak
Now when the radical breach comes to get me released
Appears all on the cover of Newsweek
And I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm going
But I'm on my way, taking my time, but I don't know where Goodbye to Rosie, the queen of Corona
Seeing me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Seeing me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Seeing me and Julio down by the schoolyard [Instrumental] Slip slidin' away

The teacher's lookin' over
So I got to whisper way down low
To say, "Who-bop-a-loo-chi-bop, let's meet
After school at three." She said, "Hey, babe, but there is one thing more
My school is over at half past four
Maybe when we're older then we can date
O - oh, let's wait!"
Hey, Schoolgirl in the second row
The teacher's lookin' over
So I got to whisper way down low
To say, "Who-bop-a-loo-chi-bop, let's meet
After school at three." She said, "Hey, babe, I gotta lot to do,
It takes me hours till my homework's through,
Someday we'll go steady, so don't you fret.
O - oh, not yet!"
Hey, Schoolgirl in the second row
The teacher's lookin' over
So I got to whisper way down low
To say, "Who-bop-a-loo-chi-bop, let's meet
After school at three." Then she turned around to me
With that gleam in her eye
She said, "I'm sorry if I passed you by,
I'm gonna skip my homework
Gonna cut my class,
Bug out of here real fast." Hey, Schoolgirl in the second row
Now we're going steady,
Hear the words that I want you to know
Well it's "Who-bop-a-loo-chi-bop, you're mine,
I knew it all the time."
Who-bop-a-loo-chi-bop, hah, you're mine God rest ye merry gentlemen,
Let nothing you dismay. Remember Christ our savior,
Was born on Christmas Day. To save us all from Satan's power,
When we we're gone astray. Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy,
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy. God rest ye merry gentlemen,
Let nothing you dismay. Remember Christ our savior,
Was born on Christmas Day. To save us all from Satan's power,
When we we're gone astray. Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy,
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy. The first thing I remember, I was lying in my bed
I couldn't 'ave been no more than one or two
And I remember there's a radio, coming from the room next door
My mother laughed away some ladies' due Well it's late in the evening, and all the music sees me through The next thing I remember, I am walking down a street
I'm feeling alright with my boys and with my troops, yeah
Down along the avenue some guys are shootin' pool
And I heard the sound of acapella groups, yeah Singin' late in the evening, and all the girls out on the stoops, yeah Then I remember playin' some lead guitar, I was underage in this funky bar
And I stepped outside to smoke myself a J
When I come back to the room, everybody just seemed to move
And I turned my amp up louder to get away It was late in the evening, and I blew that room away First thing I remember when you came into my life
I said I want to get that girl, no matter what I do
Well I guess I've been in love before and once or twice have been on the floor
But I've never loved no-one the way that I love you And it was late in the evening, and all the music sees me through First thing I remember when you came into my life
I said I want to get that girl, no matter what I do
Well I guess I've been in love before and once or twice have been on the floor
But I've never loved no-one the way that I love you And it was late in the evening, and all the music sees me through Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit.
Blessed is the lamb whose blood flows.
Blessed are the sat upon, Spat upon, Ratted on,
O Lord, Why have you forsaken me?
I got no place to go,
I've walked around Soho for the last night or so.
Ah, but it doesn't matter, no. Blessed is the land and the kingdom.
Blessed is the man whose soul belongs to.
Blessed are the meth drinkers, Pot sellers, Illusion dwellers.
O Lord, Why have you forsaken me?
My words trickle down, like a wound
That I have no intention to heal. Blessed are the stained glass, window pane glass.
Blessed is the church service makes me nervous
Blessed are the penny rookers, Cheap hookers, Groovy lookers.
O Lord, Why have you forsaken me?
I have tended my own garden
Much too long. He was my brother
Five years older than I
He was my brother
Twenty-three years old the day he died Freedom writer
They cursed my brother to his face
Go home outsider
This town's gonna be your buryin' place He was singin' on his knees
An angry mob trailed along
They shot my brother dead
Because he hated what was wrong He was my brother
Tears can't bring him back to me
He was my brother
And he died so his brothers could be free
He died so his brothers could be free The sun is burning in the sky
Strands of clouds go slowly drifting by
In the park the lazy breeze
Are joining in the flowers, among the trees
And the sun burns in the sky Now the sun is in the West
Little kids go home to take their rest
And the couples in the park
Are holdin' hands and waitin' for the dark
And the sun is in the West Now the sun is sinking low
Children playin' know it's time to go
High above a spot appears
A little blossom blooms and then draws near
And the sun is sinking low Now the sun has come to Earth
Shrouded in a mushroom cloud of death
Death comes in a blinding flash
Of hellish heat and leaves a smear of ash
And the sun has come to Earth Now the sun has disappeared
All is darkness, anger, pain and fear
Twisted, sightless wrecks of men
Go groping on their knees and cry in pain
And the sun has disappeared They say that Richard Cory owns one half of this whole town,
With political connections to spread his wealth around.
Born into society, a banker's only child,
He had everything a man could want: power, grace, and style. But I work in his factory
And I curse the life I'm living
And I curse my poverty
And I wish that I could be,
Oh, I wish that I could be,
Oh, I wish that I could be
Richard Cory. The papers print his picture almost everywhere he goes:
Richard Cory at the opera, Richard Cory at a show.
And the rumor of his parties and the orgies on his yacht!
Oh, he surely must be happy with everything he's got. But I work in his factory
And I curse the life I'm living
And I curse my poverty
And I wish that I could be,
Oh, I wish that I could be,
Oh, I wish that I could be
Richard Cory. He freely gave to charity, he had the common touch,
And they were grateful for his patronage and thanked him very much,
So my mind was filled with wonder when the evening headlines read:
"Richard Cory went home last night and put a bullet through his head." But I work in his factory
And I curse the life I'm living
And I curse my poverty
And I wish that I could be,
Oh, I wish that I could be,
Oh, I wish that I could be
Richard Cory. "Good God! Don't jump!"
A boy sat on the ledge.
An old man who had fainted was revived.
And everyone agreed it would be a miracle indeed
If the boy survived. "Save the life of my child!"
Cried the desperate mother. The woman from the supermarket
Ran to call the cops.
"He must be high on something," someone said.
Though it never made The New York Times.
In The Daily News, the caption read,
"Save the life of my child!"
Cried the desperate mother. A patrol car passing by
Halted to a stop.
Said officer MacDougal in dismay:
"The force can't do a decent job
'Cause the kids got no respect
For the law today (and blah blah blah)." "Save the life of my child!"
Cried the desperate mother.
"What's becoming of the children?"
People asking each other. When darkness fell, excitement kissed the crowd
And made them wild
In an atmosphere of freaky holiday.
When the spotlight hit the boy,
The crowd began to cheer,
He flew away. "Oh, my Grace, I got no hiding place." Do people have a tendency to dump on you?

He says why am I soft in the middle now
Why am I soft in the middle
The rest of my life is so hard
I need a photo-opportunity
I want a shot at redemption
Don't want to end up a cartoon
In a cartoon graveyard
Bonedigger Bonedigger
Dogs in the moonlight
Far away my well-lit door
Mr. Beerbelly Beerbelly
Get these mutts away from me
You know I don't find this stuff amusing anymore If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty when you call me
You can call me Al A man walks down the street
He says why am I short of attention
Got a short little span of attention
And wo my nights are so long
Where's my wife and family
What if I die here
Who'll be my role-model
Now that my role-model is
Gone Gone
He ducked back down the alley
With some roly-poly little bat-faced girl
All along along
There were incidents and accidents
There were hints and allegations If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty when you call me
You can call me Al
Call me Al A man walks down the street
It's a street in a strange world
Maybe it's the Third World
Maybe it's his first time around
He doesn't speak the language
He holds no currency
He is a foreign man
He is surrounded by the sound
The sound
Cattle in the marketplace
Scatterlings and orphanages
He looks around, around
He sees angels in the architecture
Spinning in infinity
He says Amen! and Hallelujah! If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty when you call me
You can call me Al
Call me Al So long, Frank Lloyd Wright.
I can't believe your song is gone so soon.
I barely learned the tune
So soon
So soon. I'll remember Frank Lloyd Wright.
All of the nights we'd harmonize till dawn.
I never laughed so long
So long
So long. Architects may come and
Architects may go and
Never change your point of view.
When I run dry
I stop awhile and think of you Architects may come and
Architects may go and
Never change your point of view. So long, Frank Lloyd Wright
All of the nights we'd harmonize till dawn.
I never laughed so long
So long
So long. So long
So long. So long
So long. So long
So long. Someone told me it's all happening at the zoo I do believe it
I do believe it's true It's a light and tumble journey
From the East Side to the park
Just a fine and fancy ramble
To the zoo But you can take the crosstown bus
If it's raining or it's cold
And the animals will love it if you do
If you do, now Somethin' tells me it's all happening at the zoo I do believe it
I do believe it's true The monkeys stand for honesty
Giraffes are insincere
And the elephants are kindly but they're dumb
Orangutans are skeptical
Of changes in their cages
And the zookeeper is very fond of rum Zebras are reactionaries
Antelopes are missionaries
Pigeons plot in secrecy
And hamsters turn on frequently
What a gas, you gotta come and see
At the zoo
At the zoo
At the zoo
At the zoo
At the zoo
At the zoo
At the zoo
At the zoo When the last eagle flies
Over the last crumbling mountain
And the last lion roars
At the last dusty fountain
In the shadow of the forest
Though she may be old and worn
They will stare unbelieving
At the Last Unicorn
When the first breath of winter
Throught the flowers is icing
And you look to the north
And a pale moon is rising
And it seems like all is dying
And would leave the world to mourn
In the distance hear her laughter
It's the Last Unicorn
I'm alive....... I'm alive
When the last moon is cast
Over the last star of morning
And the future has past
Without even a last desparate warning
Then look into the sky where through
The cloudes a path is formed
Look and see her how she sparkles
It's the Last Unicorn
I'm alive... I'm alive. If you want to write a song about the moon
Walk along the craters in the afternoon
When the shadows are deep and the light is alien
And gravity leaps like a knife off the pavement
And you want to write a song about the moon
You want to write a spiritual tune
Na na na na na na
Yeah yeah yeah
Presto, a song about the moon If you want to write a song about the heart
Think about the moon before you start
Cause the heart will howl like a dog in the moonlight
And the heart can explode like a pistol on a June night
So if you want to write a song about the heart
And its ever-longing for a counterpart
Na na na na na na
Yeah yeah yeah
Write a song about the moon Laughing boy laughed so hard
He fell down from his place
Laughing girl she laughed so hard
Tears rolled down her face
Wo wo
Don't look at her If you want to write a song about a face
That you really can't remember but you can't erase
Oh wo
Wash your hands and dreams and dreams and lightning
Cut off your hair and whatever is frightening
If you want to write a song about a face
If you want to write a song about the human race
Na na na na na na
Yeah yeah yeah
Write a song about the moon Oh oh oh oh oh oooo You want to write a song about the moon
If you want to write a spiritual tune
Na na na na na na
Yeah yeah yeah
Then do it!
Write a song about the moon A child arrived just the other day,
He came to the world in the usual way.
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay.
He learned to walk while I was away.
And he was talking before I knew it, and as he grew,
He'd say, "I'm gonna be like you, dad.
You know I'm gonna be like you." And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
"When you coming home, dad?" "I don't know when,
But we'll get together then son.
You know we'll have a good time then." My son turned ten just the other day.
He said, "Thanks for the ball, dad, come on let's play.
Can you teach me to throw?" I said, "Not today,
I got a lot to do." He said, "That's ok."
And he walked away, but his smile never dimmed,
Said, "I'm gonna be like him, yeah.
You know I'm gonna be like him." And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
"When you coming home, dad?" "I don't know when,
But we'll get together then son.
You know we'll have a good time then." Well, he came from college just the other day,
So much like a man I just had to say,
"Son, I'm proud of you. Can you sit for a while?"
He shook his head, and he said with a smile,
"What I'd really like, dad, is to borrow the car keys.
See you later. Can I have them please?" And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
"When you coming home, son?" "I don't know when,
But we'll get together then, dad.
You know we'll have a good time then." I've long since retired and my son's moved away.
I called him up just the other day.
I said, "I'd like to see you if you don't mind."
He said, "I'd love to, dad, if I could find the time.
You see, my new job's a hassle, and the kid's got the flu,
But it's sure nice talking to you, dad.
It's been sure nice talking to you."
And as I hung up the phone, it occurred to me,
He'd grown up just like me.
My boy was just like me. And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
"When you coming home, son?" "I don't know when,
But we'll get together then, dad.
We're gonna have a good time then." Who will love a little Sparrow?
Who's traveled far and cries for rest?
"Not I," said the Oak Tree,
"I won't share my branches with
No sparrow's nest,
And my blanket of leaves won't warm
Her cold breast." Who will love a little Sparrow
And who will speak a kindly word?
"Not I," said the Swan,
"The entire idea is utterly absurd,
I'd be laughed at and scorned if the
Other Swans heard." Who will take pity in his heart,
And who will feed a starving sparrow?
"Not I," said the Golden Wheat,
"I would if I could but I cannot I know,
I need all my grain to prosper and grow." Who will love a little Sparrow?
Will no one write her eulogy?
"I will," said the Earth,
"For all I've created returns unto me,
From dust were ye made and dust ye shall be." Wish I was a Kellogg's Cornflake
Floatin' in my bowl takin' movies,
Relaxin' awhile, livin' in style,
Talkin' to a raisin who 'caisson'ly plays L.A.,
Casually glancing at his toupee. Wish I was an English muffin
'Bout to make the most out of a toaster. I'd ease myself down,
Comin' up brown. I prefer boysenberry
More than any ordinary jam.
I'm a "Citizens for Boysenberry Jam" fan. Ah, South California. If I become a first lieutenant
Would you put my photo on your piano?
To Maryjane
Best wishes, Martin.
(Old Roger draft-dodger
Leavin' by the basement door),
Everybody knows what he's
Tippy-toeing down there for Through the corridors of sleep
Past shadows dark and deep
My mind dances and leaps in confusion
I don't know what is real
I can't touch what I feel
And I hide behind the shield of my illusion So I'll continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end
And flowers never bend
With the rainfall The mirror on my wall
Casts an image dark and small
But I'm not sure at all it's my reflection
I am blinded by the light
Of God and truth and right
And I wander in the night without direction So I'll continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end
And flowers never bend
With the rainfall No matter if you're born
To play the King or pawn
For the line is thinly drawn 'tween joy and sorrow
So my fantasy
Becomes reality
And I must be what I must be and face tomorrow So I'll continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end
And flowers never bend
With the rainfall As we marched down to Faneri-o
As we marched down to Faneri-o
Our captain fell n love with a lady like a dove
And they called her name, pretty Peggy-o
Come a runnin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-o
Come a runnin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-o
Come a runnin' down the stairs, combin' back
Your yellow hair
You're the prettiest little girl I've ever seen-o In a carriage you will ride, pretty Peggy-o
In a carriage you will ride, pretty Peggy-o
In a carriage you will ride, with your true love by
Your side
As far as any maiden in the are-e-o
What will your mother say, pretry Peggy-o?
What will your mother say, pretty Peggy-o?
What will your mother say, when she finds you've
Gone away
To places far and strange to Faneri-o? If ever I return, pretty Peggy-o
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-o
If ever I return, all your cities I will burn
Destroying all the ladies in the are-e-o
Destroying all the ladies in the are-e-o He was a most peculiar man.
That's what Mrs. Riordan said and she should know;
She lived upstairs from him
She said he was a most peculiar man. He was a most peculiar man.
He lived all alone within a house,
Within a room, within himself,
A most peculiar man. He had no friends, he seldom spoke
And no one in turn ever spoke to him,
'Cause he wasn't friendly and he didn't care
And he wasn't like them.
Oh, no! he was a most peculiar man. He died last Saturday.
He turned on the gas and he went to sleep
With the windows closed so he'd never wake up
To his silent world and his tiny room; And Mrs. Riordan says he has a brother somewhere
Who should be notified soon.
And all the people said, "What a shame that he's dead,
But wasn't he a most peculiar man?" The last train is nearly due
The underground is closing soon
And in the dark deserted station
Restless in anticipation
A man waits in the shadows His restless eyes leap and scratch
At all that they can touch or catch
And hidden deep within his pocket
Safe within its silent socket
He holds a colored crayon Now from the tunnel's stony womb
The carriage rides to meet the groom
And opens wide and welcome doors
But he hesitates, then withdraws
Deeper in the shadows And the train is gone suddenly
On wheels clicking silently
Like a gently tapping litany
And he holds his crayon rosary
Tighter in his hand Now from his pocket quick he flashes
The crayon on the wall he slashes
Deep upon the advertising
A single-worded poem comprised of four letters And his heart is laughing, screaming, pounding
The poem across the tracks rebounding
Shadowed by the exit light
His legs take their ascending flight
To seek the breast of darkness and be suckled by the night, ooh She looked me over
And I guess she thought
I was all right
All right in a sort of a limited way
For an off-night
She said don't I know you
From the cinematographer's party
I said who am I
To blow against the wind
I know what I know
I'll sing what I said
We come and we go
That's a thing that I keep
In the back of my head She said there's something about you
That really reminds me of money
She is the kind of a girl
Who could say things that
Weren't that funny
I said what does that mean
I really remind you of money
She said who am I
To blow against the wind I know what I know
I'll sing what I said
We come and we go
That's a thing that I keep
In the back of my head She moved so easily
All I could think of was sunlight
I said aren't you the women
Who was recently given a Fulbright
She said don't I know you
From the cinematographer's party
I said who am I
To blow against the wind I know what I know
I'll sing what I said
We come and we go
That's a thing that I keep
In the back of my head Well you can tell the world about this
You can tell the nation about that
Tell 'em what the master has done
Tell 'em that the gospel has come
Tell 'em that the victory's been won
He brought joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy,
Into my heart Well my Lord spoke, he spoke so well
Yes he did, yes he did
Talked about the flames that burn in hell
Yes he did, yes he did
Now my Lord spoke, he spoke so well
Yes he did, yes he did
Talked about the children of Israel
Yes he did, yes he did
He brought joy,joy,joy into my heart Well you can tell the world about this
You can tell the nation about that
Tell 'em what the master has done
Tell 'em that the gospel has come
Tell 'em that the victory's been won
He brought joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy,
Into my heart Well my Lord spoke, he spoke to me
Yes he did, yes he did
Talkin' about a man from Galilee
Yes he did, yes he did
My Lord spoke, he spoke to me
Yes he did, yes he did
Talkin' about a man from Galilee
Yes he did, yes he did
He brought joy, joy, joy into my heart Well you can tell the world about this
You can tell the nation about that
Tell 'em what the master has done
Tell 'em that the gospel has come
Tell 'em that the victory's been won
He brought joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy,
Into my heart Well I don't know but I've been told
Yes he did, yes he did
Streets of heaven are paved with gold
Yes he did, yes he did
Now the Jordan River is chilly and wide
Yes he did, yes he did
I got a home on the other side
Yes he did, yes he did
He brought joy, joy, joy into my heart Well you can tell the world about this
You can tell the nation about that
Tell 'em what the master has done
Tell 'em that the gospel has come
Tell 'em that the victory's been won
He brought joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy,
Into my heart "The problem is all inside your head", she said to me
The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover She said it's really not my habit to intrude
Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued
But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover Fifty ways to leave your lover
Just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan

Just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy Just get yourself free
Hop on the bus, Gus

She said it grieves me so to see you in such pain
I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again
I said I appreciate that and would you please explain About the fifty ways
She said why don't we both just sleep on it tonight
And I believe in the morning you'll begin to see the light
And then she kissed me and I realized she probably was right There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover
Just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free

Hallelujah!
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
Jesus Christ is born Down the lonely manger
The humble Christ was born
And God sent salvation
That blessed Christmas morn [Chorus] While shepherds kept their watch
O'er silent flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens
There shown a holy light [Chorus] Down the lonely manger
The humble Christ was born
And God sent salvation
That blessed Christmas morn [Chorus]

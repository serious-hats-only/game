But all I know, is all I know

Or the disco infiltrator will leave
Oh stupid me, oh stupid me
But still we want it oww Stop, we cant shake the waist

Stop, you make me frown your little town
You run the disco infiltrator on down
Oh stupid you, oh stupid me
And we deserve it oww
Stop, you can shake the waist
Stop, you've got to shake the waist Bear in mind, we all fall behind, from time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind, from time to time But all I know, is all I know

Bear in mind, we all fall behind, from time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind, from time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind, from time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind, from time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind, from time to time That's how it starts.
We go back to your house.
We check the charts
And start to figure it out. And if it's crowded, all the better
because we know we're gonna be up late.
But if you're worried about the weather
then you picked the wrong place to stay.
That's how it starts. And so it starts.
You switch the engine on.
We set controls for the heart of the sun
one of the ways we show our age. And if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up
and I still don't wanna stagger home.
Then it's the memory of our betters
that are keeping us on our feet. You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan
and the next five years trying to be with your friends again. You're talking 45 turns just as fast as you can
yeah, I know it gets tired, but it's better when we pretend. It comes apart
the way it does in bad films.
Except in parts
when the moral kicks in. Though when we're running out of the drugs
and the conversation's winding away.
I wouldn't trade one stupid decision
for another five years of life. You drop the first ten years just as fast as you can
and the next ten people who are trying to be polite.
When you're blowing eighty-five days in the middle of France
Yeah, I know it gets tired only where are your friends tonight? And to tell the truth.
Oh, this could be the last time.
So here we go
like a sail's force into the night And if I made a fool, if I made a fool, if I made a fool
on the road, there's always this.
And if I'm sewn into submission
I can still come home to this. And with a face like a dad and a laughable stand
you can sleep on the plane or review what you said.
When you're drunk and the kids leave impossible tasks
you think over and over, "hey, I'm finally dead."
Oh, if the trip and the plan come apart in your hand
you look contorted on yourself your ridiculous prop.
You forgot what you meant when you read what you said
and you always knew you were tired, but then
where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight New York, I Love You
But you're bringing me down New York, I Love You
But you're bringing me down Like a rat in a cage
Pulling minimum wage New York, I Love You
But you're bringing me down New York, you're safer
And you're wasting my time Our records all show
You are filthy but fine But they shuttered your stores
When you opened the doors
To the cops who were bored
Once they'd run out of crime New York, you're perfect
Don't please don't change a thing Your mild billionaire mayor's
Now convinced he's a king So the boring collect
I mean all disrespect In the neighborhood bars
I'd once dreamt I would drink New York, I Love You
But you're freaking me out There's a ton of the twist
But we're fresh out of shout Like a death in the hall
That you hear through your wall New York, I Love You
But you're freaking me out New York, I Love You
But you're bringing me down New York, I Love You
But you're bringing me down Like a death of the heart
Jesus, where do I start? But you're still the one pool
Where I'd happily drown And oh. Take me off your mailing list
For kids that think it still exists
Yes, for those who think it still exists
Maybe I'm wrong
And maybe you're right
Maybe I'm wrong
And myabe you're right
Maybe you're right
Maybe I'm wrong
And just maybe you're right
And Oh.
Maybe mother told you true
And they're always be something there for you
And you'll never be alone
But maybe she's wrong
And maybe I'm right
And just maybe she's wrong
Maybe she's wrong
And maybe I'm right
And if so, is there? Walking up to me, expecting, walking up to me expecting words It happens all the time
Present company excepted, present company, except the worst It happens every night
Ah-ahh
Present company, excluded every time Ah-ahh
Present company, the best that you can find Talking like a jerk, except you are an actual jerk and living proof That sometimes friends are mean
Present company, expect it, present company just laugh it off It's better than it seems
Ah-ahh
Present company, excluded in every way
Ah-ahh
Present company, makes me wanna stay (go) Killing it with close inspection, killing it can only make it worse It sort of makes it breed
Present company accepting, presently we all expect the worst It works just like a need
Ah-ahh
Present company, excluded in the night Ah-ahh
Present company, included in the fight Ah-ahh, ah-ahh, ahh, ah-ahh Don't you want me to wake up?
Then give me just a bit of your time
Arguments are made for make-ups So give it just a little more time
We've got to bring the resources I wanna play until the time comes
Forget your string of divorces Just go and throw your little hands up It's late, oh
I miss the way the night goes With friends who always make it feel good
This basement has a cold glow Though it's better than a bunch of others
So go and dance yourself clean Go and dance yourself clean, yeah
You're blowing marxism to pieces
Their little arguments to pieces,
Show. It's your show It's your show, it's your show It's your show Put your little feet down And hang out Every night's a different story
It's a thirty car pileup with you
Everybody's getting younger
It's the end of an era -- it's true
And you go
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop
Break me into bigger pieces
So some of me is home with you
Wait until the weekend
And we can make our bad dreams come true
And it's a go, yeah, it's a go
And if we wait until the weekend
We could miss the best thing to do
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Go and dance yourself clean
Oh
Gotta dance yourself clean, yeah
And blow the marxists into pieces
Their little arguments to pieces, oh
Wish you'd try a little harder
In the tedious march of the few
Every day's a different warning
There's a part of me hoping it's true Yeah, I'm losing my edge.
I'm losing my edge.
The kids are coming up from behind.
I'm losing my edge.
I'm losing my edge to the kids from France and from London.
But I was there. I was there in 1968. 
I was there at the first Can show in Cologne.
I'm losing my edge.
I'm losing my edge to the kids whose footsteps I hear when they get on the decks.
I'm losing my edge to the Internet seekers who can tell me every member of every good group from 1962 to 1978.
I'm losing my edge. To all the kids in Tokyo and Berlin.
I'm losing my edge to the art-school Brooklynites in little jackets and borrowed nostalgia for the unremembered eighties. But I'm losing my edge.
I'm losing my edge, but I was there.
I was there.
But I was there. I'm losing my edge.
I'm losing my edge.
I can hear the footsteps every night on the decks.
But I was there.
I was there in 1974 at the first Suicide practices in a loft in New York City.
I was working on the organ sounds with much patience.
I was there when Captain Beefheart started up his first band.
I told him, "Don't do it that way. You'll never make a dime."
I was there.
I was the first guy playing Daft Punk to the rock kids.
I played it at CBGB's.
Everybody thought I was crazy.
We all know.
I was there.
I was there.
I've never been wrong. I used to work in the record store. 
I had everything before anyone.
I was there in the Paradise Garage DJ booth with Larry Levan.
I was there in Jamaica during the great sound clashes.
I woke up naked on the beach in Ibiza in 1988. But I'm losing my edge to better-looking people with better ideas and more talent.
And they're actually really, really nice. I'm losing my edge. I heard you have a compilation of every good song ever done by anybody. Every great song by the Beach Boys. All the underground hits. All the Modern Lovers tracks. I heard you have a vinyl of every Niagra record on German import. I heard that you have a white label of every seminal Detroit techno hit - 1985, '86, '87. I heard that you have a CD compilation of every good '60s cut and another box set from the '70s. I hear you're buying a synthesizer and an arpeggiator and are throwing your computer out the window because you want to make something real. You want to make a Yaz record. I hear that you and your band have sold your guitars and bought turntables. 
I hear that you and your band have sold your turntables and bought guitars. I hear everybody that you know is more relevant than everybody that I know. But have you seen my records? This Heat, Pere Ubu, Outsiders, Nation of Ulysses, Mars, The Trojans, The Black Dice, Todd Terry, the Germs, Section 25, Althea and Donna, Sexual Harrassment, a-ha, Pere Ubu, Dorothy Ashby, PIL, the Fania All-Stars, the Bar-Kays, the Human League, the Normal, Lou Reed, Scott Walker, Monks, Niagra, Joy Division, Lower 48, the Association, Sun Ra,

I wish that we could talk about it
But there, that's the problem
With someone new I couldn't start it Too late for beginnings
The little things that made me nervous
Are gone in a moment
I miss the way that we used to argue Locked in the basement
...
I wake up and the phone is ringing
Surprised as it's early And that should be a perfect warning
That something's a problem
To tell the truth I saw you comming
The way you were breathing But nothing can prepare you for it
The voice on the other end
...
The worst is all the lovely weather
I'm stunned it's not raining
The coffee isn't even bitter
Because, what's the difference
There's all the work than needs to be done It's late for revision
There's all the time and all the planning
And songs to be finished
And it keeps coming, and it keeps coming, and it keeps coming 'til the day it stops
And it keeps coming, and it keeps coming, and it keeps coming
'til the day stops
And it keeps coming, and it keeps coming, and it keeps coming, and it keeps coming, and it keeps coming, and it keeps coming, and it keeps coming 'til the day stops
I wish that we could talk about it But there, that's the problem
With someone new I couldn't start it
Too late for beginnings
You're smaller than my wife imagined Surpirsed you were human
There shouldn't be this radio silence
But what are the options
When someone great is gone, when someone great is gone, when someone great is gone, when someone great is gone
When someone great is gone, when someone great is gone, when someone great is gone, when someone great is gone
We're saved
For the moment
Saved
For the moment Tell me a line
Make it easy for me
Open your arms
Dance with me until I feel alright It's good in the dark
Good in the dark
But into the lover's light
Here comes another fight So ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Bar me and hold me and cling to my arm
Here it comes, here it comes And what you're asking me now
Disastrous now
Hoping and hoping, and hoping
The feeling goes away Never change, never change
Never change, never change
Never change, never change
Never change, this is why I fell in love, oh Never change, never change
Never change, never change
Never change, never change
Never change, that's just too up there in love with Oh, this is the time
The very best time
So give me a line and take me home
Take me over But dashing the hopes
Dashing the hopes
And smashing the pride
The morning's got you on the ropes, oh And love is a murderer
Love is a murderer
But if she calls you tonight
Everything is alright, yeah, we know And love is a curse
Shout in a hearse
Love is an open book
To a of your bad poetry
And this is coming from me But I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change
I can change if it helps you fall in love, in love I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change
I can change if it helps you fall in love, in love Turn on the light
Make it easy for me
Fill the divide
Fumble in the kitchen 'til it's right
What an awful sight But there's love in your eyes
Love in your eyes, love in your eyes
But maybe that's just your lover finds
All night And I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change
I can change if it helps you fall in love, in love And I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change
I can change if it helps you fall in love, in love And I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change
I can change if it helps you fall in love, in love And I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change
I can change if it helps you fall in love, in love Daft punk is playing at my house, my house
I'll show you the ropes kid, show you the ropes
Got a bus and a trailer at my house, my house
I'll show you the ropes kid, show you the ropes
I bought fifteen cases for my house, my house
All the furniture is in the garage
Well daft punk is playing at my house, my house
You got to set them up kid, set them up You got to set 'em up, oh oh yeah
You got to set 'em up, oh oh yeah
You got to set them up, set them up Well everybody's lined up in my house, my house
And Sarah's girlfriend is working the door
Got everybody's PA in my house, my house
All the robots descend from the bus
There's a freak out brewing in my house, my house
You got to set them up kid, set them up And never, never let them go
No never, never, never let them go
Never, never, never let them go
Let them go
Downtown Home, home, home
Home, home, home
Take me home Just do it right
Make it perfect and real
Because it's everything
Though everything was never the deal So grab your things
And stumble into the night
So we can shut the door
And shut the door on terrible times, oh Yeah, do it right
And head again into space
So you can carry on and carry on
And fall all over the place This is the trick
Forget a terrible year
That we can break the laws
Until it gets weird And this is what you waited for
But under lights we're all unsure
And so tell me
What would make you feel better? As night has such a local ring
And love and rock are pickup things
And you know it, yeah, you know it
Yeah, you know, take Forget your past, this is your last chance now
And we can break the rules like nothing will last
You might forget, forget the sound of a voice
Still you should not forget, yeah, don't forget
The things that we laughed about And after rolling on the floor
And thankfully a few make sure
That you get home
And you stay home, and you better 'Cause you're afraid of what you need
Yeah, you're afraid of what you need
If you weren't, if you were
I don't know what we'd talk about Yeah, no one ever knows what you're talking about
So I guess you're already there
And no one opens up when you scream and shout
But it's time to make a couple things clear If you're afraid of what you need
If you're afraid of what you need
Look around you, you're surrounded
It won't get any better until the night You couldn't make our wedding day
Too sick to travel
You fell between a friend
And a father I owe you dinner, man
I owe you something
You talk to me
Like I was inside
We were just waking up
For a hard
Interrupt I meant to get to you
On the turning
Things sneak up on me
Like a landslide comes Been saving email trails
Kept together
I read them back sometimes
To remember
The time I wrote to you
From the island
Your quick replies
Made me hide
That I had fear in the room
So I stopped turning up
My hands kept pushing down
In my pockets
I'm bad with people things
But I should have tried more Been watching images
From the station
Earth one from satellites
All streaming
Feels slow at seventeen thousand miles an hour
You could be anywhere
On the black screen
On the black screen
On the black screen
On the black screen
On the black screen You could be anywhere
On the black screen Wait for the day you come home from the lonely part
And look for the girl who has put up with all of your shit
You never have needed anyone for so long You learn in your bed you've been gone for too long
So you put in the time, but it's too late to make it strong Now all I want is your pity
Or all I want are your bitter tears
Yeah, all I want is your pity
Or at least all I want are your bitter tears All I want is your pity
Oh all I want are your bitter tears
Yeah, all I want is your pity
Oh all I want are your bitter tears Wake with a start
And the dog and the girl are gone
So you pack up your things
And head into the lame unknown
You never had needed anyone for so long And now all I want is your pity
And all I want are your bitter tears
Now all I want is your pity
And all I want are your bitter tears From now on, I'm someone different
Cuz it's no fun to be predictably lame
From now on, let's do it different
Cuz I just want what I want Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home From this position
I will relax
From this position
I can see the whole place From this position
Oh, just relax
From this position
I make some stand
I make my peace with the man And it goes pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
It goes pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow From this position
I can see both of them
From this position
I totally get how the decision was reached From this position
I can say "serious" or "cop-out" or "hard to define"
From this position, from this position
It's kind of like eating myself to death You on the outside
Me on the inside
There's advantage to both And me being uptight
And you being all right
There's advantages to each From this perspective, from this position
I have a good grip on both of them
Because I have stayed home and have learned a little more about my neighbourhood, which is important
You know, there's a lot of good places to eat So it goes pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow So it's pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
It goes pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow With you on the keystroke
And me in the gang blank
There's advantages to both And you have been all right
And I have been filmed being ridiculous
Oh, eat it, Michael Musto
You're no Bruce Valance I have been untied
And you are all cross-eyed
There's advantages to each And I'm coming back, coming back, coming back
Until there's nothing left in the well
Is that what they call it, the well? I'm paralyzed and looking through you
But if nothing's right, we try anyway As we compromised an arrogant person
I'm amazed at my decision to blame On this occasion, there are a couple of things that we know that we learned from fact magazine
One, the king wears a king hat and lives in a king house
Two, your time will come, but tonight is our night, so you should give us all of your drugs
Three, we have a black president and you do not, so shut up,
because you don't know shit about where I'm from that you didn't get from your TV So times have been tough, and times have been tough
You have been put down, washed up, erased out
But honestly, and be honest with yourself, how much time do you waste?
How much time do you blow every day? So pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
Oh, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow So pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow The return of the police With you on the inside
Me on the outside
There's advantages to both With me being wired
And you being tired
There's advantages to each From this position, I feel affinity for the both of them, which is confusing
But honestly, I should be careful because otherwise, I'm being, I'm being, you know, what's it called?
Oh, fuck it Reclining, I'm getting used to it
Like kissing under a bridge
It's an entirely new discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery A couple of weeks at home
And then a couple of weeks away
And then home and away, again
To use up your desire for discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery For an instant, you could have pushed through
But it's a plagiarized regret anyway
But what you want for now is someone to feel you
And that's the thing you like, is planning to stay The return of the police! Sound of Silver talk to me
Makes you want to feel like a teenager
Until you remember the feelings of
A real live emotional teenager
Then you think again Sound of Silver talk to me
Makes you want to feel like a teenager
Until you remember the feelings of
A real live emotional teenager
Then you think again Sound of Silver talk to me
Makes you want to feel like a teenager
Until you remember the feelings of
A real live emotional teenager
Then you think again Sound of Silver talk to me
Makes you want to feel like a teenager
Until you remember the feelings of
A real live emotional teenager
Then you think again Sound of Silver talk to me
Makes you want to feel like a teenager
Until you remember the feelings of
A real live emotional teenager
Then you think again Sound of Silver talk to me

On with you tonight
When I was a little boy
I laid down in the grass
I'm sure you'd feel the same if I
Could fuck you here tonight But I'm never as tired as when I'm waking up
No, I'm never as tired as when I'm waking up
But it feels like I'm in love again
No, it feels like I'm in love again
Though it feels like I'm in love again
With what you do If we made it happen
I'm sure what we would do
Run outside and fuck someone
To show it didn't mean a thing
Seems it could be simple
If I could just grow up
Never gonna get it now
'Cause I'll never grow But I'm never as tired as when I'm waking up
No, I'm never as tired as when I'm waking up
And it feels like I'm in love again
No, it feels like I'm in love again
Though it feels like I'm in love again
With what you do But not with you
(Keep on telling myself it's true)
But not with you
(I keep on telling myself it's true)
But not with you
(I keep on telling myself it's true)
But not with you
(Keep on telling myself it's true)
But not with you
(Just keep on telling myself it's true)
But not with you
(Keep on telling myself it's true)
But not with you
(Just keep on telling myself it's true)
But not with you
(Just keep on telling myself it's true)
But not with you
(Just keep on telling myself it's true)
But not with you
(Just keep on telling myself it's true) Wake up with somebody near you
And at someone else's place
You took acid and looked in the mirror
Watched the beard crawl around on your face
Oh, the revolution was here
That would set you free from those bourgeoisie
In the morning everything's clearer
When the sunlight exposes your age But that's okay
And that's okay Grab your clothes and head to the doorway
If you dance out, no one complains
Find the place where you can be boring
Where you won't need to explain
That you're sick in the head and you wish you were dead
Or at least instead of sleeping here you prefer your own bed, come on
You just suck at self-preservation
Versus someone else's pain So you feel drained
And insane
And insane He was leather and you were screaming
Swinging chains against the stage
And you couldn't know he was leaving
But now more will go with age, you know
So get up and stop your complaining
You know that you're the only one who's been destroying all the fun
Look what happened when you were dreaming
Then punch yourself in the face
So you kiss and you clutch but you can't fight that feeling
That your one true love is just awaiting your big meeting
So you never even asked for names
You just look right through them as if you already came
It's a drug of the heart and you can't stop the shaking
'Cause the body wants what it's terrible at taking, oh
And you can't remember the meaning
But there's no going back against this California feeling American dream
(sha-bang, sha-bang)
American dream
(sha-bang, sha-bang)
American dream
(sha-bang, sha-bang)
American dream
(sha-bang, sha-bang) You wanted a hit but maybe we don't do hits
I try and try, it ends up feeling kind of wrong
You wanted it tough but is it ever tough enough?
No, nothing's ever tough enough until we hit the road Yeah, you wanted it lush but honestly you must hush
No honestly you know too much so leave us, leave us on our own
And so you wanted a hit, well, this is how we do hits
You wanted the hit but that's not what we do You wanted it real but can you tell me what's real?
There's lights and sounds and stories, music's just a part
Yeah, you wanted the truth and then you said you want proof
I guess you're used to liars saying what they want And we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
'Til you take us home No, we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We can't be your babies
'Til you take us home Yeah, you wanted it smart but honestly I'm not smart
No, honestly we're never smart, we fake it, fake it all the time
Yeah, you wanted the time but maybe I can't do time
Oh, we both know that's an awful line but it doesn't make it wrong You wanted it right, no out of mind and out of sight
No dirty bus and early flight, no seven days and forty nights
Yeah, you wanted a hit but tell me where's the appointment?
You wanted the hit but that's not what we do And we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore

Starry eyes, doo doo Late night, miss the train
Waiting in the rain
All night on the floor
And my fearosaur Fool's out on the make
School's out and it's late
It's you I'm waiting for
Want to see you more, see you more Starry eyes, doo doo
Starry eyes, doo doo
Starry eyes, doo doo
Starry eyes, doo doo Fool's out on the make
School's out and it's late
it's you I'm waiting for
Want to see you more, see you more Uh huh
Uh huh Starry eyes, doo doo
Starry eyes, doo doo Bright lights in my eyes
Got me hypnotised
Late night on the floor
Wanting so much more, so much more Starry eyes, doo doo
Starry eyes, doo doo
Starry eyes, doo doo
Starry eyes, doo doo
Starry eyes, doo doo Home- home in the late-night
and away- away in the half-life
except Saturday- crushed by the boring
until played and plagued again by the tourists When once you had believed it
now you see it's sucking you in To string you along with the pretense
and pave the way for the coming release Alone and prone in the half-light
and late- late to the real-life
if you find a way into the gold rush
you will stay until the morning comes
You can normalize don't it make you feel alive
Get innocuous! I don't think that we will be pleased with this
We have waited for a long time
I recall the promises made to us
We've been patient for a long time One touch is never enough
You gave the opening, opening
One touch is never enough
People who need people to the back of the bus I don't see how we could be pleased with this
We've been waiting for a long time
I recall the promises made to us
We've been patient such a long time No one is dangerous
We are not dangerous
Unless we get a closer view One touch is never enough
People need to move to the back of the bus
One touch is never enough
Complicated people never do what you're told to One touch is never enough
People will need this in the back of the bus
One touch is never enough
People who need people are just people who need people One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough, one touch
People who need people are just people who need people I don't think that we will be pleased with this
We have waited such a long time
There's no way that we can be pleased with this
We've been waiting such a long time We've been waiting such a long time
We've been waiting such a long time
This is getting sort of unreasonable
But we've been waiting a very long time One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough, one touch
People who need people to the back of the bus No one is dangerous
No one is dangerous
'Til we get a closer view Your feet touch the floor
I just open the window and let the light in
The light burns your eyes
But it eases with each passing frame
Yeah, your head like a block
Stuffed with unwritten letters to some
Far away friends
Oh you'd write on your hand to remember
If someone, if someone would just, pass you a pen Make your way to the toilet
These morning illusions are all part of the dance
And these doors all have locks on them
Like tinfoil hats, man
Made for resisting (other voices)
Time isn't over, times aren't better
So it's letting you down
You keep dragging back to it
You keep going back to the well
Oh, that shit's a dictator
Time won't be messed with
Buddy, no no no
You can't be believed
And you cannot believe what you are told
You're still a baby now
You're still a baby now
You're still a baby with soft feet and everything
You're still a baby for better or worse
Or for an hour or so
Until it's (other voices) Please, if you're coming home
Take me to the side
I know that time changes
To runaway
From you You're still a pushover for passionate people
You're still a pushover for passionate people
And you're just a baby now
You're just a baby now
With those soft hands and dull eyes
Resisting (other voices) And you're still a pushover for passionate people
You're still a pushover for passionate people
You're still a pushover for passionate people
You're still a
Tell 'em Nancy This is what's happening and it's freaking you out
I've heard it, heard it
And it sounds like the 90's
Who can you trust?
And who are your friends?
Who is impossible?
And who is the enemy?
These are the halls that we're presently haunting
And these were the people we currently haunt
Push back the walls
Push back the calendar
We've got, we've got friends who are calling us home You're just a baby now
You're just a baby now
You're just a baby now
You're just a baby now
You're just a baby now
You're just a baby now
You should be uncomfortable

My favorite song
My favorite song
Reminds me of the first time I went to space
It was such a long journey
It took hours, days, years
But when it was over... Oh, it takes me back
That takes me back to the first time
I stepped into space
You were there!
You were there with all my best friends! I remember!
I remember the look on your face!
The way you said, with your eyes.
You said... And then I slipped out of the Sun's sphere of influence
Nothing was happening
It was so dizzying And then you took everything from me
I was left here, a shell of my self
I was left here to pick up the pieces
And every piece was... la
Give me love That's when you saved me
At the last possible moment
You brought you big hand out
And scooped up my shit
And took me home That day you gave a new faith
In how people can save one another
Instead of always putting out their hands
To crush When you're out in space
You feel so good
Nanana nanana nanana nana When you're out in space
You feel so good
Nanana nanana nanana nana When you're out in space
You feel so good
Nanana nanana nanana nana When you're out in space
You feel so good When you're out in space
You feel so good
Nanana nanana nanana nana When you're out in space
You feel so good When you're out in space
You feel so good
Nanana nanana nanana nana When you're out in space
You feel so good 
 Oh, baby
Oh, baby
You're having a bad dream
Here in my arms Oh. sugar
You came to me
Could all be a bad thing
Doing harm
Oh oh oh Oh. lover
You run from me
We move like a bad scene
Shot in the dark Oh, but please
Please wake me
For my love lies patiently
Please baby, please
And my love life waits for me Oh, love
You came to me
Are you having a bad time?
There in your home Oh, sugar
Give into me
You're just having a bad dream
Of ringing alarms Oh, but please
Please shake me from my lovesick patient dream
Please baby, please
And my love plays wait and see Oh, I'm on my knees
Yeah, I'm on my knees
I promise I'm clean
But my love life waits You're already gone
Yeah, you're already gone
We are already home
My love life stumbles on Oh, baby
Lean into me
There's always a side door
Into the dark
Into the dark Shh Drunk girls

Drunk girls are unusually mild

Drunk boys keep in pace with the pedophiles

Drunk girls are boringly wild (Drunk girls)
Drunk girls get invitations from nations

They got the patience of a million saints

Drunk girls can be just as insane Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together

That means making eyes across the room (Drunk girls)
Just 'cause I'm shallow doesn't mean that I'm heartless
(Drunk girls)
Just 'cause I'm heartless doesn't mean that I'm mean
(Drunk boys)
Sometimes love gives us too many options
(Drunk girls)
Just 'cause you're hungry doesn't mean that you're lean (Drunk girls)
I've heard lies that could curdle your heartstrings
(Drunk girls)
A couple truths, maybe burn out your eyes

Honestly, honestly, honestly
Unless it hurts, why do it?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Oh It's time to get away,
It's time to get away,
From you. It's time to get away,
It's time to get away,
From you. You brought a lot of money
But me, I?
And you, you make me sleep,
I tried and tried.
But you undermine me,
And I start to be sensible
(If you know what I mean). And so it's time to get away,
It's time to get away,
From you. I'm dying to get away,
I'm dying to get away. And next time we'll talk it over.
And we can start again. Shocked! For you,
I caught a lot of static.
And me,
I'm like an automatic.
Oh what, what, what, what, what
Did you think would happen next?
Oh what, what, what, what, what
Could it ever be? So it's time to get away,
It's time to get away
From you. I'm dying to get away,
I'm dying to get away. And next time let's talk about it.
Or maybe start again. Shocked!
To think I used to pity you.
To think I used to pity you,
It's true.
To think I used to pity you.
To think i used to talk to you,
It's true. Next time we can talk about it,
Or even start again.
I couldn't tell you what you wanted. Know what I'm sayin'?
I knew you were low, man,
But the truth is I was shocked. Blood! 
Power! 
Eyes! 
Eyes never lie! 
Kids! 
Kids never lie! It's like a movement from the small place 
To a bigger city 
Or it's a bigger bag to strap the ego of a little baby 
It's like a discipline without the discipline of 
All of the discipline 
It's like a culture 
Without the effort of all the culture  Oh but I'm tapped 
Yr pillaging and I'm tapped 
Yr yesterday 
And I'm tapped 
Another reason I'm tapped  It's like a movement 
Without the bother of the meaning 
It's like a discipline 
Without the discipline of all of the discipline 
It's like a fat guy in a T-shirt 
Doing all the saying 
It's like a couple dads and a few friends 
Trying hard to stay in  Yr history and I'm tapped 
Yr fast and easy 'n I'm tapped 
Yr pillaging 
And I'm tapped 
For best results well I'm tapped  Here comes the report nothing to report see 
It's all the same 
It seems the punk rock as an experiment well 
It pulled up lame 
You got the fat guy in the T-Shirt 
Doing all the singing 
Straight to the drunk tank doing the research 'n 
Doing all the blame  Yr history and I'm tapped 
Yr fast asleep and I'm tapped 
Yr pillaging and I'm tapped 
For best results well I'm tapped  It's like the culture 
Without the effort or all of the luggage 
It's like a discipline 
Without the discipline of all of the discipline 
It's like a movement 
Without the bother of the meaning 
It's like a culture 
Without the culture of all of the culture  Yr history and I'm tapped 
Yr fast'n'easy 
And Im tapped 
Yr pillaging and I'm tapped 
And yr finiky so I'm tapped Everybody makes mistakes,
But I feel alright when I come undone
You're not not making me wait,
But it seems alright as long as something's happening I try to make you late,
But you fight me out like a fire does
You try making me wait,
But it feels alright as long as something's happening. Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations You try to make me wait
You come around when it's come undone
Everybody makes you late,
And it's never you, because you're always thinkin'
I try making you wait,
And you give me some like you give it good
Everybody makes mistakes,
But it seems it's mine that always keep on stingin' Get your payments from the nation
For your trial and tribulations

i'm sure you'd feel the same
if i could fuck you here tonight
but i'm never as tired as when i'm waking up
i'm never as tired as when i'm waking up
but it feels like i'm in love again
oh it feels like i'm in love again
though it feels like i'm in love again
with what you do
if we made it happen
i'm sure what we would do
run outside and fuck someone
to show it didn't mean a thing
seems it could be simple
if i could just grow up

cause i'll never grow
but i'm never as tired as when i'm waking up i'm never as tired as when i'm waking up

but not with you
(just keep on telling myself it's true)
but not with you
(just keep on telling myself it's true) Standing on the shore, facing east
I can't feel you Standing on the shore, facing east
Your impermanence
You're taking water
Listing lazily out of view I remember when we were friends
I remember calling you friend Standing on the shore my ear aimed east
I can't hear you
I can't hear you anymore
I can't hear you
I can't hear you anymore I still remember
Laughing and fighting
I still remember Standing on the shore, watching for you
You're painted into a corner
Whatever fits in your pockets; you'll get your due
Just like before
With all the others You warned me about the cocaine
Then dove straight in
Yeah, you warned me about the cocaine
Then dove straight in In hiding, where there's more for you
(There's more for you) Standing on the shore, getting off
You left me here amid the vape clowns
I must admit I missed the mountain
But not so much you One step forward
One step forward
One step forward
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back Standing on the floor, facing you
I can't see you, your impermanence
This place is empty
Empty of you And if I see you, it's like nothing went wrong
Yeah, if we meet again tomorrow, just like nothing went wrong
But they... Erasing our chances just by asking "how do you sleep?" One step forward
One step forward
One step forward
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back
And six steps back

 Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
i get all confused when you mix up the dates...
woah! don't gimme the pretend you come for the weekend
and you stay for the week
you say that you hate it but that's how you made it
just keep it oblique
we're both high high high, high high on lemon sips
we're all suh-suh-suh sucked-in-by parlour tricks oh the people deceive you the kids never leave
cuz you make them at home
you try to appease them and they show you the stick
but still you pick up the phone
but hey man, you can take it
as long as they don't shove you out in the cold
it's not getting better, no it's not getting better, man
it's just getting old
ah ooh! we do what we're programmed to do--
hey we do what we're told i never remember to carry my book when i get on the bus
you never forget it's your time to collect
when they are making a fuss
we're both high high high, high high on lemon sips
we're all high high high, high high on wiggling hips
ah ooh! you break off your plans for the weekend
and ah oh! you can tell them the dates
but that don't mean they're letting you go don't gimme the pretend you come for the weekend
and you stay for the year
avoid all the plans cuz we're making our day jobs
into a steady career
we're both high high high, high high on lemon sips
we all claw claw claw, cli-climb-on to sinking ships
and ah ooh! avoid all the cold sideways glances
and ah ooh! celebrate! celebrate! celebrate!
and then turn to stone read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
you turn 25 and now you're all out of escapes
c'mon hey the rock writer told me to tell you:
"though you're great and you're brave
you still lack that which makes you a star."
read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
we all get a little drunk and then we act like apes
ow! Everybody's singing the same song
It goes: tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I never realized these artists thought so much about dying But truth be told we all have the same end
Could make you cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
But I'm telling you
This is the best news you're getting all week Oh sure it's ruling the airwaves
What remains of the airwaves
And we're frankly thankful for the market psychology you're hipping us to And all the hits are saying the same thing
There's only tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
And life is finite
But shit, it feels like forever
It feels like forever Oh, is everybody feeling the same stuff?
We're all wild
Except for you
And you know who you are
This is a love song And you're getting older
I promise you this, you're getting older
And there's improvements unless
You're such a winner
That the future's a nightmare
And there's nothing I can do
Nothing anyone can do about this And oh oh, I'm offering you a chance to get even
But oh oh, you know very well the dialect of negation
Sure enemies haunt you with spit and derision
But friends are the ones who can put you in an exile
But that's not right And you're too sharp to be used
Or you're too shocked from being used
By these bullying children of the fabulous
Raffling off limited edition shoes And what's it you do again?
Oh, I'm a reminder
The hobbled veteran of the disk shop inquisition
Set to parry the cocksure of men's sick filth
With my own late era middle-aged ramblings
Every lover favors the same things
It's all: touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me tonight
We maybe realize what it is we need before we die And luck is always better than skill at things
We're flying blind
Oh good gracious
I sound like my mom But out of the little rooms and onto the streets
You've lost your internet and we've lost our memory
We had a paper trail that led to our secrets
But embarrassing pictures have now all been deleted
By versions of selves that we thought were the best ones
'Till versions of versions of others repeating
Come laughing at everything we thought was important
While still making mistakes that you thought you had learned from
And reasonable people know better than you
That cost in the long run but they don't know the short game
And terrible people know better than you
They're used and abused of the once so dear listener
So you will be badgered and taunted and told that
You're missing a party that you'll never get over
You hate the idea that you're wasting your youth
That you stood in the background, oh, until you got older
But that's all lies
That's all lies It's gonna have to be good enough
I can't do this anymore, my brain won't work I used to dance alone of my own volition
I used to wait all night for the rock transmissions
So where'd you go
You led me far away
And let me go
Let me go I used to see your hands in their weird positions
Used to like your head when you'd watch musicians
You said we'd know
Yeah, we'd know
But that's all wrong
That's all gone You made me throw my hands at my own traditions
And then you'd have a laugh at my inhibitions
Oh sure, we're talking tough
Yeah, we're talking tough
Yeah, we're talking tough
Put on Suburban Lawns
In prone positions Here we go
You led me far away
And let me go
I never fall away
Here we go
Yeah, we know
But that's all wrong
That's all wrong I'm still trying to wake up
I'm still trying to wake up
I'm still trying to wake up
I'm so tired to wake up I'm still trying to wake up

This is nowhere
We all, we all, we all, we all know this is nowhere
There is no one
Here It moves like a virus and enters our skin
The first sign divides us, the second is moving to Berlin
But that's not the state I'm in
The air is thin but that's not the state The old guys are frightened and frightening to behold
Their heads come out fighting and still doing what they're told
But you're waking a monster that will drive you from your orioles of gold
And your body will get cold And we don't waste time with love
It's just death from above Your head is on fire, your hands are getting weak
We all, we all get stupid in the heat
You've basted your brains with the shatter and defeat up on the street
And this is nowhere The early years were boring
The quiet, unhappy punk
See mother was a cripple and my father was a drunk but gentle man
So we do the best we can This is the plan
Wear your makeup like a man 'Cause we don't waste time with love
Yeah, we don't waste time with love
It's just a push and a shove Well, there's a full-blown rebellion but you're easy to confuse
By triggered kids and fakers and some questionable views
Oh, call the cops, call the preachers!
Before they let us and they lose When oh, we all start arguing the history of the Jews
You got nothing left to lose
Gives me the blues And we don't waste time with love
And we don't waste time with love So call the police
Yeah, call the police
Yeah, call the police
Yeah, call the police
Yeah, call the police
Yeah, call the police
Just chase the cops
Yeah, call the police
You're crazy, man
Yeah, call 'em up

Is a case of the ha ha ha ha's I ain't seen anyone for days
I still have yet to leave the bed
It's impossible
Feeling safe with it now
I'm impossible
Getting used to it now I've just got nothing left to say
I'm in no place to get it right
And I'm not dangerous now
The way I used to be once
I'm just too old for it now
At least that seems to be true I have a penny for your thoughts
If you could keep them to yourself
About you slipping away
I feel you slipping away
Don't want to hear it all now
Of how I'm slipping away I can't make you a promise
We're not professionals
But if we don't like what it feels like
And if we don't
Don't like where it's been It could be over if you change your mind
If you change your mind
If you change your mind
If you change your mind
If you change your mind
If you change your mind
You can change your mind
You can change your mind Somebody's calling me to be my girl
Somebody's calling me to be my girl
But my hands don't work; they're more like feet
And the wake-up call, "go back to sleep" Babe, come with me
And I'll take you to the place I sleep
Oh, darling, come with me
And I'll show you the place I sleep Somebody's phoning me to be my girl
Somebody's phoning me to be my girl
But the phone won't ring when I'm on the street
And the heart won't beat when I'm half asleep Somebody's texting me to be my girl
Constantly texting me to be my girl
But the text won't take away nights that creep
And my mouth won't move when I'm in too deep Babe, come with me
And I'll take you to the place I sleep
Oh, darling, come with me
And I'll show you the place I sleep All right Somebody's calling me into their work
Wrapped up and full of good inside their work
But the car won't start when I'm half asleep
And the kids don't cry when you're on your feet Babe, come with me
And I'll show you the place I sleep
Oh, darling, come with me
And I'll take you to the place I live
The place I live
The place I live
The place I live
The places where I live I'm not sure I want to step outside with my
Emotional haircut
It seems that I've been misunderstood
The look of great concern and the emotion in your eyes of my
Emotional haircut
It's better to me
It's much better than it used to be
Cause I got eyes going every which way
I got eyes all over the place
And I got tired of the hotel room and the TV
You missed that you've been told about whatever
Led to this emotional haircut
It ain't a disease
It's just harder to do whatever you please
And dream yourself tonight
To a little love life Now we all get ideas
I know I should shut em down with the
Emotional haircut
Now I ain't Dionysian, man
Oh no buddy, no need to be concerned with this
Emotional haircut
It's part of the game
Yeah man, it's just part of the feat
So let's raise a glass to the bodies in here
Oh, raise a glass to the bodies in here
We're gonna toast to the bodies all soak up the bass
Man, you're in love with the bodies in here and your
Emotional haircut
Oh just get on the street
Fuck the shuffle, put this shit on repeat
You've got numbers on your phone of the dead that you can't delete
And you got life-affirming moments in your past that you can't repeat
Yeah you've numbers on your phone of the dead that you cannot delete
And you're losing all your skin to bones when you just can't sleep
I know you can't calm down Out of your windows and onto the streets
Out of your windows
Out to the
Out to You know what it does
It puts me up on my feet
It puts me on the floor
But can you hear the heartbeat
Can you hear the heartbeat

And here comes the new stylish creep
From every car in the street
On repeat

They can tell everybody else
What you really want
Then you're fucked, so
Act like it's for yourself or its all yours
And they go and tell everybody else
That you're really great
We are just people You're enfranchised and entrenched
You're enfranchised and entrenched
But know that it's yours
Real life's a compromise But your? streak is beating on me

And it takes like you're full of love
Still the time never to pay on
Still the time never to pay on And it feels like I'm coming home
And it's still like a merry cow
And it feels like it's coming home
And it feels like it's full of love
Still in time is the great release
Something dying will be a great release Christmas will break your heart
If your world is feeling small
And there's no one on your phone
You feel close enough to call
Christmas will crush your soul
Like that laid back rock 'n' roll
But your body's getting old
It's much too tired to be so bold
Christmas can wreck your head
Like some listless awkward sex
So you refuse to leave your bed
Get depressed when no one checks
Christmas will break your heart
Like the armies of the unrelenting dark
Once the peace talks fall apart But still I'm coming home to you Christmas will shove you down
So just lay back in the snow
That quiet wind won't wake
What inside you has grown cold
Christmas will drown your love
Like a storm down from above
On your fading memories of a normal life
Oh while I thought to make you mine
Believing in the line
That your heart would melt with time
And though you're out with them again
Your thick and fickle friends
They might replace the love that ends But still I'm coming home to you
To you
To you
To you
Yes you
To you
To you
To you What if you're done?
What if you don't want it anymore?
So what if they're gone?
So what if they don't love you anymore? I'm coming home
Can you see me?
Can you still see me?
Hey mama, take my hand!

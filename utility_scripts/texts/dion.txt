Dion

When she kissed me I was born and she said goodbye
And I knew right away I was born to cry
Now I'm happy and the joke's on her
Cause I found that place for lover's who wander

She took my love, said she's not comin back
So my world and my sky was all turnin black
Now I see the light, I'm wise to her
Cause I found that place for lovers who wander

A walkin around thinkin about her
Never thought I could live without her
She broke my heart, I really showed it
Look at me now, you'd never know it

Now my story can be told with a smiling face
I'm the luckiest guy in the human race
My dreams have gone for her

FADE LONELY TEENAGER
Dion I wanna go home
Where I belong

When I was 16 ran away
All alone on a stray
What can I do what can I say

Now I'm 17 still alone
Wondering if I should go home
Or maybe stay out on my own
I'm a lonely teenager
I'd love to go back home (back home)
Where I belong (back home)
I know I'd be alright
If I just stay out of sight

Lonely teenager...(fades out) 
tmazanec1@juno.com or Tom Mazanec to humans Do you remember on the night that we first met
the moment I looked in your eyes I never will forget
And I remember oh the time that we kissed
remember thinking to myself could it really be like this And we danced beneath a midnight moon
and I took one lock
one look at you
And I fell in love before I knew
and the night stood still
and we moved so sweet
so sweet and slow
to the rhythm of the radio
And then your arms reached out and held me close
and the night stood still I will remember the song that they were playing then
and if I close my eyes I answer
we're right back there again
Do you remember oh the way it used to be
We were two hearts on the run
So young as wild as free CHORUS The night stood still
we danced
danced
we fell in love Do you remember oh the way it used to be... I must be crazy now
Maybe I dream too much
But when I think of you
I long to feel your touch
To whisper in your ear
Words that are old as time
Words only you would hear
If only you were mine
I wish I could go back to the very first day I saw you
Should've made my move when you looked in my eyes
'Cause by now I know that you'd feel the way that I do
And I'd whisper these words as you'd lie here by my side
I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time
So today, I finally find the courage deep inside
Just to walk right up to your door
But my body can't move when I finally get to it
Just like a thousand times before
Then without a word he handed me this letter
Read I hope this finds the way into your heart, it said
I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time
Well maybe I, I need a little love yeah
And maybe I, I need a little care
And maybe I, maybe you, maybe you, maybe you
Oh you need somebody just to hold you
If you do, just reach out and I'll be there
I love you, please say
You love me too
Please say you love me too
Till the end of time
These three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Oh, I love you
Please say you love me too
Please please
Say you love me too
Till the end of time
My baby
Together, together, forever
Till the end of time
I love you
I will be your light
Shining bright
Shining through your eyes
My baby I was born in the Bronx on a strong day
I guess you can say
The beat in the street, the streetcar sound
The singin' in the moonlight, the pure light
The harmony's tight
Informed we can fight
We got heart
And for [unintelligible] Yo, when I'm inside a song
I'm strong, I can't go wrong, It's where I belong Come along, it's good, it's bad
Who said it was perfect
Only God is perfect
Only God is good Man he blessed me beyond my wildest dreams
I can sing from the highest mountain
I can sing from the highest rooftop
I'm talkin' life, I'm talkin' beauty
Truth, love, hate, scammin', lyin', dyin'
Yo, life is hard But life is the art
It's better to be clean than to be cluttered
Clean of soul, that is My God is the Creator, not a dictator,
He's the life-giving lover,
My father, no other, my brother, my best friend
Never lied to me, even died for me Life is good
We're talkin' you
We're talkin' sweet Sue
We're talkin' virtue
We're talkin' faith, hope, love, wisdom,
Courage, honesty, patience Then there's blue skies,
There's miracles
There's families and babies and crazies
Changes you won't believe
I got aces up my sleeve And God keeps blessin' me
In spite of me
He's the best
If I didn't know me I'd be impressed. I don't wanna underestimate what He can do in my life
He brought me you in my life
He brought me through all this strife
Everybody here, we've been through it all
Real joy, closeness, distance, journey, the ups, the downs
The issues, the tissues, the drugs, the thugs, the drinkin', the stinkin' thinkin',
Throw up, grow up Tears, fears, torn, mourn, reborn
Yo! Hallelujah! I've never been the same, took away my shame
I used to play the blame game
How lame
Man I got a wife who drives me sane Here I am authentic, genuine, a truth-teller, no bullshit
Don't have a fit,
God's on his throne
He's in control Heroes, villains, king, queens, saints, sinners,
James Dean, Norma Jean, mmm vanilla ice cream
Elvis, Buddy, Hank
Honky-tonk blues guitars, cars, bars Yo! Stand proud, rock around, do-wop, be-bop, rock-and-roll, good for the soul
The Yankees, JFK, I did it my way, rock and roll is here to stay
Ain't that the truth Martin Luther king, say what you mean, mean what you say, but don't be mean
I have a dream, he paid his dues, king of the delta blues
Elvis Aaron Presley played that thing, rock and roll king, I ride with the King of kings
He brought me through, thanks to you, and you and you.
Man I'm glad we've got each other, that's where it's at, no doubt about that, With great love and affection
The kid from the Bronx
Rave on. You can dance every dance with the guy who gives you the eye, let him hold you tight.
You can smile every smile for the man who held your hand 'neath the pale moonlight.
But don't forget who's taking you home, and in whose arms you're gonna be, so darling, save the last dance for me.
Mmm, oh I know that the music's fine, like sparkling wine, go and have your fun!
Laugh and sing, but while we're apart, don't give your heart to anyone!
But don't forget who's taking you home...
Mm, baby, don't you know I love you so, can't you feel it we will touch?
I will never, never let you go, I love you oh so much.
You can dance, go and carry on till the night is gone and it's time to go.
If he asks if you're all alone, can he take you home, you must tell him no. '
Cause don't forget who's taking you home... '
Cause don't forget who's taking you home, and in whose arms you're gonna be, so darling, save the last dance for me.
Mmm, save the last dance for me.
Mmm, save the last dance for me. Hitcher on the back road, man with his guitar
Said take me to the crossroads, crossroads ain't that far
He said you come up from the delta, He said he liked my car
He told me on the way there, he was born in sin
(What else is new?)
I said I ride that road yeah and, I know just where you been
I don't know where I'm headed, I can't go back again
You tell me what you got now, I'll tell you what you've lost
Tell me what you bought now, tell me what it cost
Look out of your window, gone like morning frost You know I took him to the crossroad, I took him down that day
Left him at the crossroads, saw him kneel and pray
In my rear view mirror, I watched him fade away
You know back in town they're talking, they say he sold his soul
They say he died for nothing, they dumped him in the hole
You know they're talking, say they dumped in a hole
He must be burning they say, burning black as coal I said they don't know nothing, they don't know that man's blood
I say I saw that man rise from Mississippi mud
I said that man was clean, as Jack from Jordan's flood
He went down to the crossroad, and fell down on his knees
Yes Lord above have mercy, he said save poor Bob if you please
He sure is star in heaven, burning 'bove the seas
He sure is star in heaven, burning bright above the seas. Every night I hope and pray

Runaway And I wonder a where she will stay My little runaway
A run run run run runaway I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine I walk the line I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine I walk the line As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine I walk the line You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine I walk the line I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine I walk the line
Because you're mine I walk the line
Because you're mine I walk the line Rest your head on my shoulder and sleep
And I will close mine
Let's pretend that we're both counting sheep

(fade) The night was clear, and the moon was yellow
And the leaves came tumblin' down. . .
I was standin' on the corner
When I heard my bull dog bark.
He was barkin' at the two men
Who were gamblin' in the dark.
It was Stagger Lee and Billy,
Two men who gambled late.
Stagger lee threw a seven,
Billy swore that he threw eight. "
Stagger Lee," said Billy,"
I can't let you go with that."
You have won all my money,"
And my brand-new Stetson hat." Stagger Lee went home
And he got his .
He said, "
I'm goin' to the ballroom"
Just to pay that debt I owe." Go, Stagger Lee Stagger Lee went to the ballroom
And he strolled across the ballroom floor.
He said "
You did me wrong, Billy."
And he pulled his .
Stagger Lee," said Billy,"
Oh, please don't take my life!"
I've got three hungry children,"
And a very sickly wife." Stagger Lee shot Billy
Oh, he shot that poor boy so hard
That a bullet went through Billy
And broke the bartender's bar.
Go, Stagger Lee, go, Stagger Lee!
Go, Stagger Lee, go, Stagger Lee!(to fade) My love, we have seen it all
The endless confession, The rise and fall
As fragile as a child
But lately I'm sorry I can't hold a smile But I stand tall to get by
No matter how hard I try to hide
How did you know I'd take the time for you
How did you know that I would see you through
How did you know that I would play the part
I must've made it clear right from the start My love, can you give me strength
Somehow I forgot how to ease my pain
I know I'm right where I belong
Something from nothing never proved me wrong But I stand tall to get by
No matter how hard I try to hide
How did you know I'd take the time for you
How did you know that I would see you through
How did you know that I would play the part
I must've made it clear right from the start I would share my whole life with you
Would you do the same for me
I would give all I am to you
Would you do the same for me And I will stand tall to get by
No matter how hard I try to hide
Could you see I could break
Did you notice all my mistakes
There were times I could feel you read my mind
How did you know I'd take the time for you
How did you know that I would see that through
How did you know that I would play the part
I know I made it clear right from the start Well you know Katie Mae is a good girl
Folks say she don't run around at night

But I say she got to be a T-model Ford
Yes she got the shape all right, but she can't carry no heavy load. And she walks JUST LIKE
Her daddy got oil wells in his backyard
Every time she got to working that woman she never has to work too hard. I say bye-bye poor Katie Mae

fades Awcantor@AOL.com So be careful of stones that you throw Oh, a tongue can accuse and carry bad news
Gossip is cheap and it's low
So unless you've made no mistakes in your life
Just be careful of stones that you throw A neighbor was passin' my garden one time
She stopped and I knew right away
That it was gossip, not flowers, she had on her mind
And this is what I heard my neighbor say "You know, that girl down the street
Should be run from our midst
She drinks and she talks quite a lot
She knows not to speak to my child or me"
My neighbor then smiled and I thought Oh, a tongue can accuse and carry bad news
Gossip is cheap and it's low
But unless you've made no mistakes in your life
Be careful of stones that you throw Just then a car speeded by in the screamin' of brakes
A sound that made my blood chill
For my neighbor's one child had been pulled from the path
And saved by a girl lyin' still The child was unhurt and my neighbor cried out
"Oh, who was that brave girl so sweet?"
I covered the crushed broken body and said
"The bad girl who lived down the street" So unless you've made no mistakes in your life
Just be careful of stones that you throw Well I left my home down on the rural route

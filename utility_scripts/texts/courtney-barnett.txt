You said we should look out further
I guess it wouldn't hurt us
We don't have to be around all these coffee shops
Now we got that percolator
Never made a latte greater
I'm savin' twenty three dollars a week
We drive to a house in Preston
We see police arresting
A man with his hand in a bag
How's that for first impressions
This place seems depressing
It's a California bungalow in a caul-de-sac
It's got a lovely garden
A garage for two cars to park in
Or a lot of storage if you've just got one
And it's going pretty cheap you say
Well it's a deceased's estate
Aren't the pressed Metal ceilings great
And I see the hand rail in the shower
A colleciton of those canisters for coffee tea and flower
And a photo of a young man in a van in Vietnam
And I can't think of floor boards anymore
Whether the front room faces south or north
And I wonder what she bought it for
If you've got a spare half a million
You could knock it down and start rebuilding I sleep in late
Another day
Oh what a wonder
Oh what a waste.
It's a monday
It's so mundane
What exciting things
Will happen today?
The yard is full of hard rubbish it's a mess and
I guess the neighbours must think we run a meth lab
We should ammend that
I pull the sheets back
It's 40 degrees
And i feel like i'm dying.
Life's getting hard in here
So i do some gardening
Anything to take my mind away from where it's sposed to be.
The nice lady next door talks of green beds
And all the nice things that she wants to plant in them
I wanna grow tomatoes on the front steps.
Sunflowers, bean sprouts, sweet corn and radishes.
I feel pro-active
I pull out weeds
All of a sudden
I'm having trouble breathing in.
My hands are shaky
My knees are weak
I can't seem to stand
On my own two feet
I'm breathing but i'm wheezing
Feel like i'm emphysem-in'
My throat feels like a funnel
Filled with weetabix and kerosene and
Oh no, next thing i know
They call up triple o
I'd rather die than owe the hospital
Till I get old
I get adrenalin
Straight to the heart
I feel like Uma Thurman
Post-overdosing kick start
Reminds me of the time
When i was really sick and i
Had too much psuedoefedryn and i
Couldn't sleep at night
Halfway down high street, andy looks ambivalent
He's probably wondering what i'm doing getting in an ambulance
The paramedic thinks i'm clever cos i play guitar
I think she's clever cos she stops people dying
Anaphylactic and super hypocondriactic
Should've stayed in bed today
I much prefer the mundane.
I take a hit from
An asthma puffer
I do it wrong
I was never good at smoking bongs.
I'm not that good at breathing in. I love you, I hate you, I'm on the fence, it all depends
Whether I'm up or down, I'm on the mend, transcending all reality
I like you, despise you, admire you
What are we gonna do when everything all falls through?
I must confess, I've made a mess of what should be a small success
But I digress, at least I've tried my very best, I guess
This, that, the other, why even bother?
It won't be with me on my deathbed, but I'll still be in your head Put me on a pedestal and I'll only disappoint you
Tell me I'm exceptional, I promise to exploit you
Give me all your money, and I'll make some origami, honey
I think you're a joke, but I don't find you very funny My internal monologue is saturated analog
It's scratched and drifting, I've become attached to the idea
It's all a shifting dream, bittersweet philosophy
I've got no idea how I even got here
I'm resentful, I'm having an existential time crisis
Want bliss, daylight savings won't fix this mess
Under-worked and over-sexed, I must express my disinterest
The rats are back inside my head, what would freud have said? Put me on a pedestal and I'll only disappoint you
Tell me I'm exceptional, I promise to exploit you
Give me all your money, and I'll make some origami, honey
I think you're a joke, but I don't find you very funny I wanna wash out my head with turpentine, cyanide
I decide this internal diatribe
When I try to catch you right, I hate seeing you cry
In the kitchen, I don't know why it affects me like this
When you're not even mine to consider
Erroneous, harmonious, I'm hardly sanctimonious
Dirty clothes, I suppose we all outgrow ourselves
I'm a fake, I'm a phony, I'm awake, I'm alone
I'm homely, I'm a scorpio Put me on a pedestal and I'll only disappoint you
Tell me I'm exceptional, I promise to exploit you
Give me all your money, and I'll make some origami, honey
I think you're a joke, but I don't find you very funny Oliver Paul, twenty years old
Thick head of hair, worries he's going bald
Wakes up at quarter past nine
Fair evades his way down the 96 tram line
Breakfast on the run again, he's well aware
He's dropping soy linseed Vegemite crumbs everywhere Feeling sick at the sight of his computer
He dodges his way through the Swanston commuters
Rips off his tie, hands it to a homeless man
Sleeping in the corner of a metro bus stand and he screams
"I'm not going to work today
Going to count the minutes that the trains run late
Sit on the grass building pyramids out of Coke cans" Headphone wielding to the Nicholas building
He trips on a pothole that's not been filled in
He waits for an elevator, one to nine
A lady walks in and waits by his side
Her heels are high and her bag is snakeskin
Hair pulled so tight you can see her skeleton
Vickers perfume on her breath
A tortoise shell necklace between her breasts
She looks him up and down with a botox frown
He's well used to that look by now
The elevator dings and they awkwardly step in
Their fingers touch on the rooftop button Don't jump little boy, don't jump off that roof
You've got your whole life ahead of you, you're still in your youth
I'd give anything to have skin like you He said "I think you're projecting the way that you're feeling
I'm not suicidal, just idling insignificantly
I come up here for perception and clarity
I like to imagine I'm playing SimCity
All the people look like ants from up here
And the wind's the only traffic you can hear"
He said "All I ever wanted to be
Was an elevator operator, can you help me please?" Jen insists that we buy organic vegetables
And I must admit that I was a little skeptical at first
A little pesticide can't hurt
Never having too much money, I get the cheap stuff at the supermarket
But they're all pumped up with the shit
A friend told me that they stick nicotine in the apples If you can't see me, I can't see you
If you can't see me, I can't see you Heading down the Highway Hume
Somewhere at the end of June
Taxidermied kangaroos are lifted on the shoulders
A possum Jackson Polluck is painted on the tar
Sometimes I think a single sneeze could be the end of us
My hay-fever is turning up, just swerved into a passing truck
Big business overtaking
Without indicating
He passes on the right, been driving through the night
To bring us the best price If you can't see me, I can't see you
If you can't see me, I can't see you More people die on the road than they do in the ocean
Maybe we should mull over culling cars instead of sharks
Or just lock them up in parks where we can go and view them
There's a bypass over Holbrook now
Paid for with burgers no doubt
I've lost count of all the cows
There'll be no salad sandwiches
The law of averages says we'll stop in the next town
Where petrol price is down...
What do I know anyhow? If you can't see me, I can't see you
If you can't see me, I can't see you
If you can't see me, I can't see you
If you can't see me, I can't see you I stare at the lawn, it's Wednesday morning
It needs a cut but I leave it growing
All different sizes and all shades of green
Slashing it down just seems kind of mean
In a way it's a a shame you get a way
Thinking it's just a game
Who am I to deny myself a pawn for you to use?
At the end of the day it's a pain that I keep seeing your name
But I'm sure it's a bore being you I don't know quite who I am, oh but man I am trying
I make mistakes until I get it right
An eye for an eye for an eye for an eye for an eye
I don't agree with that, why can't we just talk nice? Oh! The calamity, I wanna go to sleep for an eternity
Who am I to deny myself a pawn?
Oh! The humanity I wanna disappear into obscurity
But I'm sure it's a bore being you I don't know quite who I am, oh but man I am trying
I make mistakes until I get it right
An eye for an eye for an eye for an eye for an eye
I used to hate myself but now I think I'm alright I don't know quite who I am, oh but man I am trying
I make mistakes until I get it right
An eye for an eye for an eye for an eye for an eye
I dreamed I stabbed you with a coat hanger wire All my clothes in milk crates, I don't sleep for days
Wait until the letter's read, until my bills get paid
Ah, tell me, tell me, tell me
When's it gonna change?
Ah, tell me, tell me, tell me
When's it gonna change? Every morning I feel more useless than before
Trying hard to see the point in anything at all
Oh, I've been trying
I've been trying really hard
Yeah, I've been trying
I've been trying really hard Pull yourself together, pick myself apart
Nothing lasts for never, so be still my bleeding heart
Oh, I've been dreaming
Dreaming of a brand new start
Yeah, I've been dreaming
Dreaming of a brand new start Oh, you have a great abundance of axes there to grind
Remember some people have real problems next time you whine
Oh, hang the washing
Hang the washing on the line
Yeah, hang the washing
Hang the washing on the line Yeah, I've been trying
I've been trying really hard
Oh, tell me, tell me, tell me
When's it gonna change? Watermarks on the ceiling
I can see Jesus and he's frowning at me
I see a dead seal on the beach
The old man says he's already saved it three times this week
Guess it just wants to die
I would wanna die too
With people putting oil into my air
But to be fair, I've done my share
Guess everybody's got their different point of view I was walking down Sunset Strip, Phillip Island, not Los Angeles
Got me some hot chips and a cold drink
Took a sandy seat on the shore
There's a paper on the ground, it makes my headache quite profound
As I read it out aloud
It said "The Great Barrier Reef it ain't so great anymore
It's been raped beyond belief, the dredgers treat it like a whore"
I drank 'til I was sinking, sank 'til I was thinking
That I'm thankful for this view
We either think that we're invincible or that we are invisible
When realistically we're somewhere in between
We all think that we're nobody but everybody is somebody else's somebody Don't ask me what I really mean
I am just a reflection
Of what you really wanna see
So take you want from me Don't ask me what I really mean
I am just a reflection
Of what you really wanna see
So take you want from me Don't ask me what I really mean
I am just a reflection
Of what you really wanna see
So take you want from me So take what you want from me
So take what you want from me
So take what you want from me
So take what you want from me
So take what you want from me
So take what you want from me
So take what you want from me
So take what you want from me Satellites on the ceiling
I can see Jesus and she's smiling at me
All I wanna say is... I masturbated to the songs you wrote
Resuscitated all of my hopes
It felt wrong but it didn't take too long
Much appreciated are your songs. Doesn't mean I like you man
It just helps me get to sleep
And it's cheaper than Temazepam. I under-estimated your intelligence
A little bit of weed mixed with some sentiment
Over-rated films marked 'XXX'
Come on play it with some tenderness. You won't believe what I coulda told ya
But I don't believe I've the balls to let you know
I can say that 'cause I'm a man
But I feel like a little boy... today I cherish my intercontinental friendships
We talk it over continental breakfast
In a hotel in East Bumble-wherever
Somewhere on the sphere, around here I cherish my intercontinental friendships
Not much very big on enemies
So I kick a can way up into the sun, man
But it falls down into a ravine
I don't mean to even think about it that way, but I do Watchin' the waves come in at night
From my back porch stoop, porch swing swingin' on its own
See it's just an inhabitant of some holy ghost I walk like a bruised ego along shorefront property un-owned to me
But I'm feelin' inferior on the interior don't ya see
Guarded and sentimental (and after all, its just a rental)
(Like better luck performin' telekinesis on a priestess)
You won't believe what I mighta, coulda told ya
But I wouldn't wanna leave ya trippin' out over it
OK, more-so me, but...
(or just me) Watchin' the waves come in at night
From my back porch stoop, porch swing swingin' on its own
See it's just an inhabitant of some holy ghost I cherish my intercontinental friendships
We talk it over continental breakfast
In a hotel in East Bumble-wherever
Somewhere on the sphere, around here I say dance, you say dance,
I say France, you say France,
You're from Adelaide, I'm from Hobart, I say Hugh, you say Grant,
I say pot, you say plant,
You're from Adelaide, I'm from Hobart, We couldn't be more contrary if we tried,
Oh chalk and cheese we rarely see eye to eye, I am dumb, you are smart,
We are 15 years apart,
You're from Adelaide, I'm from Mars, I say ooh, you say aah,
I am careful, you like scars,
I like pickles from the jar, We couldn't be more contrary if we tried,
Oh chalk and cheese we rarely see eye to eye, I say you, you say am I,
You like mornings, I like nights,
I'll love you till the day I die, You say Christopher, I say Walken,
You love, I love Christopher Walken,
I guess at least we have got one thing in common, We couldn't be more contrary if we tried,
Oh chalk and cheese we rarely see eye to eye. Tell me when you're getting bored and I'll leave
I'm not the one who put the chain around your feet
I'm sorry for all of my insecurities, but they're just a part of me
"Envy is thin because it bites but never eats"
That's what a nice old Spanish lady once told me
"Hey Debbie-Downer turn that frown upside down and just be happy" I don't ask too much of you
It's true and I can't read your mind Don't stop listening, I'm not finished yet
I'm not fishing for your compliments I'm growing older every time I blink my eyes
Boring, neurotic, everything that I despise
We had some lows, we had some mids, we had some highs
Sell me all your golden rules and I'll see
If that's the kind of person that I wanna be
If I'm not happy I'll be glad I kept receipts I don't ask too much of you
It's true and I can't read your mind Don't stop listening, I'm not finished yet
I'm not fishing for your compliments
Don't stop listening, I'm not finished yet
I'm not fishing for your compliments
Don't stop listening, I'm not finished yet
I'm not fishing for your compliments
Don't stop listening, I'm not finished yet
I'm not fishing for your compliments I got drunk and fell asleep atop the sheets but luckily i left the heater on.
And in my dreams i wrote the best song that i've ever written...can't remember how it goes.
I stayed drunk and fell awake and i was cycling on a plane and far away i heard you say you liked me.
We drifted to a party - cool. The people went to arty school. They made their paints by mixing acid wash and lemonade
In my brain I re-arrange the letters on the page to spell your name
I found an ezra pound and made a bet that if i found a cigarette i'd drop it all and marry you.
Just then a song comes on: "you can't always get what you want" - the rolling stones, oh woe is we, the irony!
The stones became the moss and once all inhibitions lost, the hipsters made a mission to the farm.
We drove by tractor there, the yellow straw replaced our hair, we laced the dairy river with the cream of sweet vermouth.
In my brain I re-arrange the letters on the page to spell your name
You said "we only live once" so we touched a little tongue, and instantly i wanted to...
I lost my train of thought and jumped aboard the Epping as the doors were slowly closing on the world.
I touched on and off and rubbed my arm up against yours and still the inspector inspected me.
The lady in the roof was living proof that nothing really ever is exactly as it seems.
In my brain I re-arrange the letters on the page to spell your name
We caught the river boat downstream and ended up beside a team of angry footballers.
I fed the ducks some krill then we were sucked against our will into the welcome doors of the casino.
We drank green margaritas, danced with sweet senoritas, and we all went home as winners of a kind.
You said "i guarantee we'll have more fun, drink till the moon becomes the sun, and in the taxi home i'll sing you a triffids song!"
In my brain I re-arrange the letters on the page to spell your name Let's start an anonymous club, we can sit close in the dark.
Come round to mine, we can swap clothes and drink wine all night.
Turn your phone off friend, you're amongst friends and we don't need no interruptions.
Leave your shoes at the door, along with your troubles.
Let's start an anonymous club, I'll make us name badges with question marks.
Come round to mine, we can swap clothes and drink wine all night.
Turn your phone off friend, you're amongst friends and we don't need no interruptions.
Leave your shoes at the door, along with your troubles.
Thank you for cooking for me, I had a really nice evening, just you and me. I saw you in the lane next to me
You were doing freestyle, then you switched it around
To a little bit of backstroke
I couldn't see underneath
Your swimming cap, but it appeared that you had
Dark colored hair, maybe it was blonde for all I know
I had goggles on
They were getting foggy
I much prefer swimming to jogging I tried my very best to impress you
Held my breath longer than I normally do
I was getting dizzy
My hair was wet and frizzy
Felt my muscles burn, I took a tumble turn
For the worse, it's a curse
My lack of athleticism, sunk like a stone
Like a first owner's home loan
When I came to, you and your towel were gone 1, 2, 3, 4 I'm down to three packs a day
Of Mi Goreng, I can't explain it
Can't wait for you to go away
Cause I just crave that meager taste, yeah Boil it up, water in the sauce pan
In a cup, drink it from a silver spoon That MSG tastes good to me
I disagree with all your whining
It can't be true that they use glue to
Keep the noodles stuck together
Two minutes seems like a lifetime
Burn my tongue, patience is a virtue I'm down to three packs a day
I sneak away to find a kettle
I withdraw from all my friends
And their dinner plans, I'm sick of lentils Boil it up, water in a sauce pan
In a cup, drink it from a silver spoon It is no good
It is no good
You say, "it's no good for you" In my wallet is a photo of you
The day we split I ripped it in two
Stuck it back together with glue.
Tear my posters down from the wall
Don't wanna worship no dead heroes
Everything I owned I sold.
I got lost somewhere between here and there,
I'm not sure what the town was called.
In my pocket is a bottle of blue
Drink it when I'm feeling misconstrued
Don't like the taste but I like the overview.
I made a lot of money in my days
Spent it all on the current craze
I don't see no need to save.
I got lost somewhere between here and there,
I'm not sure what the town was called. I know that I let you down
You're not keen on what you found
When's the funeral?
Do you want me to come? I'm not what you're looking for
My house has an open door
You need a lock and key I love all of your ideas
You love the idea of me Lover, I've got no idea
Lover, I've got no idea
Lover, I've got no idea You said you liked me at a party
I said oh well um
Your flatmate was drinking whiskey
You asked me to get you some I stole your key from your apartment
So you'd have to come around
Stuffed balls of cotton to my sneakers
So I wouldn't make a sound I disconnected the gas heating
Then suggested movie nights
It got colder, you moved closer
So I cooked us Party Pie And I did everything to not let you know I liked you
And everything to let you know that I was still around Like swapping chairs and coughing loudly
Putting on your favorite songs
Standing hidden in the pantry
Hoping you would come along Like tracing lines into a napkin
To the shadows of your face
Like dropping you to choir practice
On my U12 study break And I did everything to not let you know I liked you
And everything to let you know that I was still around Outside the party it was raining
You were hailing me a cab
I had a plane at seven-thirty
Rain was dripping down my back I'm pretty sure you said you liked me
But a bottle smashed somewhere
You lent me your road map of Melbourne
I pretended not to care And I can't stop thinking about what would have happened
If I hadn't gone to Melbourne and gone out to your party Even though you didn't want me to
I just want you to know
There's still a spot left on my key ring
Just for you I found you at the store, pretty as porcelain
You are worth so much more, than what you're going for
Don't let them handle you, you better start praying
That ain't no way to be, I got a colour TV
I'll listen a thousand times, you can repeat yourself
If it helps clear your mind, it's just another night
Call me when you are done, I'll count my tickets up
No need to feel so low, you're just as low as you could go. Fear is like a forest
The dark of the unknown
Love is like a promise
That you'll never be alone Touch is like a tourist
You know when you are home
It's not that I'm a purist
It's just I'd rather be alone Books waiting to be written
Love is waiting to be loved
Songs here, underneath my fingers
Waiting to be sung Nothing will be written
And no-one ever will I love
No song will I be singing
If it's where I'm running off But I know that it works
'Cause I've seen that it's true
If you just let it go
It will come back to you It'll come back in space
It'll come back in pairs
It'll come back in ways
It'll come back 'cause it cares
Come back 'cause it cares
Come back 'cause it cares
Come back 'cause it cares But I know that it works
'Cause I've seen that it's true
If you just let it go
It will come back to you It'll come back in space
It'll come back in pairs
It'll come back in ways
It'll come back 'cause it cares
Come back 'cause it cares
Come back 'cause it cares
Come back 'cause it cares Tell me what you're thinking, what you're thinking about
Tell me when you're finished maybe I'll come around
Had enough to bring me all the way to the ground
I don't have to tell you what I'm thinking about
You have made your bed, I know better than to sleep in it
Better off dead than the hell that will become of it
You have hurt my head but I'm not denying
That I did not bring it on myself
I take pieces of myself from everyone around me
I'm not individual enough for you
I replicate the people I admire
But at least I'm not bitter and sad
I may not be 100% happy but at least I'm not with you. I walk slowly to the store
You don't live here anymore
You used to live round the corner
(cigarettes and alcohol)
Last week I turned twenty four
You don't call me anymore
We used to speak every morning
I was sleeping on the floor.
I still get the mail for
You I leave it at the door
Every letter seems a warning
Pay your rego by the fourth.
Monday morning laundry or
Coffee on the garden wall
You're good cos you're never boring
You should probably call me more. When I'm all alone on my own by my lonesome
And there ain't a single another soul around
I wanna dig into my guitar bend a blues riff that hangs
Over everything When I'm by myself and it's daytime 'cause down-under
Or wherever it is I live when it's evening
You know I speed read the morning news and come up with my own little song also
Too (Wooh) When I step outside to a beautiful morning
Where the trees are all wagging, my hair flag waving
The scenery raging, my life love cascading and the smog hangs
Over everything When I'm outside in a real good mood
You could almost forget about all the other things
Like a big old ominous cloud in my periphery Eh eh, ah ah ah, oh, eh eh eh Don't wanna talk about it
Simultaneous I shout it When I was young I liked to hear music blaring
And I wasn't caring to neuter my jams with earplugs
But these days I inhabitate a high-pitched ring over things
So these days I plug 'em up When I'm strugglin with my songs I do the same thing too
And then I crunch 'em up in headphones, 'cause why wouldn't you?
You could say: I hear you on several levels at high decibels
Over everything When I'm all alone on my own by myself
And there ain't a single another one around
I wanna dig into my guitar, bend a blues riff that hangs
Over everything Don't wanna talk about it Talk about it, talk about it
Talk about it, talk about it
Over everything
Talk about it
Don't wanna talk
Don't wanna talk
Ain't nobody wanna talk about it
Don't wanna
Don't wanna talk about it, about it
They don't wanna, oh they
They don't wanna talk about it
No, they don't wanna
Talk about it, about it
Oooh ooh ooh I sing high, you sing low
I swing by, and you're not home
Oh, oh, O-detta won't you come home.
I sing plain, you sing pretty.
Everything you say sounds easy
Oh, oh, O-detta won't you come home. I saw you in the lane next to me
You were doing freestyle, then you switched it around
To a little bit of backstroke
I couldn't see underneath
Your swimming cap, but it appeared that you had
Dark colored hair, maybe it was blonde for all I know
I had goggles on
They were getting foggy
I much prefer swimming to jogging I tried my very best to impress you
Held my breath longer than I normally do
I was getting dizzy
My hair was wet and frizzy
Felt my muscles burn, I took a tumble turn
For the worse, it's a curse
My lack of athleticism, sunk like a stone
Like a first owner's home loan
When I came to, you and your towel were gone I lay awake at four, staring at the wall
Counting all the cracks backwards in my best French
Reminds me of a book I skim-read in a surgery
All about palmistry, I wonder what's in store for me
I pretend the plaster is the skin on my palms
And the cracks are representative of what is going on
I lose a breath... my love-line seems intertwined with death I'm thinking of you too I lay awake at three, staring at the ceiling
It's a kind of off-white, maybe it's a cream
There's oily residue dripping from the kitchen
It's art-deco necromantic chic, all the dinner plates are kitsch with
Irish Wolf Hounds, French baguettes wrapped loose around their necks
I think I'm hungry, I'm thinking of you too I'm thinking of you too
I'm thinking of you too
I'm thinking of you too
I'm thinking of you too Wondering what you're doing, what you're listening to
Which quarter of the moon you're viewing from your bedroom
Watching all the movies, drinking all the smoothies
Swimming at the pool, I'm thinking of you too I'm thinking of you too
I'm thinking of you too
I'm thinking of you too
I'm thinking of you too
I'm thinking of you too
I'm thinking of you too
I'm thinking of you too
I'm thinking of you too You always get what you want
And you don't even try
Your friends hate it when its always going your way
But I'm glad that you've got luck on your side
You're saying definitely maybe
I'm saying probably no
You say "You sleep when you're dead,"
I'm scared I'll die in my sleep
I guess that's not a bad way to go I wanna go out but I wanna stay home
I wanna go out but I wanna stay home Why are you so eager to please?
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Gets harder in the winter, gotta be a fake or shiver
It takes a great deal out of me
Yes I like hearing your stories
But I've heard them all before
I'd rather stay in bed with the rain over my head
Than have to pick my brain up off of the floor I wanna go out but I wanna stay home
I wanna go out but I wanna stay home If you see me when I'm feeling down, I don't know if I want you around
Don't want you around...
I don't really like any of your friends, but it's not that hard for me to pretend
Hard to pretend...
Come on Davey, let's go plant a tree. You bring the spade, I'll bring the seeds
I'll bring the seeds... Are you working hard my darling, we're so worried, always thinking of you and we just want you to be so happy, keep on going.
I don't want no 9 to 5, telling me that I'm alive and 'Man, you're doing well!'
Have you got some money saved up for those rainy days? You should start some sort of trust fund just incase you fail
My friends play in bands, they are better than everything on radio.
Did you see that special on TV the other eve?
No my TV, it stopped working when we got here (it's been four years)
Are you eating? You sound so thin.
I don't know what I was thinking, I should get a job
I don't know what I was drinking, I should get a dog
Should get married, have some babies, watch the evening news. I was busy underwater seeing how long I could hold my breath.
A drowning flower caught my eye and I had to come on up for air.

She's so easy.
Climb aboard the wagon when it comes on through.
Jump up on your horse and tell me how's the view.
Look over my shoulder when I talk to you.
Where's the more important person in the room?
